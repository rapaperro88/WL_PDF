7543914,"Fluorescent conjugates of brefeldin A selectively stain the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex of living cells. The fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA) interferes with vesicular trafficking in most animal cells. To gain insight into the mechanism of BFA action, we esterified it to the fluorophore, boron dipyromethene difluoride (BODIPY). BODIPY-BEA localized predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex of viable cells and was extracted by detergent treatment, suggesting it interacts primarily with lipid bilayers. The localization of the conjugate is conferred by BFA, since free BODIPY or BODIPY esterified to cyclopentanol did not specifically localize to internal membranes. BODIPY-BFA exhibited a similar biological activity to BFA, but only when used at higher concentrations and after a delay. HPLC analysis revealed that over this period, cells converted BODIPY-BFA to species co-eluting with free BODIPY and BFA. Therefore, BODIPY-BFA is probably inactive until BFA is released by cellular esterases. The specific localization of BODIPY-BFA to the ER and Golgi complex suggests that BFA might exert its effects on vesicular trafficking by perturbing the lipid bilayer of its target organelles. Because BODIPY-BFA intensely stains the ER at concentrations that have no discernible effects on intracellular transport or other cellular functions, it should be useful for visualizing the ER in living cells.",Immunology
7543377,"Relationship between hprt mutant frequency, aromatic DNA adducts and genotypes for GSTM1 and NAT2 in bus maintenance workers. We have studied the mutant frequency in the human gene for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) using the T-cell cloning assay, the aromatic DNA adduct level using the 32P-postlabelling assay, and related the levels of these biomarkers to the genotypes for glutathione transferase (GST mu) and N-acetyltransferase (NAT2) in non-smoking bus maintenance workers exposed to diesel exhaust. No difference in mutant frequency was observed between the 47 exposed (8.6 x 10(-6), age range 27-65) and the 22 control individuals (8.4 x 10(-6), age range 23-61), while the difference in adduct level (3.2 versus 2.3 x 10(-8)) was highly significant (P = 0.0009). Both mutant frequency and adduct level were highest in the 16 most heavily exposed workers. Overall, a significant increase of mutant frequency was observed with adduct level (P = 0.008) as well as with age (P < 0.0001). The age dependence was higher in the GSTM1-negative slow acetylators (3.1%/year) as compared to the three other genotype combinations (2.4-2.5%/year). There was no significant difference in mutant frequency or in adduct level between the GSTM1-negative (49.3% of the population) and positive individuals, or between the slow (60.9% of the population) and rapid acetylators. Among the slow acetylators, however, a significantly higher adduct level (P = 0.03) was obtained for the GSTM1-negative individuals as compared to the GSTM1-positive individuals. These results suggest a possible role of both GST mu and NAT2 for individual susceptibility to carcinogen exposure.",Immunology
7543329,"Prostatic aperture resulting from visual laser ablation: classification system based on follow-up endoscopy. To study the evolving prostatic aperture created by visual laser ablation (VLAP), we performed 38 video-endoscopies in 24 men with prostatism at various intervals 2 weeks to 1 year after treatment. Complete healing was generally observed within 3 to 4 months, never before 6 weeks; and in some patients, tissue sloughing was still apparent beyond 6 months. By review of the cystoscopic findings and video hard copies, three independent observers classified the healed prostatic apertures with great uniformity into one of four categories: (I) minimal change (lateral lobes still meet in midline throughout gland length) (N = 3); (II) minor aperture (opening less than 50% of cystoscopic field over less than 50% of gland length) (N = 5); (III) major aperture (opening more than 50% of cystoscopic field over more than 50% of gland length) (N = 11); and (IV) full ablation (nearly complete replacement of lobar configuration with a general concavity) (N = 5). Clinical outcomes (symptom scores, uroflow rates) matched with follow-up cystoscopic categories but not with any other readily identifiable measures. The four-category system proved to be simple, reproducible, and clinically relevant. If a standardized tissue aperture is the ultimate aim of new methods to ablate the prostate, the proposed system for classifying the aperture could have a considerable future application.",Immunology
7543274,"Renal allograft rejection in children and young adults: the Banff classification. In the Banff classification, arteritis and tubulitis are regarded as the principal histological lesions indicating acute renal allograft rejection. To test this claim, we examined 51 biopsies obtained from 21 children and young adults with transplant rejection. Two reviewers, blind to the clinical course, graded the biopsies according to the Banff scheme. In patients without significant tubulitis (borderline changes), rejection tended to be reversed easily (88%), often with methylprednisolone pulse (52%). In patients with arteritis or significant tubulitis (Banff I-III), rejection was reversed in only 23% (P < 0.001), in 9% with steroids, and in 14% with OKT3. Salvage of the graft was achieved in 26 of 35 (74%) with a score < 5 but in only 1 of 12 (8%) with a score > or = 5 (P < 0.001). All 6 patients with vasculitis lost their grafts despite methylprednisolone pulse and OKT3. We conclude that the Banff classification predicts accurately the outcome of renal allograft rejection in children and may aid in choosing appropriate therapy.",Immunology
7543048,"Distinct tissue distribution in pigs of tenascin-X and tenascin-C transcripts. Tenascin-X and tenascin-C glycoproteins are phylogenetically conserved components of the extracellular matrix, although their specific roles remain to be determined. cDNA probes were produced from pig tenascin-X and tenascin-C genes and were used to examine the tissue distribution of the transcripts in 28 tissues from Large-White pigs, 4.5-42-months old (called adults) and 17 tissues from 87-day-old fetuses. The hybridization of Northern blots with tenascin-X probes revealed, in most tissues, a complex pattern of bands including a major band of about 13 kb, assumed to correspond to the main tenascin-X transcript. Hybridization with the tenascin-C probe showed two transcripts of 6.8 kb and 8.2 kb. The data from the ribonuclease-protection technique showed that both genes displayed large variations in the transcription levels among the tissues analysed. Overall, the tenascin-X gene was significantly expressed in two thirds of the tissues, and the tenascin-C gene in about 50% of them. The highest tenascin-X signals were observed in tendons, ligaments and, unexpectedly, in peripheral nerves. Other tissues, including colon, dermis, skin, heart, uterus, stomach, jejunum, placentae, aorta, lung, mammary and adrenal glands also exhibited significant signal intensities. In fetuses, mainly testes and skeletal muscle showed higher transcription levels than the adult counterparts. The tenascin-C gene was predominantly transcribed in the ligament, tendon, adrenal gland and colon, and more weakly in the stomach, jejunum, lung and spinal cord. In fetuses, the tenascin-C signal in the brain was higher than the signal in the brain of adult, whereas the reverse was true for the adrenal gland and the colon. Within a given tissue, the level of tenascin-X and tenascin-C transcripts varied greatly, indicating independent tenascin-X and tenascin-C transcription regulation mechanisms; this was particularly obvious in adult and fetal nerves but also in the dermis, skin, heart, uterus, placentae and aorta, where tenascin-X RNA molecules were much more abundant than those of tenascin-C. In addition, similar differences were observed in the skeletal muscle and adrenal gland of fetuses. In contrast, the amount of tenascin-C transcripts in the fetal brain and adult spinal cord was higher than those for tenascin-X. Our results draw attention to a possible specific role of tenascin-X in the peripheral nerve physiology.",Immunology
7542968,"Urodynamics and laser prostatectomy. A total of 81 patients with symptomatic bladder-outlet obstruction (BOO) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) underwent visual laser ablation of the prostate (VLAP) using a right-angled firing neodynium: YAG laser. The mean pre-operative prostatic volume was 48.5 ml. All patients were discharged on the 1st post-operative day with an indwelling catheter. Two patients underwent a transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) after failing a trial without catheter on two occasions. Of the remaining 79 patients, 75 were evaluated 6 months post-operatively. Mean symptom scores (I-PSS) decreased from 20.9 to 5.8, the mean maximal urinary flow rate increased from 7.9 to 16.4 ml/s and the mean residual volume decreased from 88.1 to 15.6 ml. Several different methods of evaluating BOO from pressure-flow measurements were used and all showed improvement. All the above-mentioned parameters showed a highly significant improvement (P < 0.01) at 6 months.",Immunology
7542605,"Selective killing of T cells by immunotoxins directed at distinct V beta epitopes of the T cell receptor. The potency and specificity of anti-T cell receptor (TcR)-directed immunotoxins were studied in two T cell leukemia lines, HPB-ALL and Jurkat, and in primary T cells. Immunoconjugates were synthesized using anti-CD3, or distinct anti-V beta antibodies cross-linked to CRM9, a binding site-mutant of diphtheria toxin. All TcR-expressing cells display the CD3 complex on the plasma membrane. HPB-ALL cells express the V beta 5 gene product in the beta subunit of the TcR, while Jurkat cells express V beta 8. V beta expression in primary T cells isolated from buffy coats is heterogeneous. Primary T cell populations expressing specific V beta epitopes in the TcR were generated by plating CD3+ T cells on V beta-specific antibody-coated flasks or by positive immunomagnetic selection. Immunotoxins directed against the invariant CD3 epsilon epitope target and kill all T cells. Immunoconjugates targeted at distinct anti-V beta epitopes are specific for cells that express the corresponding gene product in the TcR. The results demonstrate the ability of anti-TcR-based immunotoxins selectively to kill T cells with defined V beta epitopes. These reagents may be clinically useful in disorders mediated by autoreactive T cell populations exhibiting V beta restriction and in the treatment of clonal TcR-expressing lymphomas.",Immunology
7542348,"Structural changes in base-paired region 28 in 16 S rRNA close to the decoding region of the 30 S ribosomal subunit are correlated to changes in tRNA binding. Escherichia coli 30 S ribosomal subunits undergo a reversible change under low monovalent or divalent cation concentration and become inactive in tRNA binding and 50 S subunit association. In the inactive form, 16 S rRNA base-pairs (921-922).(1395-1396) and (923-925).(1391-1393), which are part of region 28, are unstable and an alternate arrangement, (921-923).(1532-1534), is detected by psoralen photochemical crosslinking. Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to investigate whether changes in base-paired region 28 or the alternate secondary structure is responsible for the inactivity of the subunit. 30 S subunits with the substitution C1533A or with deletion of nucleotides 1534 to 1542 can still be inactivated like the wild-type 30 S subunit. On the other hand, 30 S subunits that contain sequence changes in the 920 to 926 region show moderate to severe decreases in tRNA binding even under activating conditions. When 30 S subunits containing these mutations were subjected to chemical probing, they failed to show the normal hyper-reactivity of nucleotide G926 and, instead, reactivity was shifted to G925 or to G928, and G929. Two mutations in the 920 region result in structures in which A1394 is base-paired rather than being unpaired as normal; deletion but not substitution of A1394 resulted in loss of tRNA binding activity and depression of the reactivity of G926. Mutations were made to insert or delete a nucleotide at position 920. The deletion mutant but not the insertion mutant has decreased tRNA binding activity and also low reactivity of G926. We conclude that structural changes in region 28 account for the active/inactive difference in tRNA binding. Molecular models of region 28 were made using the program MC-SYM. Models that include a hydrogen bond interaction between A1394 and G1392 account for the G926 reactivity in the wild-type sequence and account for the effects of most of the mutations in changing the G926 reactivity.",Immunology
7542324,"Identification by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of an adduct between pure pig plasma benzylamine oxidase and the inhibitor 3,5-diethoxy-4-aminomethylpyridine. 3,5-Diethoxy-4-aminomethylpyridine (B24) interacts with pure pig plasma benzylamine oxidase (BAO), giving a Schiff base with the carbonyl active site. This Schiff base was reduced, isolated by chemical hydrolysis of the enzyme, purified by HPLC and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after derivatization. The isolated B24 adduct had the same absorption spectrum, retention time on HPLC and GC and the same mass spectrum as B24-pyridoxamine. B24, which is a reversible enzyme inhibitor, is also a weak substrate and competes with benzylamine, which is the best substrate, for the active site. These results further indicate the presence of pyridoxal-phosphate covalently linked to the pig plasma benzylamine oxidase and involved in the active site of this enzyme.",Immunology
7542313,"Increased nitric oxide synthase activities and L-[3H]arginine uptake in brain following portacaval anastomosis. Glutamatergic synaptic dysfunction has been proposed as a causal factor in portal-systemic encephalopathy. Increased in vitro and in vivo glutamate release and decreased glutamate binding to NMDA receptors were previously reported in the brains of portacaval-shunted rats. Such changes could lead to alterations in the second messenger systems coupled to glutamate receptors. As NMDA receptors have been shown to act via the nitric oxide/cyclic GMP second messenger system, we studied the activities of constitutive nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the brains of rats following portacaval shunting. Results demonstrate that NOS activities are significantly increased in cerebellum (by 54%, p < 0.01), cerebral cortex (by 65%, p < 0.01), hippocampus (by 88%, p < 0.01), and striatum (by 64%, p < 0.01) of shunted rats compared with sham-operated controls. As L-arginine transport is a prerequisite for nitric oxide production, we also studied L-[3H]arginine transport into cerebellar and cerebral cortical synaptosomes prepared from the brains of portacaval-shunted and sham-operated rats. L-[3H]Arginine uptake was significantly increased (by approximately 50%, p < 0.01) in both cerebellum and cortex. Increased NOS activities of neuronal and/or astrocytic origin and the resultant increased production of nitric oxide in brain could be the consequence of increased NMDA receptor activation following portacaval shunting. Furthermore, increased nitric oxide production could contribute to the increased cerebral blood flow consistently observed following portacaval shunting.",Immunology
7542229,"Clinical and retrospective evaluation of Eviprostat: a non-hormonal and non-neuropharmacological agent for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Eviprostat has been used as a non-hormonal and non-neuropharmacological treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in Japan. We evaluated the clinical efficacy of Eviprostat in patients with symptomatic BPH and the anti-inflammatory effect of this drug was investigated by retrospective evaluation of TUR specimens. Clinically, Eviprostat subjectively relieved obstructive symptoms of BPH. Objective improvements were also demonstrated by ultrasonographic evaluation of prostatic volume and urinary flow rates. Histologically, preoperative administration of Eviprostat improved the degree of prostatic inflammation. This drug probably can have a place in the treatment of patients with mild or moderate symptoms of outflow obstruction.",Immunology
7542129,"Fusaric acid in Fusarium moniliforme cultures, corn, and feeds toxic to livestock and the neurochemical effects in the brain and pineal gland of rats. Fusaric acid is produced by several species of Fusarium, which commonly infect corn and other agricultural commodities. Since this mycotoxin may augment the effects of other Fusarium toxins, a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method of analysis in feeds was developed. Fusaric acid was analyzed as the trimethylsilyl-ester from F. moniliforme-cultures, -contaminated corn screenings, and feeds toxic to livestock. The mycotoxin was found in all samples and ranged from 0.43 to 12.39 micrograms/g sample. Also, fusaric acid was tested for its neurochemical effects in the brain and pineal gland of rats. Animals were dosed intraperitoneally (100 mg/kg body weight) 30 min prior to the onset of the dark phase (lights out) and the effects were studied at 1.5, 3.5, and 5.5 h after treatment. Brain serotonin (5HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA), tyrosine (TYRO), and dopamine (DA) were increased (P < 0.05) by fusaric acid, and norepinephrine (NEpi) was decreased (P < 0.05). Analogously, DA in the pineal gland increased and NEpi decreased (P < 0.05). Pineal N-acetylserotonin (NAc5HT) was increased (P < 0.05), whereas pineal 5HT and its two major metabolites 5HIAA and 5-hydroxytryptophol (5HTOL) decreased (P < 0.05). Elevated brain TYRO and brain and pineal DA, with decreased NEpi, may be consistent with fusaric acid's partial inhibitory effect on tyrosine-hydroxylase and its inhibitory effect on dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, respectively. Elevated pineal Nac5HT is consistent with decreased pineal 5HT and the increased pineal DA, and support the dopaminergic stimulatory activity of the enzyme responsible for the conversion of 5HT to NAc5HT. This is the first report of fusaric acid's in vivo effect on pineal DA, NEpi, 5HT, and NAc5HT in rats, and a relation for the effects on TYRO, 5HT, and 5HIAA in brain tissue. The results indicate fusaric acid alters brain and pineal neurotransmitters and may contribute to the toxic effects of Fusarium-contaminated feeds.",Immunology

7541480,"[Vitronectin in children with renal disease--1. Immunofluorescence study of vitronectin and C5b-9 in childhood IgA nephropathy]. Renal biopsy specimens from 54 children (33 boys, 21 girls) with IgA nephropathy were investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy to determine the localization of vitronectin and C5b-9. vitronectin and C5b-9 deposits were found within the glomeruli of all cases and the intensity of vitronectin and C5b-9 deposits was as follows: vitronectin: (3+) 17 cases, (2+) 21 cases, (1+) 16 cases and C5b-9: (3+) 28 cases, (2+) 18 cases, (1+) 8 cases. In 19 cases and C5b-9 deposits were shown to be more predominant than vitronectin (Group C) and the same or less intense in 35 cases (Group V). In 33 cases, vitronectin deposits were demonstrated in the mesangial area only (M type), while in 21 cases deposits were presented both the mesangial area and the capillary wall (MC type). Linear staining of vitronectin was noted in Bowman's basement membrane and in the tubular basement membrane. Granular staining of vitronectin was observed in Bowman's basement membrane (29 cases) and tubular basement membrane (46 cases). M type C5b-9 deposits were demonstrated in 34 cases and MC type in 20 cases. C5b-9 deposits were observed in Bowman's basement membrane (19 cases) and in tubular basement membrane (37 cases). Intensely stained vitronectin was found in the sclerotic glomeruli and segmental sclerotic portion of the tissues. In serial biopsy, the intensity of both vitronectin and C5b-9 deposits became less intense. It was found that many patients of Group C had heavy proteinuria (P < 0.05) and that nephrotic patients were more frequent in Group C than in Group V (p < 0.05). In the light microscopic examination, most cases with intense C5b-9 deposits had mesangial proliferation (p < 0.10) and an increase in mesangial matrix (p < 0.10). Mesangial sclerosis index was correlated with the intensity of vitronectin deposits (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that vitronectin and the terminal complement system may play a critical role as a mediator of immunological tissue injury, especially mesangial sclerotic lesion in childhood IgA nephropathy.",Immunology

7541335,"Lenograstim. A review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic efficacy in neutropenia and related clinical settings. Lenograstim is a recombinant glycosylated human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rHuG-CSF) which principally regulates the formation and function of neutrophils. Like other colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), lenograstim has been developed for the prevention and treatment of iatrogenic and disease-related neutropenic conditions. In phase III clinical studies, prophylactic administration of lenograstim shortened the duration of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in patients with nonmyelogenous cancers who received standard-dose chemotherapy or myeloablative regimens followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT). A decrease in the incidence of infection after standard regimens and fewer days with infectious and febrile neutropenic episodes during recovery from BMT occurred concomitantly with the amelioration of neutropenia. In each setting, the decrease in morbidity was associated with shorter hospitalisation times and reduced administration of parenteral antibacterial agents. As with another rHuG-CSF, filgrastim, bone pain (non-serious) was the most common adverse reaction to lenograstim therapy. This occurred in 13% of lenograstim recipients and 5% of placebo recipients treated for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia with standard regimens. Lenograstim may facilitate dose optimisation and permit limited dose intensification of standard chemotherapy. Furthermore, the drug, used alone or in combination with chemotherapy, is effective in mobilising peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) for subsequent reinfusion. The latter is a promising technique which may supplement or ultimately replace BMT for stem cell rescue after myeloablative chemotherapy. However, it has yet to be established whether the dose intensification achievable with lenograstim and/or stem cell rescue has a material effect on relapse-free and survival times. Preliminary data suggest that lenograstim is effective in increasing the neutrophil count in patients with severe chronic neutropenia (Kostmann's syndrome), as well as patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex with zidovudine-induced neutropenia. Thus, lenograstim, like other CSFs, is a valuable adjunct to cytotoxic chemotherapy for the treatment of nonmyelogenous cancers, including myeloablative regimens followed by stem cell rescue with BMT and/or PBPC infusion. Future clinical experience is likely to confirm the usefulness of the drug in the management of disease-related neutropenia, myeloid disorders and neutropenia in patients with AIDS.",Immunology
7541310,"Comparison of hydromorphone and meperidine for ureteral colic. To compare the efficacies of meperidine and hydromorphone in the treatment for ureteral colic in the emergency department (ED). A prospective, double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted over six months at a tertiary referral center with 93,000 annual ED visits. Seventy-three patients completed the study. The patients received either 1 mg of hydromorphone or 50 mg of meperidine IV at t = 0. Pain intensity was determined using a 10-cm visual analog scale at t = 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes. A second dose of the study drug could be given between t = 15 and t = 120 minutes when the clinician believed the initial dose was ineffective. Patients requiring more than one additional dose of analgesia were treated as nonresponders and were removed from the study. Thirty-six patients received hydromorphone and 37 received meperidine. The initial pain intensities (hydromorphone group = 8.4 +/- 1.5; meperidine group = 8.5 +/- 2.1), age distributions, sex distributions, and side effects of the two groups were comparable. Pain relief was better (p < 0.05) with hydromorphone at t = 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes. The hydromorphone group required rescue analgesia less often (31% vs 68%, p < 0.01), had fewer IV pyelographies (IVPs) (28% vs 54%, p < 0.05), and had a lower proportion of hospital admissions (25% vs 49%, p = 0.08). For the fixed doses used in this study, the adult ureteral colic patients receiving hydromorphone achieved more pain relief, required less rescue medication, underwent fewer IVPs, and avoided hospital admission more frequently than did those receiving meperidine.",Immunology

7541235,"Intensification of chemotherapy for the treatment of solid tumours: feasibility of a 3-fold increase in dose intensity with peripheral blood progenitor cells and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Dose intensity may be an important determinant of the outcome in cancer chemotherapy, but is often limited by cumulative haematological toxicity. The availability of haematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and of peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation has allowed the development of a new treatment strategy in which several courses of high-dose combination chemotherapy are administered for the treatment of solid tumours. PBPCs were mobilised before chemotherapy using 12 or 30 micrograms kg-1 day-1 G-CSF (Filgrastim) for 10 days, and were collected by 2-5 leucaphereses. The yields of mononuclear cells, colony-forming units and CD34-positive cells were similar at the two dose levels of Filgrastim, and the numbers of PBPCs were sufficient for rescue following multiple cycles of chemotherapy. High-dose chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 2.5 g m-2 for 2 days, etoposide 300 mg m-2 for 3 days and cisplatin 50 mg m-2 for 3 days) was administered sequentially for a median of three cycles (range 1-4) to ten patients. Following the 30 evaluable cycles, the median duration of leucopenia < or = 0.5 x 10(9) l-1 and < or = 1.0 x 10(9) l-1 was 7 and 8 days respectively. The median time of thrombopenia < or = 20 x 10(9) l-1 was 6 days. There was no cumulative haematological toxicity. The duration of leucopenia, but not of thrombopenia, was inversely related to the number of reinfused CFU-GM (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units). In the majority of patients, neurotoxicity and ototoxicity became dose limiting after three cycles of therapy. However, the average dose intensity delivered was about three times higher than in a standard regimen. The complete response rate in patients with small-cell lung cancers was 66% (95% CI 30-92%) and the median progression-free survival and overall survival were 13 months and 17 months respectively. These results are encouraging and should be compared, in a randomised fashion, with standard dose chemotherapy.",Immunology
7541220,"Expression of immunoreactive and bioactive activin A protein in adult murine lung after bleomycin treatment. Activin A is a homodimeric protein structurally and functionally related to transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), and the expression of activin A is modulated by TGF-beta. Here, we demonstrate the expression of activin A in normal and bleomycin (BLM)-treated murine lungs. ICR mice were treated with BLM intraperitoneally for 10 days, whereas saline vehicle was injected into control mice. Intra-alveolar fibrotic changes were observed in the lung tissue obtained from the mice at day 14 after the final BLM administration. Immunohistochemical studies using a polyclonal antibody to activin A revealed the presence of activin A in the bronchiolar epithelium and smooth muscle cells of veins in both control and BLM-treated mice. In the BLM-treated mice at days 7 and 14, the marked infiltration of immunoreactive alveolar macrophages was observed in the area of fibrotic changes. Bioactivity of activin A measured by erythroid differentiation factor assay in the conditioned medium of alveolar macrophages obtained from BLM-treated mice at day 14 was significantly increased. These findings indicate that alveolar macrophages are a potent source of activin A after BLM treatment. The present study demonstrates for the first time the abundant expression of activin A in murine lung tissues after BLM administration, suggesting that activin A may play a role in the pathogenesis of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis.",Immunology
7541200,"Sensitivity/resistance profile of a simian immunodeficiency virus containing the reverse transcriptase gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) toward the HIV-1-specific non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. To develop an animal model for the therapy of AIDS with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors, we recently constructed a hybrid simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/HIV-1 in which the RT gene of SIV was replaced by the RT gene of HIV-1. This chimaeric virus, designated RT-SHIV, was found to be markedly sensitive to the inhibitory effects of both nucleoside (ddN) and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs). In contrast, SIV was inhibited only by ddNs (i.e., 3TC and AZT), but not NNRTIs. When RT-SHIV was grown in the presence of 3TC, nevirapine, TSAO-m3T or the thiocarboxanilide UC-42 drug-resistant mutant virus strains emerged in cell culture as rapid as for HIV-1(IIIB). The antiviral sensitivity/resistance spectrum of the mutant RT-SHIV strains against NNRTIs and ddNs, and the nature of the mutations that appeared in their RT were similar to those of the mutant HIV-1 strains that were selected under identical experimental conditions. Infection of macaques with RT-SHIV may be a useful tool for studying the mechanism of NNRTI-resistance development and the therapy of NNRTI-resistant viruses in an animal model.",Immunology
7541098,"Impairment of intracellular antiviral defense with age: age-dependent changes in expression of interferon-induced and double-stranded RNA-activated 2-5A synthetase in rat. The 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A) system is involved in the defense of mammalian cells against virus infection. In a previous study [25], we demonstrated that the activities of the enzymes which synthesize and degrade 2-5A [2-5A synthetase (2-5OAS) and 2',3'-exoribonuclease] and of the enzyme that is activated by 2-5A (ribonuclease L) change during aging and development in different tissues of rat. The age-dependent decrease in 2-5OAS activity and increase in 2-5A nuclease activity results in a decrease in the cellular 2-5A content, suggesting that the efficiency of the antiviral 2-5A system is impaired in aged rats. Here we determined the age-dependent changes in the level of mRNA coding for the class I isoenzyme of 2-5OAS (M(r) 40-46 kDa) in rat liver and brain using a cDNA which was recently cloned from rat hippocampus. We found that the decrease in 2-5OAS activity is accompanied by a decrease in the level of 2-5OAS mRNA; in old animals (32-33 months old), the amount of 2-5OAS mRNA was reduced to 20-30% compared to young adult (2-3 months old) (100%) and middle-aged adult animals (12 months old) (110-120%). In addition, Western-blotting experiments revealed that the amount of class I 2-5OAS capable of binding to its activator, poly(I).poly(C), is also diminished in the livers and brains of old rats compared to those of young adult and middle-aged adult animals.",Immunology
7541043,"Expression of a constitutive mutant of iron regulatory protein 1 abolishes iron homeostasis in mammalian cells. Iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) are iron-sensing proteins that bind to RNA stem-loop sequences known as iron-responsive elements (IREs) when cells are depleted of iron. Although IRPs have been shown to bind to IREs derived from ferritin and transferrin receptor (TfR) mRNAs in vitro, there has not been a direct demonstration of the impact of a recombinant IRP on the expression of endogenous IRE-containing transcripts. In this study, we evaluate the impact of expression of C437S, a mutant of IRP1 that binds IREs regardless of cellular iron status, on the regulation of biosynthesis of ferritin and TfR. Despite being made iron-replete, cells expressing C437S continue to synthesize and express high amounts of TfR, while the synthesis of ferritin is repressed. Thus, a single mutant IRP can prevent the usual homeostatic changes in ferritin and TfR biosynthesis. Cells expressing the mutant protein would therefore be predicted to be unable to defend against iron overload. Preliminary results show that cells treated with iron have diminished cell survival when C437S is expressed, and we have thus created a tissue culture model system for the study of iron toxicity.",Immunology

7540430,"Cell volume measured by total internal reflection microfluorimetry: application to water and solute transport in cells transfected with water channel homologs. Total internal reflection (TIR) microfluorimetry was established as a method to measure continuously the volume of adherent cells and applied to measure membrane permeabilities in cells transfected with water channel homologs. Cytosol was labeled with the membrane-impermeant fluorophore calcein. Fluorescence was excited by the TIR evanescent field in a thin section of cytosol (approximately 150 nm) adjacent to the cell-substrate interface. Because cytosolic fluorophore number per cell remains constant, the TIR fluorescence signal should be inversely related to cell volume. For small volume changes in Sf-9 and LLC-PK1 cells, relative TIR fluorescence was nearly equal to inverse relative cell volume; deviations from the ideal were modeled theoretically. To measure plasma membrane osmotic water permeability, Pf, the time course of osmotically induced cell volume change was inferred from the TIR fluorescence signal. LLC-PK1 cells expressing the CHIP28 water channel had an HgCl2-sensitive, threefold increase in Pf compared to nontransfected cells (Pf = 0.0043 cm/s at 10 degrees C). Solute permeability was measured from the TIR fluorescence time course in response to solute gradients. Glycerol permeability in Sf-9 cells expressing the water channel homolog GLIP was (1.3 +/- 0.2) x 10(-5) cm/s (22 degrees C), greater than that of (0.36 +/- 0.04) x 10(-5) cm/s (n = 4, p < 0.05) for control cells, indicating functional expression of GLIP. Water and urea permeabilities were similar in GLIP-expressing and control cells. The TIR method should be applicable to the study of water and solute permeabilities and cell volume regulation in cells of arbitrary shape and size.",Immunology
7540281,"Effects of maternal protein malnutrition on fetal growth, plasma insulin-like growth factors, insulin-like growth factor binding proteins, and liver insulin-like growth factor gene expression in the rat. We examined the effects of maternal dietary protein restriction on fetal growth and expression of IGF-I and -II, and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP). We sought to dissociate the respective effects of maternal protein versus calorie restriction on growth indices and IGF synthesis by the neonates of protein-restricted dams. Pregnant Wistar rats (six to eight per group) fed a low (5%) protein diet throughout gestation had impaired body weight gain compared with controls fed a normal (20%) protein diet (by 45%, p < 0.001). Their serum and liver IGF-I concentrations and liver IGF-I mRNA concentrations were also reduced by 60, 80, and 50%, respectively. Serum IGFBP-3 was reduced by 60% in protein-restricted dams within 1 to 2 h after delivery (p < 0.001 versus controls), although IGFBP-1, -2, and -4 were not significantly affected by the dietary protein intake. In pups of protein-restricted dams, the mean body and liver weight at birth was 15-20% less than that observed in the progeny from normal protein-fed dams (p < 0.01). Their plasma and liver IGF-I concentrations were 30 and 60% lower, respectively, whereas liver IGF-I mRNA abundance was reduced by 50% (p < 0.01). In contrast, neonatal plasma IGF-II and liver IGF-II mRNA concentrations were not significantly affected by the maternal protein malnutrition. Also, the plasma levels of IGFBP were not altered in the growth-retarded pups. Maternal protein restriction did not affect fetal and placental growth, plasma and liver IGF-I levels, and liver IGF-I mRNA abundance in 20-d-old fetuses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology
7540139,"Phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis is involved in production of Ca(2+)-dependent currents, but not non-selective cation currents, by muscarine in chromaffin cells. Whether phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and a subsequent Ca2+ mobilization are responsible for muscarine-induced transient outward currents (IO) and non-selective cation currents (INS) in the guinea-pig chromaffin cell was investigated using the perforated patch method. IO, but not INS, failed to be reproduced in Ca(2+)-free solution and was markedly reduced by prior exposure to caffeine under Ca(2+)-free conditions or by addition to normal solution of cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), a Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor. Application of CPA in Ca(2+)-free solution, however, suppressed INS by about 50% in 73% of the cells tested. Bath application of 1.5 mM neomycin, a phospholipase C inhibitor, induced the time-dependent decline of IO with near abolition at 20 min or less, whereas it produced a time-independent decrease of INS and an inwardly rectifying K+ current. INS in the presence or absence of neomycin was well fitted to rectangular hyperbolas with the same ED50 of 2.17 microM, but with a 33% smaller maximum amplitude in the former, indicating a non-competitive inhibition by neomycin. We conclude that, while phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis mediates the production of IO, it does not mediate that of INS by muscarine.",Immunology
7540107,"Immunological responses in human papillomavirus 16 E6/E7-transgenic mice to E7 protein correlate with the presence of skin disease. The human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes, E6 and E7, are believed to contribute to the development of cervical cancers in women infected with certain HPV genotypes, most notably HPV-16 and HPV-18. Given their expression in tumor tissue, E6 and E7 have been implicated as potential tumor-specific antigens. We have examined an HPV-16 E6- and E7-transgenic mouse lineage for immune responses to these viral oncoproteins. Mice in this lineage express the HPV-16 E6 and E7 genes in their skin and eyes, and on aging, these mice frequently develop squamous cell carcinomas and lenticular tumors. Young transgenic mice, which had measurable E7 protein in the eye but not in the skin, were immunologically naive to E7 protein. They mounted an immune response to E7 on immunization comparable to that of nontransgenic controls, suggesting a lack of immune tolerance to this protein. Older line 19 mice, which are susceptible to skin disease associated with transcription of the E6 and E7 open reading frames, had measurable E7 protein in their skin. These older transgenic mice spontaneously developed antibody responses to endogenous E7 protein, particularly in association with skin disease. Also detected in older mice were delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to E7. These finding parallel the humoral immune response to E7 protein in patients with HPV-associated cervical cancer and suggest that line 19 mice may provide a model for studying the immunobiology of HPV-associated cancers.",Immunology

To evaluate the efficacy of aprotinin in reducing the need for blood products in orthotopic liver transplantation. Blood product needs and coagulation test results were studied in 42 adults with cirrhosis of the liver who received orthotopic liver transplants. The first 16 liver transplants carried out without aprotinin (control group) were compared with the next 26 consecutive transplant patients who received aprotinin. Each of the first 9 received a loading dose of 2 million units that was followed by the infusion of half a million units per hour until the end of surgery. The next 17 received the same infusion dose at the same rate but no loading dose. Patients who received aprotinin required fewer transfusions of blood products (5.3 units of packed red blood cells as opposed to 13 units; 9 units of fresh frozen plasma versus 14.6 units; 1.7 units of platelets versus 4.2 units; and 3.8 units of cryoprecipitates versus 8.8 units). We observed a marked reduction of fibrinolysis (less increase in D dimers after removal of the liver when aprotinin was used. Prophylactic use of aprotinin during surgery has a beneficial effect on hemostatic mechanisms, reducing the need for blood products. A reduction in fibrinolysis seems to contribute to this effect.",Immunology

GDP-L-fucose:beta-D-galactoside alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.69) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of fucosylated type 1 and 2 lactoseries structures, such as Lewis b and the H type 2 and Lewis Y, respectively, that are accumulated in colon adenocarcinoma. Analysis of the mRNA transcript level for the human H gene-encoded beta-D-galactoside alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferase revealed 40- and 340-fold increases in the mRNA levels in all adenocarcinomas and tumor cell lines, respectively, compared to normal colon mucosa where a low level of mRNA transcript was detected. A variable increase in mRNA transcript levels was observed in 50% of adenomatous polyps. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the protein coding region of the cDNAs derived from normal colon, adenoma, and colon adenocarcinoma revealed 100% homology, suggesting that there are no tumor-associated allelic variations within the H beta-D-galactoside alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferase cDNA. These results suggest that beta-D-galactoside alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferase expression highly correlates with malignant progression of colon adenocarcinoma.",Immunology
7539899,"Nitric oxide synthase-containing neurons in sensory ganglia of the rat are susceptible to capsaicin-induced cytotoxicity. Nitric oxide synthase in lumbar dorsal root ganglia of neonatal rat was studied by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase and in situ hybridization histochemistry. Induction of nitric oxide synthase in neonatal capsaicin-treated rats after sciatic axotomy was compared with the axotomy-induced nitric oxide synthase increase observed in vehicle-treated littermates. In neonatal capsaicin-treated animals, the number of neurons constitutively labeled by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase was greatly reduced as compared to vehicle-treated littermates. Nitric oxide synthase messenger RNA was not readily identified constitutively in dorsal root ganglion neurons. Seven days after sciatic transection the induction of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase and nitric oxide synthase messenger RNA found in the vehicle-treated group was not observed in the capsaicin group. The presence of nitric oxide synthase in dorsal root ganglion neurons thus does not appear to protect against Ca(2+)-mediated capsaicin-induced cytotoxicity. However, since some nitric oxide synthase dorsal root ganglion neurons persist after the capsaicin neurotoxicity, nitric oxide synthase expression must occur in a neurochemically diverse subpopulation of small (< 1000 microns2) neurons. The capsaicin sensitivity of most nitric oxide synthase dorsal root ganglion neurons indicates that they have unmyelinated axons and are likely to be involved in nociception.",Immunology

Asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias in patients with congestive heart failure are associated with increased rates of overall mortality and sudden death. Amiodarone is now used widely to prevent ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. We conducted a trial to determine whether amiodarone can reduce overall mortality in patients with congestive heart failure and asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias. We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol in which 674 patients with symptoms of congestive heart failure, cardiac enlargement, 10 or more premature ventricular contractions per hour, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40 percent or less were randomly assigned to receive amiodarone (336 patients) or placebo (338 patients). The primary end point was overall mortality, and the median follow-up was 45 months (range, 0 to 54). There was no significant difference in overall mortality between the two treatment groups (P = 0.6). The two-year actuarial survival rate was 69.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 64.2 to 74.6) for the patients in the amiodarone group and 70.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 65.7 to 75.9) for those in the placebo group. At two years, the rate of sudden death was 15 percent in the amiodarone group and 19 percent in the placebo group (P = 0.43). There was a trend toward a reduction in overall mortality among the patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy who received amiodarone (P = 0.07). Amiodarone was significantly more effective in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias and increased the left ventricular ejection fraction by 42 percent at two years. Although amiodarone was effective in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias and improving ventricular function, it did not reduce the incidence of sudden death or prolong survival among patients with heart failure, except for a trend toward reduced mortality among those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.",Immunology

Human platelets suspended in plasma or buffer were incubated with low concentrations of the nitric oxide (NO)-donor 3-morpholino-syndnonime (SIN-1; 100 nM to 1 microM) and the stable prostacyclin analogue iloprost (50 or 100 pM) and analyzed for cyclic nucleotide levels and protein phosphorylation. SIN-1 and iloprost synergistically stimulated the phosphorylation of rap1B and the 50 kDa vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein. SIN-1 stimulated platelet cyclic GMP and cAMP-levels and enhanced the increase in cyclic AMP elicited by iloprost. It was found that the mechanism underlying the synergistic phosphorylation of the 50 kDa protein and rap1B was different: synergistic phosphorylation of the 50 kDa protein seemed to be mediated by activation of both protein kinases A and G, whereas the synergistic rap1B phosphorylation could be attributed entirely to activation of protein kinase A. Measurement of rap1B phosphorylation might be a useful tool to monitor the action of systemically applied prostacyclin-analogues and nitrovasodilators in pharmacological studies.",Immunology

Critical pathways reduce variations in clinical management and achieve quality patient outcomes within a defined time while reducing the average length of stay (ALOS). The critical path is a day-by-day plan that specifies the use and timing of procedures in relation to the stage in the patient's recovery. Variations from that plan are identified and aggressively approached. This article outlines the clinical nurse coordinator's role in utilizing critical pathways for the congenital heart surgery patients. Successful implementation of the pathways using the clinical nurse coordinator's role is supported by analysis of ALOS in 286 patients.,Immunology
7539521,"Microbial mutagenic effects of the DNA minor groove binder pibenzimol (Hoechst 33258) and a series of mustard analogues. A series of aniline mustards and half-mustards targeted to DNA by linkage (through a polymethylene chain) to the bisbenzimidazole chromophore of pibenzimol (Hoechst 33258) have been evaluated for their mutagenic properties, as estimated in three strains of Salmonella typhimurium, and for their mitotic crossing-over and petite mutagenesis activities in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain D5. Agarose gel electrophoresis studies showed that only the derivative with the longest linker chain cross-linked DNA, with the remaining compounds being monoalkylators. The parent (non-alkylator) minor groove binding ligand (Hoechst 33258) was inactive in the bacterial strains TA98 or TA100 but weakly mutagenic in TA102, and caused neither mitotic crossing-over nor 'petite' mutagenesis in yeast. Aniline half-mustard itself (monoalkylator) was an effective base-pair substitution mutagen (events in S. typhimurium strain TA100) with some frameshift mutagenesis activity in TA98, but showed only weak effects in the yeast assays, whereas aniline mustard (cross-linker) was inactive in these bacterial systems but caused substantial amounts of mitotic crossing-over in yeast. The composite molecules studied here showed effects more characteristic of the minor groove binding chromophore than of alkylating moieties. All showed weak mutagenic activity in TA102 and none in TA98. The only compound to show significant mitotic crossing-over ability was the long-chain derivative which cross-linked DNA. For most of the compounds, the mutagenicity data provided no supportive evidence for DNA alkylation. Since other evidence suggests this does occur readily, it is likely to have a different target to that seen with untargeted aniline mustards. The significant antitumor activity and low mutagenic potential shown by these compounds make them worthy of further study.",Immunology

The neutralizing epitopes of the major outer surface proteins A and B (OspA and OspB) of Borrelia burgdorferi B31 were investigated by epitope mapping using overlapping synthetic peptides, encompassing full-length OspA and OspB, and antiborrelial monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). OspA MAb N4B12 and OspB MAbs N5G5, W7C2, and P4D1 displayed a complement-independent antiborrelial activity, and complement failed to enhance the antiborrelial activity, as measured by a sensitive colorimetric assay. A combination of N4B12 with N5G5 displayed a higher antiborrelial activity than did the MAbs individually. OspA MAbs B3G11 and L3B5, however, exhibited a significant antiborrelial activity only in the presence of complement. Epitope mapping showed that B3G11 bound to one OspA synthetic peptide with the sequence of amino acids 247 to 256 (QYDSNGTKLE) and produced more than sixfold-higher reactivity than with other sequences, as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. OspB MAb N5G5 bound to an OspB peptide with the sequence of amino acids 211 to 220 (TLKREIEKDG), yielding at least threefold-higher reactivity than with other sequences. These two peptide sequences were found to contain neutralizing epitopes. Other MAbs had weak binding activities with the synthetic peptides, and their specific epitopes remain to be further analyzed. Thus, this study demonstrated both complement-independent and complement-dependent antiborrelial MAbs and identified the linear epitopes on OspA and OspB capable of inducing neutralizing antibody responses.",Immunology

RNA isolated at intervals during fermentation from the novobiocin-producing wild-type strain of Streptomyces niveus and from a series of novobiocin-non-producing (Nov-) mutants was hybridized to DNA probes containing sequences which specify novobiocin resistance. The probes were made from inserts contained in the clones pGL101 and pGL103 which increase the level of novobiocin resistance of S. lividans transformants from 10 micrograms ml-1 to 50 micrograms ml-1 and 150 micrograms ml-1, respectively. No hybridization was detected with the pGL101 probe. The pGL103 probe hybridized to RNA extracted during the later stages of growth--a pattern corresponding to the transition from low to high level novobiocin resistance during growth of S. niveus wild-type cultures. Neither probe hybridized to RNA extracted from four Nov- mutants. These mutants showed variable levels of novobiocin resistance but none expressed the high wild-type levels. The authors conclude that expression of the DNA sequence in pGL103 is associated with high level novobiocin resistance.",Immunology

The purpose of this study was to describe the social context in which the process of critical care clinical judgment occurs from the nurse's perspective. An ethnographic study was conducted that included interviews with 10 nurses and participant observation in an open heart surgery unit with 59 nurses and two surgical teams during a 2-year period. Nurses and physicians were organized in hierarchies of nurse manager, resource nurse, charge nurse, and staff nurse or attending surgeon, fellow, chief resident, and resident. These parallel hierarchies allowed for checks on judgment both within and across professional lines. Rituals, such as nursing report, physician rounds, and flow sheet use, provided a context for a critique on judgment processes. Communication of judgment was frequently a casual, open conversation. At other times, differences in perspective could result in conflict. Communication between nurses and physicians has been associated with better patient outcomes. Critical care unit directors and managers can use an analysis of communication patterns to develop supports to clinical judgment.",Immunology
7537100,"Effect of a chemical or proteolytic modification on the biological activity of guinea-pig cationic peptide. Guinea-pig neutrophil cationic peptides (GNCPs) are single polypeptides containing 31 amino acid residues and three intramolecular disulfide bonds, which show both antibacterial and histamine-releasing activities. Reduction and alkylation of the disulfide bonds of GNCP did not reduce both biological activities. When pyridylethylated GNCP was digested with trypsin, the biological activities were almost lost, whereas the chymotryptic digest retained the biological activities. Chymotrypsin digested fragments were purified by RP-HPLC, and three active peptide fragments containing two Arg residues at the N-terminal sequence were isolated. When the biological activities were examined using synthetic peptides containing various numbers of Arg residue at the N-terminus, the omission of the Arg residues was found to reduce remarkably the antibacterial and histamine-releasing activities. Together these observations indicate that the primary structures containing Arg residues at the N-terminus but not the intramolecular disulfide cross-linking are important for the expression of the biological activities of GNCP.",Immunology

The aims of this study were to investigate the role of cytokines (tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interferon gamma (IFN gamma) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) in augmenting graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL). We have investigated the effector cells involved in GVL, by studying the role of these cells in purging of the cell line K562 in short-term bone marrow cultures. The effect of the addition in vitro of rGCSF was also studied. Monitoring of purging was achieved by cytotoxicity assays, DNA analysis and the use of the polymerase chain reaction for the detection of bcr/abl transcripts in the Philadelphia positive (Ph+) K562 cell line. Supernatants from IL-2-treated and non-treated bone marrow were tested for cytokine production (TNF alpha and IFN gamma). The results have shown that the main cytotoxic effector cells in the bone marrow generated by IL-2 have the CD56+ CD8+ phenotype. Overnight incubation of bone marrow was sufficient to generate cytotoxic cells as measured by Chromium51 (Cr51) release assays. Measurable levels of TNF alpha but not IFN gamma were also detected in supernatants. Addition of TNF alpha and IFN gamma to the IL-2 in the bone marrow cultures augmented the cytotoxicity but tended to inhibit progenitor cell growth as measured by granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (GM-CFU) and erythroid blast-forming unit (BFU-e) assays. An estimate of the purging of the marrow could also be achieved by DNA analysis of K562 DNA in bone marrow. The bcr/abl transcript could still be detected by PCR analysis in marrow containing 1% K562 and treated with IL-2 for 24 h, but by 6 days of incubation the bcr/abl transcript was weak or undectable. The results suggest that although reduction in the proportion of leukaemia in contaminated marrow can be detected after incubation with IL-2 for 24 h, complete elimination of minimal residual disease requires longer incubation times.",Immunology
7533711,"Mechanism-based comparisons of acute toxicities elicited by industrial organic chemicals in procaryotic and eucaryotic systems. Comparisons of toxicities elicited by nonpolar and polar narcotics, weak acid uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation, and bioreactive chemicals between the eucaryotic systems Pimephales promelas and Tetrahymena pyriformis and the procaryotic systems Escherichia coli and Photobacterium phosphoreum were performed. Each chemical had been a priori assigned a mechanism/mode of action based on the results from previous studies with eucaryotic systems. Hydrophobicity-dependent QSARs for nonpolar narcosis for both the E. coli and the P. phosphoreum endpoints was developed. However, due to the lack of a significant relationship between P. phosphoreum toxicity and log Kow, such a QSAR for polar narcosis was developed only for the E. coli endpoint. Except for 4-nitroaniline (the only chemical in the examined group that required activation to become the Michael receptor), all chemicals containing reactive substructures revealed excess toxicity over polar narcosis QSAR for E. coli endpoints. Moreover, chloroacidic acid and ethyl chloroacetate in this system also appear to be bioreactive. The only mechanism that seemed to not exist in the procaryotic system was uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Chemicals from this group, except 2,4-dinitroaniline, did not exhibit excess toxicity over polar narcosis QSAR. This was thought to be explained by the lack of mitochondria in procaryotes, the target site of uncoupling agents in eucaryotes. In addition, evaluation of toxicities of halogen-substituted short-chain carboxylic alcohols indicated that their mechanisms vary, depending upon the type of substitution and the system.",Immunology

Bioconcentration models were used in order to test the equilibrium condition between biotic and abiotic compartments. The oligochaetes-sediment model fitted very well with the experimental results. The only exception was hexachlorobenzene. The results regarding the fish species demonstrate that most PCB congeners and p,p'-DDE are biomagnificated in the River Po ecosystem but to a lesser extent than expected on the basis of a four-step food chain model.

7531836,"Antigen immunohistochemistry of renal cell adenomas in autopsy cases: relevance to histogenesis. Eighty-three kidneys from autopsy cases, all more than 60 years of age, were used in the present studies. Three millimeter-thick step slices from all kidneys were embedded in paraffin, and serial sections from all blocks used for the immunohistochemical demonstration of Leu M1 (leukocyte membrane antigen) and LTA (Lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin) in cells of proximal convoluted tubular origin, and PNA (peanut agglutinin) and EMA (epithelial membrane antigen) in cells of distal convoluted tubular origin. The ABC staining method was used in all cases. A total of 65 renal cell adenomas found in 31 of the 83 kidneys consisted of 40 papillary, 20 tubular and 5 solid type lesions. The sizes of these renal cell adenomas were from 0.6 to 5 mm in diameter and compression of neighboring tissues was characteristic. Papillary renal cell adenomas were positive in their cytoplasms for Leu M1 and LTA in 7 cases and at their cell membranes for PNA and EMA in 33 cases. The respective figures for tubular renal cell adenomas were 6 cases for Leu M1 and LTA and 14 cases for PNA and EMA. All solid renal cell adenomas were positive in their cytoplasms for PNA and EMA. The immunohistochemical results thus indicated 13 of 65 lesions to have a proximal convoluted tubular cell origin and 52 to be possibly derived from distal convoluted tubules or collecting ducts. A role for metaplasia, however, could not be ruled out.",Immunology
7531808,"Detection of hydroquinone-induced nonrandom breakage in the centromeric heterochromatin of mouse bone marrow cells using multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization with the mouse major and minor satellite probes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with a mouse major satellite probe and CREST staining were used to characterize the origin of micronuclei occurring in mouse bone marrow erythrocytes following administration of the benzene metabolite hydroquinone. Hydroquinone was administered to male CD-1 mice by i.p. injection on three consecutive days and the bone marrow cells were harvested 24 h later. A pronounced difference in the results was observed using the two approaches: 63% of the micronuclei induced by hydroquinone labeled with the major satellite probe whereas only 28% labeled with the CREST antibody. To determine whether the observed difference was due to a disruption of the kinetochore or a result of breakage within centromeric heterochromatin, we developed a tandem label multicolor hybridization assay, which requires the presence of both the mouse major and minor satellite probes in a micronucleus for a classification of chromosomal loss. The minor probe targets a centromeric region physically linked to the short arm of mouse chromosomes, whereas the major probe hybridizes to the centromeric heterochromatin adjacent to the long arm. Using this approach, 29% of the micronuclei induced by hydroquinone hybridized with both the major and minor satellite probes, indicating chromosome loss; an additional 37% labeled with only the major satellite probe indicating breakage within the centromeric heterochromatin. Although the region targeted by the major satellite probe comprises only 5-10% of the mouse genome, these major-probe containing micronuclei represent 53% of the micronuclei formed as the result of chromosome breakage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology

Circular smooth muscle of the small intestine was highly responsive, large intestine circular smooth muscle less so, while longitudinal muscle from all gut segments was much less sensitive. pD2 values and intrinsic activities on small intestine circular muscle indicated differences in receptor distribution between the duodenum and ileum: NK3 and a smaller number of NK2 receptors being present in the duodenum, and NK2 receptors predominating in the ileum. Notwithstanding this, eledoisin and neurokinin B were the most active substances on duodenum and ileum, respectively.

7531777,"Gender-dependent differences in hepatic tumor promotion in diethylnitrosamine initiated infant B6C3F1 mice by alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane. Chronic exposure of B6C3F1 mice to phenobarbital (PB), subsequent to a single initiating dose of diethylnitrosamine (DENA) at 15 d of age, has been previously shown to inhibit hepatic tumorigenesis in male mice, while promoting hepatic tumor formation in female mice (Weghorst & Klaunig, 1989). In the present study, the effects of another hepatic tumor promoter, alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH), in similarly initiated B6C3F1 mice was investigated. Male and female mice received a single intraperitoneal (ip) injection of either DENA or saline at 15 d of age. Beginning at 28 d of age, the mice received either alpha-HCH in the diet (250 ppm) or untreated basal diet. Like PB, alpha-HCH inhibited hepatic tumorigenesis in male mice, while promoting hepatic tumor formation in female mice following chronic exposure. In an additional experiment, already formed preneoplastic hepatic foci in male and female B6C3F1 mice were examined for their responsiveness to the induction of DNA synthesis by alpha-HCH treatment. The mice received a single ip injection of DENA at 15 d of age to induce hepatocellular foci. Beginning at 24 wk of age, mice received either basal diet or diet containing 250 ppm alpha-HCH for 7 consecutive d. DNA synthesis was assessed by continuous [3H]thymidine infusion via subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps. In female mice treated with alpha-HCH, DNA synthesis in hepatocellular foci was increased substantially compared to untreated females. In contrast, male mice receiving alpha-HCH showed no increase in DNA synthesis in hepatocellular foci from that seen in non-alpha-HCH-treated males. Based on these results, we postulate that the gender-dependent differences in hepatic tumorigenesis observed in B6C3F1 mice initiated during infancy may be related to chemical tumor promoter modulation of the normal hormonal environment, or to differences in the ability of hepatocellular foci to respond to the induction of DNA synthesis by the tumor promoter.",Immunology
7529304,"Developmental regulation of the porcine exocrine pancreas by glucocorticoids. The possible role of cortisol in development of the exocrine pancreas was investigated. In the first study, fetal pigs were removed from the uterus by caesarean section (pentobarbitone anesthesia) and the pancreas collected from 51 69 to 109-day-old fetuses (term = 114 +/- 2 days). Of these, 15 88 to 90-day-old fetuses had been infused subcutaneously for 6 days with either saline, adrenocorticotropic hormone or cortisol (osmotic mini-pumps implanted at 82-84 days). The pancreas was also removed from eight newborn pigs. Quantitative enzyme analysis showed that amylase and trypsin activities per milligram pancreatic protein increased toward term, correlated positively with fetal plasma cortisol (p < 0.01) and were stimulated by cortisol infusion (p < 0.05). In the second study, pigs were delivered by caesarean section 2-3 days before term (to circumvent the neonatal cortisol surge) and injected intramuscularly with saline (n = 11), metyrapone (an inhibitor of cortisol synthesis, n = 12), adrenocorticotropic hormone (n = 14) or cortisol acetate (n = 6) during the postnatal period. At 6-7 days of age, adrenocorticotropic hormone- and cortisol acetate-treated pigs had higher concentrations of amylase and trypsin in pancreas than metyrapone-treated pigs. The values in saline-injected pigs were intermediate. By gel electrophoresis and subsequent incubation with enzyme substrates, protease E, chymotrypsin C, and cathodic trypsin were first detected at 6-7 days of age, and the activities (semiquantitative densitometry) appeared lower in metyrapone-treated pigs than in pigs from other treatment groups. The results indicate that glucocorticoids stimulate the perinatal development of pancreatic enzymes in the pig.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology

7529292,"Apoptosis abnormalities of splenic lymphocytes in autoimmune lpr and gld mice. The murine gene lpr encodes an aberrant form of the apoptosis-inducing receptor Fas. The gene gld, which causes an autoimmune syndrome phenotypically identical to that caused by lpr, encodes a mutant Fas ligand. Because the lpr gene must be expressed in both T and B cells to produce autoimmune disease, it might be anticipated that apoptosis abnormalities would be present in both. Therefore, we quantitated apoptosis in T and B cells from lpr, gld, and normal mice in a short-term in vitro culture system. Freshly isolated spleen cells from normal, lpr, or gld mice showed little or no apoptosis as assessed by quantitative DNA flow cytometry. However, after overnight culture, both T and B cells showed substantial spontaneous apoptosis. Such apoptosis increased strikingly with age in normal but not in autoimmune B cells. CD23low B cells, which are prominent in lpr and gld mice, were particularly notable for high levels of programmed cell death in normal mice. The apoptosis caused by the gld defect could not be corrected by coculture with normal spleen cells. The persistence with age of low levels of B cell apoptosis in lpr and gld mice presumably reflects deficient Fas/Fas ligand interactions. The further localization of the B cell apoptosis defect to the unusual CD23low B cells, which accumulate in lpr and gld mice, adds to the evidence that these cells may be of critical importance to autoimmunity.",Immunology
7529277,"Increased levels of the soluble adhesion molecule E-selectin in essential hypertension. To determine whether soluble E-selectin levels were raised in hypertension and whether such levels correlated with those of von Willebrand factor. Forty-five consecutive patients with uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg) and 33 consecutive patients with controlled hypertension (blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg, i.e. normotension) were examined and compared with 40 normotensive age- and sex-matched controls. Levels of von Willebrand factor and soluble E-selectin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in venous blood serum. Resting systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures were measured before venepuncture. Soluble E-selectin levels were raised in hypertension compared with controls and normotension. The levels of von Willebrand factor were raised in hypertension and normotension compared with controls. In multivariate analysis of all subjects, von Willebrand factor levels correlated with SBP (P < 0.001) and soluble E-selectin level correlated with DBP (P < 0.001), but levels of von Willebrand factor and soluble E-selectin did not correlate. There was no clear relationship between levels of either endothelial cell index or the class of drug therapy used or its dosage. We suggest that raised levels of soluble E-selectin in hypertension do not indicate endothelial cell injury but may be related to endothelial cell activation. The stimulus for release of soluble E-selectin might be different from that for von Willebrand factor.",Immunology
7528684,"Specific changes in the basement membrane of the proximal tubules in the murine polycystic kidney detected by the novel anti-basement membrane monoclonal antibody D28. In order to analyze renal abnormalities in mice with polycystic kidney disease (PKD), we produced a series of monoclonal antibodies reactive with the murine kidney by hybridizing P3U1 myeloma cells with spleen cells from DBA/2 mice immunized with the kidney of adult-type PKD mice, DBA/2FG-pcy. One clone, D28, reacted specifically with the basement membrane of the proximal tubules of DBA/2 mice and DBA/2FG-pcy mice. It did not react with other parts of the murine kidney nor with other tissues such as the skin, ovary, fallopian tube, testis, lung and small intestine. While other components such as collagen IV, laminin and the core protein of proteoglycan could be found, the D28 epitope could not be found in the basement membrane of renal cysts formed in adult-type (DBA/2FG-pcy) and infant-type (C57BL/6J-cpk) PKD mice. The D28 epitope did not, however, disappear from the basement membrane of proximal tubules in other types of renal abnormalities. These results suggest that the formation of renal cysts in the proximal tubules is associated with an alteration to the proximal tubule-specific structure of the basement membrane. The D28 monoclonal antibody should prove a useful tool with which to analyze basement membrane-associated abnormalities in genetic PKD.",Immunology
7528130,"Treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma. Current guidelines and future perspectives. Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common malignancy associated with HIV infection, and the morbidity and mortality attributable to AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (AIDS-KS) may be increasing. No curative therapy is available for AIDS-KS, but palliative therapy can eliminate or reduce cosmetically unacceptable lesions, reduce painful or unsightly oedema or lymphadenopathy, shrink symptomatic oral lesions and relieve symptoms caused by visceral involvement. Strategies currently employed to treat the various clinical problems encountered in AIDS-KS include single- and multi-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy, treatment with interferon-alpha, radiotherapy, and other local therapies. Current clinical research is focusing on use of liposome-encapsulated cytotoxic agents and treatment with substances that inhibit angiogenesis. Any treatment plan for AIDS-KS must be flexible and must be based on the patient's overall clinical and immunological status as well as therapeutic goals. Limited local disease is usually amenable to treatment with local measures. Extensive, symptomatic AIDS-KS warrants systemic treatment. The response of mucocutaneous lesions to low dose systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy is typically excellent. Treatment with interferon-alpha may also be beneficial in this setting. Multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimens are usually reserved for treatment of patients most severely affected by AIDS-KS. It is hoped that liposome-encapsulated cytotoxic chemotherapy and antiangiogenic therapies will prove more effective and less toxic than the treatment strategies currently in use.",Immunology

Cs+ and ChTX, a polypeptide toxin from the venom of the scorpion Leirus quinquestriatus, are considered blockers of Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels in several somatic cells. Both agents inhibited the AR by 55-66%. The inhibition was completely reversed by the Na+/K+ ionophore nigericin, but not by the Ca2+ ionophore A-23187.

7518441,"Cyclic RGD peptide inhibits alpha 4 beta 1 interaction with connecting segment 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule. The integrin supergene family includes receptors for a variety of extracellular matrix as well as cell surface proteins. Integrin alpha 4 has been shown to play an important role in leukocyte adhesion and extravasation during immune and inflammatory reactions. One recognition sequence known to interact with alpha 4 is the Leu-Asp-Val (LDV) site contained in the connecting segment 1 region of fibronectin. Here we present evidence that shows that a conformationally restricted RGD-containing peptide is a potent inhibitor of cell adhesion mediated by alpha 4 beta 1, a receptor not convincingly documented to interact with RGD peptides. This peptide, 1-adamantaneacetyl-Cys-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro-Cys (disulfide bridge between residues 1-8), blocks Jurkat cell adhesion to connecting segment 1-containing peptides as well as cell adhesion to cytokine-activated endothelial cells. Adhesion of Jurkat cells to either vascular cell adhesion molecule-expressing cells or recombinant vascular cell adhesion molecule-coated plates was likewise inhibited by this peptide. Furthermore, alpha 4 beta 1 can bind directly to a cyclic RGD peptide immobilized to Sepharose. Integrins, alpha 5 beta 1, alpha v beta 3, alpha IIb/beta IIIa, alpha 2 beta 1, alpha v beta 1, alpha v beta 5, alpha v beta 6, and alpha 3 beta 1, have been shown to recognize the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence present in a variety of extracellular matrix proteins, and our data support the addition of alpha 4 beta 1 to this group. Further studies using molecular modeling of such cyclic RGD peptides could help in the design of more potent peptides or nonpeptide mimetics that could effectively block alpha 4-mediated activity and have potential application in a number of inflammatory diseases.",Immunology
7515896,"Induction of human tenascin (neuronectin) by growth factors and cytokines: cell type-specific signals and signalling pathways. The extracellular matrix protein tenascin (TN) is expressed with precise temporo-spatial patterns during embryonic and fetal development and is induced in healing wounds, inflammatory lesions and solid tumors. These tissue patterns suggest that TN synthesis may be modulated by soluble factors present in developing tissues or released from injured, inflammatory or neoplastic cells. To characterize the extrinsic control of human TN we examined the effects of several signalling molecules on cultured neural, melanocytic and fibroblastic cells. Results obtained with alpha TN antibodies in enzyme-linked immunosorbent and immunoprecipitation assays indicate that TN expression is tightly regulated in a cell type-specific manner: (1) Primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) cells grown in chemically defined, serum-free media show up to > 100-fold TN induction in response to fibroblast growth factors (aFGF, bFGF, K-FGF) and phorbol ester, independent of changes in cell proliferation or total protein synthesis; no induction is seen in PNET cultures stimulated with serum or other growth and differentiation factors. (2) Normal melanocytes, which require FGF and phorbol ester for survival in vitro, fail to express TN; however, they produce TN following oncogenic transformation. (3) Fibroblasts derived from disparate tissues differ up to 100-fold in basal TN production; for example, fetal lung fibroblasts are TNhigh, but conjunctival fibroblasts derived from the same donors and fetal leptomeningeal cells are TNlow. (4) TNlow fibroblasts treated with interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-4 show up to > 100-fold increased TN secretion and TN incorporation into their extracellular matrix. Transforming growth factor-beta, which acts as an inducer of fibronectin, collagen, and integrin-type matrix receptors, has variable effects on fibroblast TN, ranging from increased deposition in the extracellular matrix of fetal conjunctival fibroblasts to reduced secretion in newborn foreskin fibroblasts. In contrast, FGFs (which are potent fibroblast mitogens), phorbol ester, bone morphogenetic proteins, and several other factors tested produced no discernible effects on fibroblast TN expression. These findings suggest that discrete sets of extrinsic signals modify TN expression in specific cell types, with the effects of a given ligand/receptor system determined by cell type-specific signalling pathways that may be linked to unique cis-regulatory elements of the TN gene. As a result, a limited set of regulatory peptides may produce highly diversified TN distribution patterns in developing and lesional tissues.",Immunology
7511405,"Tumour progression of human neuroblastoma cells tagged with a lacZ marker gene: earliest events at ectopic injection sites. Human Platt neuroblastoma cells were transfected with the marker gene, bacterial lacZ, to track cells at the earliest stages after ectopic injection at two different sites in athymic nude mice. Three clones (LZPt-1,-2 and -3) of differing morphologies were analysed. All clones yielded large primary tumours subcutaneously or intradermally with similar latency. While LZPt-2 and -3 clones generated well-staining primary tumours, LZPt-1 cells yielded many non-staining tumours, indicating greater instability of lacZ expression for this clone in situ (stability of lacZ expression in culture was similar for all three clones). After s.c. or intradermal injections, tumour cells were tracked for 1 h to > 3 weeks (palpable) to evaluate the topology and population expansion characteristics at the earliest times. From 1 h to 2 days, tumour cells were concentrated in central masses with 'crinkly hair' distributions emanating from the periphery. Between 3 and 7 days, these 'crinkly hair' patterns were cleared from the tissue, leaving dense ovoid patterns of tumour cells. These concentrations of cells expanded collectively, not by division of one or a few cells, but by division of many cells. For clone LZPt-1, cells stained well with X-gal for 2-3 days; by 7 days, most cells were non-staining. Evidence suggests that lacZ expression is turned off in these tumour cells, rather than a lacZ- cell type clonally dominating the population. For all three clones, tumour cells remained rounded and did not spread in any tissue environment at all time points, indicating very different matrix adhesion mechanisms operating in situ compared with their distinctive spreading patterns in culture. Angioneogenesis near primary tumours became evident by 2-3 days, leading to extensive vascularisation by 1-2 weeks. Overall, these studies indicate common tumour progression characteristics for three different clones of human neuroblastoma, insight into lacZ instability mechanisms operating in one of these clones and the earliest events in primary tumour formation for this tumour at two different ectopic sites.",Immunology
7511348,"Heterogeneous populations of K+ channels mediate EDRF release to flow but not agonists in rabbit aorta. We have investigated the role of Ca(2+)- and ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KCa and KATP, respectively) in flow- and agonist-stimulated release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). Segments of rabbit abdominal aorta, perfused at constant flow with buffer containing indomethacin, were used as a source of EDRF in cascade bioassay, and responses to endothelium-dependent agonists were studied isometrically in rings of the same tissue in the absence of flow. Apamin, charybdotoxin (ChTX), and tetraethylammonium (TEA) were used to block a variety of low, medium, and high conductance KCa channels, and glibenclamide was used to block KATP channels. The effects of flow pulsatility were studied at pulse frequencies ranging from 0.15 to 9.75 Hz, and time-averaged shear stress was manipulated by adding dextran (80,000 mol wt) to the perfusate to increase its viscosity. Frequency-related EDRF release was maximal at approximately 5 Hz and attenuated by apamin, TEA, and ChTX, but not by glibenclamide. EDRF release stimulated by increased viscosity was attenuated by TEA, ChTX, and glibenclamide, but not by apamin. In marked contrast, EDRF release stimulated by acetylcholine and ATP was unaffected by blockade of either KCa or KATP channels. We conclude that a spectrum of KCa channel subtypes mediates endothelial transduction of the oscillatory component of pulsatile flow and that KATP channels may be additionally involved in the transduction of time-averaged shear stress. In contrast, agonist-stimulated endothelium-dependent relaxation is independent of K+ channel activation in rabbit aorta.",Immunology

Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a model for genetic studies of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We have identified 15 MODY families in which diabetes is not the result of mutations in the glucokinase gene. This cohort of families will be useful for identifying other diabetes-susceptibility genes. Nine other candidate genes potentially implicated in insulin secretion or insulin action have been tested for linkage with MODY in these families, including glucokinase regulatory protein, hexokinase II, insulin receptor substrate 1, fatty acid-binding protein 2, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor, apolipoprotein C-II, glycogen synthase, adenosine deaminase (a marker for the MODY gene on chromosome 20), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. None of these loci showed evidence for linkage with MODY, implying that mutations in these genes do not make a major genetic contribution to the development of MODY. In addition to these linkage analyses, one or two affected subjects from each family were screened for the presence of the A to G mutation at nucleotide 3,243 of the mitochondrial tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene. This mutation was not found in any of these subjects. Finally, we report the localization of the gene encoding the regulatory protein of glucokinase to chromosome 2, band p22.3 and the identification of a restriction fragment length polymorphism at this locus.",Immunology

The data on the fasciocutaneous vascularisation of the medial aspect of the arm are incomplete in the literature. This study presents the methodology and results of an anatomic study on 19 upper limbs with arterial injection. The vascularisation of the upper part of this region is provided in 68% of cases by the superficial fasciocutaneous branch (SFCB) of the superior ulnar collateral artery (SUC), that of the middle and lower part by 3-4 fasciocutaneous pedicles originating from the SUC which are prolonged distally by the recurrent posterior ulnar artery. The SFCB has important relations with the ulnar nerve; it travels dorsal to the nerve in 64% of cases and then allows the raising of a distally-pedicled ulnar flap with a 3:1 ratio. In other anatomic configurations, a flap with retrograde flow supplied by the inferior pedicles of the SUC can always be raised. Its ratio is then 2:1. this flap allows coverage of all cases of posterior or anterior losses of substance at the elbow. These results supplement the data required for the raising of a distally-pedicled medial brachial flap, but also of a proximally-pedicled superior medial brachial flap and of a free superior medial brachial flap transposed by microsurgical means.",Immunology
7539810,"The basal keratin network of stratified squamous epithelia: defining K15 function in the absence of K14. Keratin 5 and keratin 14 have been touted as the hallmarks of the basal keratin networks of all stratified squamous epithelia. Absence of K14 gives rise to epidermolysis bullosa simplex, a human blistering skin disorder involving cytolysis in the basal layer of epidermis. To address the puzzling question of why this disease is primarily manifested in skin rather than other stratified squamous epithelia, we ablated the K14 gene in mice and examined various tissues expressing this gene. We show that a key factor is the presence of another keratin, K15, which was hitherto unappreciated as a basal cell component. We show that the levels of K15 relative to K14 vary dramatically among stratified squamous epithelial tissues, and with neonatal development. In the absence of K14, K15 makes a bona fide, but ultrastructurally distinct, keratin filament network with K5. In the epidermis of neonatal mutant mice, K15 levels are low and do not compensate for the loss of K14. In contrast, the esophagus is unaffected in the neonatal mutant mice, but does appear to be fragile in the adult. Parallel to this phenomenon is that esophageal K14 is expressed at extremely low levels in the neonate, but rises in postnatal development. Finally, despite previous conclusions that the formation of suprabasal keratin filaments might depend upon K5/K14, we find that a wide variety of suprabasal networks composed of different keratins can form in the absence of K14 in the basal layer.",Immunology
7539557,"Regulation of prostatic smooth muscle contractility by intracellular second messengers: implications for the conservative treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The increased sympathetic neurotransmission in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) results in a alpha 1C-adrenoceptor-mediated increase in prostatic smooth muscle tone which seems to be responsible for the dynamic infravesical obstruction occurring in BPH. The prostatic smooth muscle contractions evoked by norepinephrine can be efficiently blocked by alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockers. Moreover, an impressive number of clinical trials illustrated the beneficial results of alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockers in the treatment of BPH. However, despite knowledge of alpha 1-adrenergic neurotransmission and the clinical application of its blockade by selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, very little is known about the intracellular pathways involved in the regulation of prostatic smooth muscle contractility. To study the intracellular mechanism of the alpha 1C-adrenoceptor-induced prostatic smooth muscle contraction, the patch-clamp technique in the whole-cell configuration mode combined with the Fura-II fluorescence technique was used in human, enzymatically isolated smooth muscle cells obtained from patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate because of symptomatic BPH. Furthermore changes in prostatic smooth muscle contractility were registered in organ bath experiments. Application of the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (PE) increased the L-type Ca(2+)-channel current (ICa) dose dependently from 8 up to 18.5 microA/cm2, simultaneously elevating the free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) up to 1.9 microM. Pretreating the myocytes with pertussis toxin, an exotoxin of Bordetella pertussis which inactivates GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) of the Gi and G(o) family by ADP ribosylation, reduced the PE-induced ICa stimulation by 71.5 +/- 5.6% (n = 21). Dialysis of the cytosol with the second messenger inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which releases Ca2+ from intracellular non-mitochondrial, IP3-sensitive Ca2+ pools, imitated the PE-evoked responses. Pretreating the myocytes with the Ca(2+)-release blockers ryanodine (10-100 microM, n = 8), thapsigargin (0.1 microM, n = 11) or low-molecular weight heparin (n = 14) largely attenuated the PE-evoked responses. The experimental results suggest a coupling of alpha 1-adrenoceptors to phospholipase C-converting phosphoinositol-4,5-bisphosphate into diacylglycerol, an endogenous activator of the protein kinase C and IP3 which releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores stimulating ICa via Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase induced phosphorylation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. This knowledge could be of interest for conservative treatment in symptomatic BPH.",Immunology

Heparan sulphate-reactive antibodies in lupus sera have been suggested to be anti-DNA-DNA/histone immune complexes and to be associated with lupus nephritis. In this study, 23 anti-DNA-positive lupus sera including 13 active nephritis sera were tested for the presence of circulating anti-DNA-DNA/histone immune complexes by solid phase heparan sulphate-ELISA. Because of high background binding to protamine chloride-linked heparan sulphate plates, poly-L-lysine (PLL) was used as a linker and the remaining active sites of PLL were blocked with poly-L-glutamic acid. The ELISA was capable of detecting small amounts of anti-DNA IgG-DNA/histone immune complexes formed in vitro. However, only three active nephritis sera of the 23 sera tested showed significant binding to heparan sulphate plates. This binding was found to be non-specific, the result of high background binding of IgG to PLL. Anti-heparan sulphate ELISA using positively charged linkers detects non-specific binding when lupus sera are tested. Specific assays need to be developed for DNA/histone-related immune complexes present in lupus sera.",Immunology
7539063,"Differential effects of vincristine and phenytoin on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human glioma cell lines. The aim of this study was to investigate the antimigratory and antiinvasive potential of vincristine sulfate (VCR) on human glioma cells and to analyze whether phenytoin (5,5-diphenylhydantoin; DPH) might act synergistically with VCR. Vincristine affects the cytoplasmic microtubules; DPH has been reported to enhance VCR cytotoxicity in murine cells. In two human glioma cell lines, GaMG and D-37MG, we found VCR to reduce monolayer growth and colony formation in a dose-dependent fashion at concentrations of 10 ng/ml and above. Phenytoin increased the cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of VCR in monolayer cells but not in spheroids. Multicellular spheroids were used to investigate directional migration. A coculture system of GaMG and D-37MG spheroids with fetal rat brain aggregates was used to analyze and quantify tumor cell invasion. A dose-dependent inhibition of migration and invasion by VCR was observed in both cell lines without further enhancement by DPH. Immunofluorescence microscopy with antibodies against alpha-tubulin revealed dose-dependent morphological alterations in the microtubules when the cells were exposed to VCR but not after incubation with DPH. Based on the combination of standardized in vitro model systems currently in use and the present data, the authors strongly suggest that VCR inhibits migration and invasion of human glioma cells. This is not altered by DPH, which inhibits cell proliferation in combination with VCR.",Immunology
7539020,"The natural human IgG anti-F(ab')2 antibody recognizes a conformational IgG1 hinge epitope. Natural IgG anti-F(ab')2 Abs are part of the physiologic immune repertoire and have important immunoregulatory functions. Although previous work suggested that some of these Abs recognize epitopes located in the constant region of the F(ab')2 molecule, an exact epitope mapping has not been performed. We found that the anti-F(ab')2 Ab binds strongly to F(ab')2 but only weakly to Fab fragments. Fab fragments are lacking the core and lower hinge region. In our experiments, we show that the IgG anti-F(ab')2 Ab binds strongly to a synthetic double chain peptide (225-237/225'-237') comprising the core and lower hinge region of the human IgG1 molecule. In contrast, it binds only weakly to the same peptide in monomeric form (225-237) or to a short double chain hinge peptide (225-232/225'-232'). The double chain peptides comprise a cyclic region between the two cystine bridges and an exocyclic region. Previous nuclear magnetic resonance analyses showed that the cyclic portion of the short double chain hinge peptide adopts the same conformation as that found in the intact IgG1 molecule. The dichroic properties of the short and long double chain hinge peptides indicate that they have identical conformations in their cyclic regions, but have different conformations in their exocyclic regions. The conformational differences in the exocyclic regions explain the binding of the Ab to the long double chain hinge peptide and the lack of binding to the short one. The circular dichroism spectrum of the monomeric hinge peptide, which is not recognized by the Ab, is consistent with the absence of an ordered peptide structure. These findings lead us to conclude that the IgG anti-F(ab')2 Ab recognizes a conformational IgG1 hinge epitope.",Immunology

In order to examine optimum staining agents and conditions, acridine orange, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), FITC-conjugated concanavalin A (FITC-ConA), Evans blue, safranine and rhodamine-conjugated concanavalin A were used in three different medium (pH 4.5, pH 7.5, pH 9.5). Only extracellular matrix was stained as a net-like structure for FITC-ConA and only bacteria for acridine orange and safranine. Although the staining patterns with FITC and Evans blue were affected markedly by the medium pH, those with other staining agents were not affected significantly. It was considered that the staining characteristics specific for each agent and changes of staining pattern by pH were probably due to relative differences among matrix, bacteria and staining agents in their electrostatic charges.

Immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that CD34 antigen is present on the surface of vascular endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells. Roles of CD34 for angiogenesis and its function as a homophilic adhesion molecule between endothelial and hematopoietic cells have been speculated. Northern blotting was used to examine the expression levels of CD34 mRNA, and in situ hybridization was used to localize CD34 mRNA. First, we investigated changes in CD34 mRNA expression in developmental processes of mice. Second, we investigated the changes in skin tissues of adult mice in the process of wound healing and tumor growth. CD34 mRNA was strongly expressed by most of the vascular endothelial cells in developing organs. The magnitude of the expression decreased after birth but increased again in the process of wound healing and tumor growth. Although CD34 mRNA signals were observed in hematopoietic cells in the yolk sac and fetal liver, the endothelial cells of these tissues did not express CD34 mRNA signals. CD34 mRNA signals were detectable in neither hematopoietic nor endothelial cells of the bone marrow. In tissues other than hematopoietic ones, however, blood cells within the vessels did not express CD34 mRNA, although the endothelial cells expressed CD34 mRNA. The expression pattern of CD34 mRNA suggested its significant role in development of blood vessels not only in embryos but also in adults. Although CD34 mRNA was expressed both by endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells, the expression did not occur within the same organ, suggesting that the CD34 molecule may not be used as a homophilic adhesion molecule between endothelial and hematopoietic cells.",Immunology
7538174,"Identification of regions in polyomavirus middle T and small t antigens important for association with protein phosphatase 2A. Two subunits of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) have been shown previously to bind to the small t and middle T antigens (ST and MT, respectively) of polyomavirus. To determine sequences important for binding of PP2A to ST and MT, we first constructed a series of ST mutants in regions known to be important for biological activity of ST and MT. Several mutations in two small regions just amino terminal to the Cys-X-Cys-X-X-Cys motifs of ST and MT abolished PP2A binding to ST in vitro. Parallel mutations were constructed in MT to investigate the role of PP2A binding in the function of polyomavirus MT. Wild-type and mutant MT proteins were stably expressed in NIH 3T3 cells and analyzed (i) for their ability to induce transformation and (ii) for associated cellular proteins and corresponding enzymatic activities previously described as associating with wild-type MT. A number of the mutant MTs were found to be defective in binding of PP2A as assayed by coimmunoprecipitation. In contrast, a deletion of the highly conserved stretch of amino acids 42 to 47 (His-Pro-Asp-Lys-Gly-Gly) in the ST-MT-large T antigen common region did not affect PP2A binding to MT. MT mutants defective for PP2A binding were also defective in transformation, providing further evidence that association with PP2A is important for the ability of MT to transform cells. All mutants which were impaired for PP2A binding were similarly or more dramatically impaired for associated protein and lipid kinase activities, supporting the possibility that PP2A binding is necessary for the formation and/or stability of an MT-pp60c-src complex.",Immunology

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and aplastic anemia are associated either as a PNH-aplasia syndrome or the emergence of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-(GPI)deficient blood cells in patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA). It could be demonstrated that SAA patients with GPI-deficient cells in comparison to those without have a worse response to classical immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, we treated a female PNH patient with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia and granulopenia with G-CSF and cyclosporine. Within 8 weeks, a trilineage response of hematopoiesis was observed. In addition, the proportion of normal to GPI-deficient granulocytes and monocytes increased significantly.",Immunology
7537977,"Xanthomonas maltophilia misidentified as Pseudomonas cepacia in cultures of sputum from patients with cystic fibrosis: a diagnostic pitfall with major clinical implications. Pseudomonas cepacia infection in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has major significance in terms of infection control, psychosocial issues, and medical treatment. We describe three instances in which the diagnostic laboratory misidentified Xanthomonas maltophilia as P. cepacia in cultures of sputum from patients with CF. These errors were recognized when 3 (9%) of 32 isolates, which had all been identified as P. cepacia and had been submitted to the Canadian Pseudomonas Repository Laboratory (Vancouver, BC), were correctly identified there as X. maltophilia. Each of the three isolates grew well on P. cepacia media, turned a characteristic vivid pink color, were polymyxin-resistant, and were lysine-positive. All three were initially characterized incorrectly as oxidase-positive and DNase-negative. The diagnostic laboratory then reexamined 24 other isolates that had been identified as P. cepacia; complete biochemical testing confirmed that all were indeed P. cepacia. Because infection due to P. cepacia has major implications for patients with CF, when a possible strain of P. cepacia is isolated, careful and complete characterization should be performed.",Immunology
7537779,"Axon-reflex-mediated vasodilatation in the psoriatic plaque?. Blood flow in the psoriatic plaque is increased, but the underlying mechanisms are not known. The aim of the present study was to examine whether neurogenic factors are important for blood flow regulation in the plaque. Local neurogenic mechanisms were inhibited by surface anesthesia and central nervous control by conduction anesthesia of nerves to the psoriatic plaque. The differences in skin perfusion before and after anesthesia were measured with a laser Doppler perfusion imager. The skin perfusion in psoriatic plaques located in hairy skin was unaffected by conduction anesthesia, but surface anesthesia of the plaque evoked a marked blood flow reduction. The perfusion in ultraviolet-B-irradiated skin, used as a control for nonspecific phenomena, was reduced after local application of indomethacin but was unaffected or increased after surface anesthesia. The results are compatible with the idea that a local neurogenic mechanism (axon-reflex) contributes to the high blood flow in the psoriatic plaque.",Immunology

Changes in post-rest and post-test ionic concentrations and [K+]/[Na+], replicated earlier studies. Phasic [K+]/[Na+] changes were mainly due to [K+] changes. Significant increases in [K+] and decreases in [Na+] from a relaxed session, the day before CRT testing, to the testing session per se indicated test anticipation effects. In both groups, changes from pre-test ""rest"" to ""on test"" were significant only for [K+]. [K+] discriminated well between conditions in hypertensives. This was interpreted in terms of adaptive changes in sympathetic activation.

Peripheral blood stem cells were collected by leukapheresis during initial early WBC recovery from chemotherapy-induced aplasia. In 5/10 patients all metaphases in leukapheresis products were found to be Philadelphia-chromosome-negative and they have been used as autotransplants after conditioning with TBI/etoposide/cyclophosphamide (or idarubicin) and G-CSF. All five patients showed sustained engraftment and one of them is alive and well Philadelphia-chromosome-negative 18 months after transplant.

7537489,"Use of aprotinin in LVAD recipients reduces blood loss, blood use, and perioperative mortality. Aprotinin, a bovine protease inhibitor, has been used extensively in patients undergoing cardiac surgical procedures in an effort to minimize blood loss and prevent the complications associated with blood replacement. We sought to evaluate the effect of aprotinin on postoperative blood loss, renal function, and the incidence of right ventricular failure in patients undergoing placement of a TCI Heartmate left ventricular assist device as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. Retrospective data analysis in 142 patients (42 receiving aprotinin and 100 untreated) demonstrated that the use of aprotinin was associated with a significant decrease in postoperative blood loss (p = 0.019) and in the intraoperative packed red blood cell transfusion (p = 0.019) and total blood product (p = 0.016) requirements. A transient, yet significant, increase in the postoperative creatinine level in the aprotinin group (p = 0.0006), but not in blood urea nitrogen level (p = 0.22), was noted. Interestingly, we noted an association between blood loss and the subsequent development of right ventricular failure; patients who required a right ventricular assist device bled significantly more than did those who did not suffer right ventricular failure (p = 0.02). Additionally, aprotinin recipients benefited by a reduction of nearly one half in the incidence of the need for a right ventricular assist device. The incidence of perioperative mortality was reduced in those receiving aprotinin compared with that in untreated patients, (p = 0.05). We conclude that aprotinin is safe and effective in decreasing postoperative blood loss and intraoperative blood product requirements, and in reducing perioperative mortality in patients undergoing left ventricular assist device placement as a bridge to cardiac transplantation.",Immunology
7537351,"The effect of fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, and pericytes on sprout formation of endothelial cells in a fibrin gel angiogenesis system. We have recently shown that during angiogenesis in situ, sprouting and newly formed capillaries appear to be composed of two cell types, endothelial cells and nonendothelial, pericyte-like cells. The effect of pericytes on the process of neovessel formation is largely unknown. To study the influence of nonendothelial cell types on endothelial tubule formation, we have performed coculture experiments in a fibrin-clot angiogenesis system. When seeded below a critical density on the surface of fibrin gels, endothelial cells (from macro- or microvascular origin) did not show spontaneous formation of sprouts. However, in superconfluent cell cultures or after stimulation of endothelial cells with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), endothelial cells frequently acquired an elongated shape. By stimulation of endothelial cells with both bFGF and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), development of short capillary-like structures was induced. When endothelial cells were cocultivated with a cell type of high fibrinolytic potential, i.e., fibroblasts, development of capillary-like formations could not be detected. Cocultivation of endothelial cells with vascular smooth muscle cells or with retinal pericytes also did not increase the number of capillary-like formations in fibrin gels. In contrast, vascular smooth muscle cells on their own could be demonstrated to give rise to branched capillary-like networks in fibrin, which easily could be mistaken for true capillaries. Our results indicate that periendothelial cells contribute to angiogenesis not only by fibrinolysis and proteolytic permeation of the extracellular matrix. Rather, the interactions of endothelial cells and pericyte-like cells, as frequently observed during neovessel formation in situ, appear to be more specific and may require factors hitherto unknown.",Immunology
7537340,"Characterisation of epitopes on human p53 using phage-displayed peptide libraries: insights into antibody-peptide interactions. We previously described the use of a phage-displayed library of random hexapeptides to define and localise the epitope on the human tumor suppressor protein p53 recognised by the monoclonal antibody PAb240. Here we have extended these results to a further eight anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies and to two further libraries, which display 12-mer and 20-mer peptides, respectively. First, we showed that selection of PAb240 binding clones from the 12-mer and 20-mer libraries gives essentially identical results to those obtained by screening the 6-mer library. Second, we used the 6-mer and 12-mer libraries to define the detailed specificity profiles of six antibodies (DO-1, DO-2, DO-7, Bp53-11, Bp53-12 and Bp53-19), which recognise the same short, highly immunogenic N-terminal segment of p53. Finally, we employed all three libraries to reveal the distinct mechanisms by which PAb421 and PAb122, two monoclonal antibodies that allosterically activate sequence-specific DNA binding by p53, react specifically with the same positively-charged C-terminal segment. In each case the epitope locations inferred from the selected sequences were confirmed by probing an array of overlapping synthetic peptides representing the primary sequence of p53. The results emphasise the consequences for epitope mapping of screening random, as opposed to antigen-derived, peptide libraries; specifically (1) that comparison of selected sequences reveals the contribution of individual residues to binding energy and specificity; (2) that heteroclitic reactions can lead to definition of a consensus that is related to but distinct from the immunising epitope and (3) that isolation of non-immunogen-homologous ""mimotope"" sequences reveals discrete, alternative ligand structures. The results with PAb421 and PAb122 provide examples where, while selection from the 12-mer and 20-mer libraries leads to isolation of immunogen-homologous sequences, selection from the 6-mer library results in the isolation either of no binding clones (PAb122) or solely of ""mimotope"" sequences with no discernible homology to the original antigen (PAb421). In addition the results with PAb421 reveal that linear epitopes can be longer than previously thought and can be formally discontinuous, consisting of independent contact motifs, which show promiscuous relative positioning.",Immunology

7537305,"Development of antimalaria immunity in mice lacking IFN-gamma receptor. IFN-gamma receptor deficient (IFN-gamma R-/-) mice, immunized with different developmental stages of malaria parasites, were used to define the mechanisms of protection against the various stages of this infection. IFN-gamma R-/- mice failed to develop protective immunity against Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites or liver stages, upon immunization with a single dose of irradiated sporozoites, whereas in immunized wild-type mice, parasite development was strongly inhibited. Immunized wild-type mice expressed high levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA in their liver, upon challenge with viable sporozoites, whereas only background levels of iNOS were detected in immunized IFN-gamma R-/- mice. In contrast, after immunization with multiple doses of irradiated sporozoites, both IFN-gamma R-/- and wild-type mice mounted an immune response, which strongly inhibited the development of liver stage parasites. In both types of mice, protection occurred in the absence of appreciable expression of liver iNOS mRNA. As for the course of the erythrocytic phase of infection by nonlethal malaria species, P. yoelii yoelii and P. chabaudi adami, we observed only a moderately prolonged parasitemia in IFN-gamma R-/- mice compared with wild-type mice, indicating that IFN-gamma may only play a modest role in immunity against erythrocytic stages. These results indicate that IFN-gamma is the main mediator of the protective mechanism that develops first upon immunization with sporozoites. However, the nature of the anti-parasite mechanism(s) changes in the course of immunization, so that multiple immunizing doses elicit additional protective mechanisms, which are independent of IFN-gamma and its receptor.",Immunology

To determine the effect of diabetes mellitus on the levels of substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in the rat cornea and iris. Corneas and irides from control and diabetic rats were processed for neuropeptide radioimmunoassay 3 months after induction of diabetes with streptozotocin. Corneas and irides also were processed for SP and CGRP immunohistochemistry and were evaluated qualitatively. The radioimmunoassay data revealed no significant differences in either the content or concentration of SP, CGRP, and VIP between control and diabetic corneas. In contrast, iridial levels of CGRP and SP were significantly increased by 38% and 256%, respectively, in the diabetic animals. Iridial VIP levels were unchanged in the diabetic versus control groups. Immunohistochemical demonstrations of corneal and iridial SP- and CGRP-immunoreactive fiber plexuses were indistinguishable on the basis of purely qualitative criteria. The results of this study have demonstrated a target- and peptide-specific effect of short-term diabetes on SP and CGRP expression in ocular nerves of the anterior eye segment. The absence of demonstrable changes in corneal neuropeptide levels argue against the theory that corneal abnormalities seen in clinical diabetes are caused, in part, by deficits in synthesis or axonal transport of ""trophic"" peptides in corneal sensory nerves. In contrast, elevated iridial SP and CGRP levels may be responsible for reported clinical deficits in pupillary diameter regulation.",Immunology
7537214,"A major role for the protein tyrosine kinase JAK1 in the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway in response to interleukin-6. The protein tyrosine kinases JAK1, JAK2 and Tyk2 and STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) 1 and 3 are activated in response to interleukin-6 (IL-6) in human fibrosarcoma cells. In mutant cells lacking JAK1, JAK2 or Tyk2, the absence of one kinase does not prevent activation of the others; activation does not, therefore, involve a sequential three-kinase cascade. In the absence of JAK1, the phosphorylation of the gp130 subunit of the IL-6 receptor and the activation of STATs 1 and 3 are greatly reduced. JAK1 is also necessary for the induction of IRF1 mRNA, thus establishing a requirement for the JAK/STAT pathway in the IL-6 response. JAK2 and Tyk2 although activated cannot, in the absence of JAK1, efficiently mediate activation of STATs 1 and 3. A kinase-negative mutant of JAK2 can, however, inhibit such activation, and ancillary roles for JAK2 and Tyk2 are not excluded. A major role for JAK1 and the nonequivalence of JAK1 and JAK2 in the IL-6 response pathway are, nevertheless, clearly established for these cells.",Immunology
7537154,"Systemic antitumor effects of electrochemotherapy combined with histoincompatible cells secreting interleukin-2. Electrochemotherapy is an antitumor treatment that combines a cytotoxic drug with the local administration of electric pulses delivered at the tumor site. We previously found that in mice the cure rate of subcutaneous transplanted tumors treated by electrochemotherapy is increased by repeated systemic interleukin-2 (IL-2) injections. Moreover, histoincompatible cells engineered to secrete IL-2 allow the rejection of syngeneic tumor cells when both cells are inoculated together. In this study of preestablished tumors in mice we show that after electrochemotherapy, delayed peritumoral injections of histoincompatible IL-2-producing cells result in the cure of almost all the tumors. Moreover, this combined local treatment leads to cures of untreated, contralaterally transplanted tumors. This systemic antitumor immunity also resulted in complete protection of the cured mice against further inocula of the tumor cells. These results, which were obtained using allogeneic as well as xenogeneic IL-2-secreting cells, suggest that electrochemotherapy combined with such cellular immunotherapy might be a useful approach for the treatment of metastasizing cancers.",Immunology

Pretreatment of spleen cells with monoclonal antibody against CD4, but not CD8, abrogated IFN production suggesting that CD4+ lymphocytes are responsible for immune IFN production.

Partially purified immune IFN retained antiviral and macrophage-activating factor (MAF)-like activities. Normal peripheral blood macrophages, when cultured in the presence of partially purified immune IFN, showed a dose-dependent increase in cell surface major histocompatibility complex Class II antigen expression by flow cytometry. Northern blot analysis of mRNA obtained from IFN-treated macrophages showed a concomitant increase in Class II gene expression.

Modulation of intracellular glutathione concentration was associated with changes in cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the addition of O-phenanthroline to the cellular medium reduced significantly BLM toxicity, suggesting the involvement of intra-cellular ferric ion.

Protective effect of O-phenanthroline and the involvement of glutathione may be an alternative approach to the protection of BLM-induced damage.",Immunology

The effects of capsaicin on the sensory neuropeptides substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide were analyzed in the ankle joints and dorsal root ganglia (L2-L6) of adult female Lewis rats. The study included 23 normal rats and 23 arthritic rats, all injected subcutaneously with capsaicin (total dose 200 mg/kg bw). Another two groups of animals from a previous study, i.e., 23 normal rats and 23 arthritic rats not given capsaicin served as controls. Adjuvant arthritis was induced by inoculation with heat-killed mycobacteria. The morphological distribution of sensory neuropeptides was assessed by immunohistochemistry and the tissue concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. In normal rats, capsaicin significantly reduced the concentrations of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide in ankle joints (54 and 36%, respectively) as well as dorsal root ganglia (40 and 54%, respectively). In arthritic rats those pretreated with capsaicin had significantly lower concentrations of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide in dorsal root ganglia (19 and 42%, respectively) compared to the arthritic controls. In the ankle joints, however, only the SP concentration was reduced (42%). Notably, this was accompanied by a 40% reduction in inflammatory response as assessed by comparing the ankle joint weights of the experimental groups. In general, there was a good correlation between the neuropeptide concentrations in ipsilateral ankle joints and the corresponding dorsal root ganglia as assessed in individual rats. The present study of adjuvant induced arthritis shows that capsaicin administration reduces the otherwise up-regulated levels of sensory neuropeptides in dorsal root ganglia and ankle joints. However, capsaicin at the dose given can only mitigate, not completely prevent the development of joint inflammation. Nonetheless, the findings suggest that antineuronal therapy targeted against specific neurotransmitters may prove useful in inflammatory joint disease.",Immunology

Medical Research Council Lung Cancer Working Party. This study was conducted to test the feasibility of reducing the interval between cycles of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide (ACE) chemotherapy to 2 weeks, thereby increasing dose intensity, by adding granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to reduce the duration of neutropenia following a cycle. 20 patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) were prescribed six cycles of 2-weekly ACE, with G-CSF on the intermediate days. 3 patients died during the treatment period and a further 5 had ACE terminated, 3 for toxicity and 2 for progressive disease. Of the 71 intervals between cycles, 42 (59%) were of the prescribed 14 days, 9 (13%) of 15-20 days, 15 (21%) of 21 days and five (7%) longer, but during the first four cycles, 36 (77%) of 47 intervals were of 14 days. The main reason for delay was haematological toxicity.

Increasing evidence indicates that cationic liposomes are capable of safely transferring foreign genes to pulmonary epithelium in vitro and in vivo.

Lipid-DNA conjugates containing either CFTR or LacZ were instilled directly into the airways of Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats treated with LacZ cDNA in vivo demonstrated expression in 30-50% of the large and medium-sized airways, with some airways showing high efficiency gene transfer and expression (in the most proximal airways, 70-80% of surface epithelial cells were positive for expression of a nuclear targeted LacZ). While control and LacZ treated tracheas mounted in Ussing chambers showed minimal stimulation of transepithelial chloride (Cl)-currents by cAMP (suggesting low levels of endogenous rat CFTR activity), tracheas taken from animals receiving CFTR exhibited significant forskolin-stimulated currents at 72 h after gene transfer. Human CFTR gene expression was also detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of reverse transcribed lung RNA. These results, together with previous studies using lipid-mediated gene transfer in mice, help confirm the potential for cationic lipid-mediated gene transfer in the gene therapy of cystic fibrosis in humans.",Immunology
7535718,"A novel role for a U5 snRNP protein in 3' splice site selection. The choice of a 3' splice site in Saccharomyces cerevisiae introns involves recognition of a uridine-rich tract upstream of the AG dinucleotide splice junction. By isolating mutants that eliminate the normal preference for uridine-containing 3' splice sites in a cis-competition, we identified a mutation that is an allele of PRP8, prp8-101. This was unexpected because previous analysis has demonstrated that the U5 snRNP protein encoded by PRP8 is required for spliceosome assembly prior to the first catalytic step of splicing. In contrast, the uridine recognition defect caused by the prp8-101 mutation selectively inhibits the second catalytic step of splicing. This defect is seen not only in 3' splice site cis-competitions but also in the splicing of an unusual intron in the TUB3 gene and in the ACT1 intron when utilization of its 3' splice site is rate limiting for splicing. Consistent with a direct role in 3' splice site selection, Prp8 can be cross-linked to the 3' splice site during the splicing reaction. These data demonstrate a novel function for Prp8 in 3' splice site recognition and utilization.",Immunology

During the period from July 1986 to June 1992, 41 patients were randomised to receive FEMTX or best supportive care. MTX was given in a dose of 1500 mg m-2 intravenously (i.v.) followed after 1 h by 5-FU 1500 mg m-2 i.v. on day 1; leucovorin rescue was started after 24 h (30 mg orally every 6 h for 48 h) and epidoxorubicin 60 mg m-2 i.v. was administered on day 15. In addition both groups received tablets containing vitamins A and E. Response rates for FEMTX were as follows: complete response (CR), 19% (4/21); partial response (PR), 10% (2/21); no change (NC), 33% (7/21); and progressive disease (PD), 24% (5/21). Response rates in the control group were: NC, 20% (4/20); and PD, 80% (16/20). Increased pain was observed in one patient in the treated group and in 11 patients in the control group within the first 2 months. WHO grade III/IV toxicity in the chemotherapy group was as follows: nausea/vomiting 40%, diarrhoea 10%, stomatitis 15%, leucopenia 50% and thrombocytopenia 10%. One possible treatment-related death was due to sepsis. The median time to progression in the FEMTX group was 5.4 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.1-11.7 months], but only 1.7 months in the control group (95% CI 1.2-2.7 months) (P = 0.0013). Similarly, the FEMTX group displayed significantly (P = 0.0006) prolonged survival compared with the control group, i.e. median survival 12.3 months (95% CI 7.1-15.6 months) vs 3.1 months (95% CI 1.6-4.6 months). In conclusion, FEMTX combined with vitamin A and E is a fairly well-tolerated treatment, giving a response rate of 29% in patients with advanced gastric cancer, and also prolonging patients' survival.

7533503,"Enhancer sharing in a plasmid model containing the alpha-fetoprotein and albumin promoters. It has been proposed that the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) enhancers also regulate the adjacent albumin gene, since the -10 kbp albumin enhancer is inactive in a number of cell lines that express albumin. In transfection experiments, the AFP enhancers strongly stimulate the albumin promoter in cells that silence the AFP promoter. These observations led us to develop a plasmid model of AFP-albumin gene switching, in which the albumin and AFP promoters would compete for the three AFP enhancers. However, when AFPCAT + ALBgal genes were combined with the AFP enhancers in one plasmid, both genes were driven at full activity. There was no change in the relative promoter expression over a wide range of transfected DNA concentrations, demonstrating that relative promoter activity was independent of DNA concentration and of promoter concentration, and that neither promoter was limiting the expression of the other. In contrast, a control plasmid containing two albumin promoters showed mutual inhibition, indicating the expected promoter competition. The albumin and AFP promoters noncompetitively shared the three enhancers on this plasmid, resulting in high levels of transcription from both promoters.",Immunology

7533344,"An increased incidence of Epstein-Barr virus infection and lymphoproliferative disorder in young children on FK506 after liver transplantation. The incidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) was determined in a pediatric liver transplant population consisting of 51 children treated with FK506 and 91 treated with cyclosporine. The incidence of symptomatic EBV infection was 21.9% (23 of 105 cases) in children < 5 yr old and 10.8% (4 of 37 cases) in children 5 to 17 yr old as compared with 2.7% (9 of 323 cases) in adults (P < 0.0001). In the under 5 yr old group on cyclosporine, the incidences of EBV infection and LPD were 9 of 68 (13.2%) and 2 of 68 children, (2.9%), respectively. In contrast, in children under 5 yr old group on FK506, the incidences of EBV infection and LPD in the FK506 group were 14 of 37 (37.8%) and 7 of 37 children (18.9%), respectively. The difference between these two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.02). There were no cases of LPD in the 5-17 yr-old children on either cyclosporine (n = 23) or FK506 (n = 14). The incidence of EBV infections in the 5 to 17 yr age group, 17.4% on cyclosporine and 0% on FK506, was less than for the younger children on FK506 (37.8%). A total of 39% (9 of 23) of children under 5 yr old who had symptomatic EBV infections developed LPD, and 44% (4 of 9) with LPD died. The higher incidence of EBV infections and LPD in the younger children treated with FK506 was probably related to a greater intensity of immunosuppression for patients on FK506 than those on cyclosporine.",Immunology

In addition the children's expressive and receptive language skills were assessed using the Renfrew Action Picture Test and the British Picture Vocabulary Scale respectively. Significant correlations were found between scores obtained on the play test and both language measures. Exploratory statistics indicated that, when age was taken into account, partial correlations between play and language remained moderate. Further analysis of the results also suggested that the relationship between play and language ability as measured by the tests was stronger for the younger children in the sample than for the older children. These results suggest that the WSPT may indeed be a useful assessment instrument, in conjunction with measures of functional play, for assessment of language ability, diagnosis and possible treatment of language disorders, especially for children under the developmental age of 5 years.",Immunology
7532420,"Characterization of the mechanism involved in bleomycin-induced increased hyaluronan production in rat lung. The molecular mechanisms behind the accumulation of hyaluronan during bleomycin-induced lung injury in rats were investigated. The stimulatory effects of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and alveolar macrophage (AM)-conditioned media on hyaluronan synthesis in normal rat lung fibroblast cultures were studied as well as the hyaluronan binding activity on AM. BALF obtained on days 1 and 5 after bleomycin instillation exhibited hyaluronan stimulatory activity similar to that of 10% fetal serum; the activity returned to control values on day 14 after bleomycin treatment. Conditioned media from cultures of AM obtained from bleomycin-treated rats exhibited stimulatory effects higher than that of media from AM of control rats and equal to or higher than that of 10% fetal calf serum. The stimulatory activity in BALF was significantly inhibited by neutralizing antibodies against transforming growth factor-beta; the activity in AM-conditioned media was only partially affected. Neutralizing antibodies against platelet-derived growth factor-BB or -AA had no such inhibiting effect. Interestingly, AM from bleomycin-treated rats exhibited low hyaluronan binding activity. [3H]Hyaluronan binding by AM on days 1 and 5 after bleomycin administration was about 2-fold and 4-fold lower, respectively, compared with that by AM derived from saline-treated rats. This decrease was normalized 14 days after bleomycin treatment. In conclusion, our results indicate that factors with high potential to stimulate hyaluronan synthesis in rat lung fibroblasts are accumulated in BALF from bleomycin-treated rats and that AM are likely to be one source of such stimulatory factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology

7530504,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha induces endothelial galactosyl transferase activity and verocytotoxin receptors. Role of specific tumor necrosis factor receptors and protein kinase C. Infections with verocytotoxin (VT) producing Escherichia coli have been strongly implicated in the epidemic form of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Endothelial damage plays a central role in the pathogenesis of HUS. In vitro studies have shown that VT can damage endothelial cells after interaction with its cellular receptor globotriaosylceramide (GbOse3cer). Cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) can potentiate the toxic effect of VT by inducing a protein-synthesis dependent increase in VT receptors on endothelial cells. In this study, the mechanisms underlying the increase in endothelial VT receptors induced by TNF alpha were studied in more detail. To investigate which proteins were involved in this induction, endothelial cells were incubated with and without TNF alpha in the presence of 14C-galactose or 14C-glucose. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis of the glycolipid extracts of these cells demonstrated a markedly enhanced incorporation of 14C-galactose in GbOse3cer and other galactose-containing glycolipids, suggesting that TNF alpha enhanced galactosyl-transferase activity. To examine the role of the two recently cloned TNF-receptors (TNFR-p75 and TNFR-p55) in the TNF alpha-induced increase in GbOse3cer in human endothelial cells, cells were incubated with TNF alpha, the TNFR-p55 selective R32W-S86T-TNF alpha-mutant, or the TNFR-p75 selective D143N-A145R-TNF alpha-mutant. The effect of TNF alpha activation, determined by binding-experiments with 125I-VT-1, could be largely, but not completely mimicked by R32W-S86T-TNF alpha. Although incubation of cells with D143N-A145R-TNF alpha did not show an increase in VT-1 binding, the monoclonal antibody utr-1, which prevents binding to TNFR-p75, decreased the TNF alpha-induced VT-1 binding. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol ester increases the expression of VT-1 receptors; this effect was prevented by the PKC inhibitor Ro31-8220 and by homologous desensitization by pretreatment with phorbol ester. In contrast, the presence of the protein kinase inhibitor Ro31-8220 or desensitization of PKC activity reduced the TNF alpha-induced increase in VT-1 receptors maximally by 50% and 24%, respectively. Comparable reductions in overall protein synthesis and the synthesis of E-selectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were observed. This suggests an effect on general protein synthesis rather than a specific effect of PKC in the signal transduction pathway, by which TNF alpha induces VT-1 receptors. Our results indicate that TNF alpha can increase the VT-1 receptors on endothelial cells by inducing galactosyl-transferase activity, that this action of TNF alpha mainly occurs via the TNFR-p55; and that PKC activation increases expression of VT-1 receptors by a separate mechanism that acts additively to the TNF alpha-induced increase in VT-1 receptors.",Immunology

Interleukin 3 (IL-3) induces proliferation and differentiation of mast cell progenitors in vitro, whereas it induces granulocytosis in vivo. In this paper, a positive feedback mechanism of granulopoiesis was studied in order to elucidate the granulocytosis induced by IL-3 in mouse. IL-3 induced expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in total bone marrow cells and a marrow adherent cell population. In fractionated marrow cell populations, a different expression pattern of induction of IL-3 stimulation was observed; GM-CSF was expressed in macrophages and fraction 1 (P < 1.061) and 2(1.061 < P 1.074) of bone marrow cells fractionated by equilibrium density centrifugation, G-CSF was expressed in macrophages and fraction 2 and 3 (1.074 < P < 1.097), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in macrophages and fraction 1 to 3. These results indicate a hierarchical regulation of cytokine production and the existence of a positive feedback mechanism in granulopoiesis. IL-6, induced by IL-3, stimulates stem cells into cycle and induces stem cells to respond to IL-3. The stem cells differentiate to granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells by the combined effect of IL-3 and IL-6. IL-3 also induces GM- and G-CSF expression which in turn makes granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells differentiate to granulocytes. These factors organize a cytokine network in granulopoiesis.",Immunology

To better understand Tec function in vivo, we generated transgenic mice expressing tec driven by the cytomegarovirus enhancer and beta-actin promoter. Among six transgenic lines generated, a particular line, named 2-11, expressed tec transgene product more widely and abundantly than the other lines. In the tissues of 2-11, the kinase activity of Tec was enhanced in accordance with the high expression of tec transgene product. Interestingly, tyrosine-phosphorylation of approximately 55KDa proteins in the tissues was induced.

Transposable elements of the DNA-mediated and RNA-mediated classes found in arthropods are briefly described and their distribution reviewed. The distribution patterns of DNA-mediated elements are extremely patchy and the principal cause appears to be the horizontal transfer of elements between host lineages. In the best documented case of mariner elements, these hosts can be in different orders of insects, classes of arthropods, and even other phyla of animals. RNA-mediated elements appear to undergo much longer periods of vertical evolution within host lineages, and evidence for their horizontal transfer remains scant. The evolutionary relationships of many of these transposons have recently been illuminated by phylogenetic analyses of the reverse-transcriptase enzymes of the RNA-mediated elements, and the recognition that the transposases of some of the DNA-mediated elements are distantly related to in the integrases of some of the RNA-mediated elements.",Immunology
7528139,"The widespread expression of angiogenin in different human cells suggests a biological function not only related to angiogenesis. Angiogenin is a secreted polypeptide that induces neovascularization in vivo. The expression of angiogenin by human cells in culture was investigated by using a specific radioimmunoassay and by cDNA hybridization. Angiogenin immunoreactivity was widely but differentially produced by anchorage-dependent growing cells including vascular endothelial cells from saphenous and umbilical veins, aortic smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts (from embryos, new-borns and adults), and tumour cells. Endothelial cells from saphenous veins and the endothelium-derived EA.hy926 cell line released immunoreactivity whatever the stage of the culture, including release at the lag phase, during exponential growth and at the confluent phase. However, the rate of accumulation of angiogenin varied as a function of EA.hy926 cell density. As compared to anchored cells, normal peripheral blood cells and tumour cells of myelomonocytic and megakaryocytic origin did not noticeably secrete angiogenin except at low levels. A myeloma cell line supernatant contained as much angiogenin cross-reactivity as did anchored cells, while four tumour T-cell lines expressed the cross-reactivity at different levels, i.e. from undetectable levels to a high level. A 0.9-kb angiogenin messenger RNA was detected by Northern-blot analyses in a variety of representative cells correlating with the presence of immunoreactivity in the cell-culture media. The widespread expression pattern of angiogenin suggests a physiological function that is not restricted to the neovascularization process.",Immunology

In T lymphocytes, several proteins are rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine after stimulation. In this study we examine the ability of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins from Jurkat T cells stimulated by CD2 or T cell receptor (TcR)-CD3 to interact with the src homology 2 (SH2) domains from p56lck (Lck). Our data show that the patterns are different depending on the stimulation. The specificity of the interactions was assessed by blocking experiments with high affinity phosphotyrosine [Y(P)] peptides. Phosphorylation experiments suggest that one or several kinases are able to interact with the SH2 from Lck. On the other hand, full length Lck overexpressed in Sf9 cells, which is tyrosine-phosphorylated at least on two sites, can interact in vitro with the SH2 from Lck, phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma 1, p85 (the regulatory subunit of phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase (PI3K)) and Nck and with the full length Grb2.

To obtain some ideas about prevention of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), we examined the effects of transilast (anti-allergic agent) on migration and proliferation of, and collagen synthesis by, cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from the thoracic aorta of WKY rats. Tranilast was added to culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The cultures were pulse-labeled with 3H-thymidine (TdR) or 3H-proline (Pro). TdR and Pro uptake into VSMC were measured. The effect of tranilast on migration of VSMC was examined by using culture dishes of an original design. We also examined the inhibitory effects of various drugs, such as a Ca antagonist, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, elastase, colchicine, and mitomycin C, on proliferation and migration of VSMC. Our data showed that the inhibitory effects of tranilast on migration and proliferation of, and collagen synthesis by, VSMC were prominent. Maximal percentage inhibition of proliferation, migration and collagen synthesis was 60.8 +/- 2.3%, 52.7 +/- 14.7% and 62.1 +/- 8.1%, respectively. On the other hand, the inhibitory effects of other drugs, with the exception of colchicine and mitomycin C, on proliferation and/or migration of VSMC were not very strong. Although the inhibitory effects of colchicine and mitomycin C were strong in vitro, their clinical usefulness may be limited by systemic side-effects.

The relationships between epitope topography and agonistic/antagonistic effects of anti-TNF receptor type 1 (TNF-R1) antibodies on TNF-alpha cytotoxic activity have been studied. To this purpose various monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the soluble form of TNF-R1 (sTNF-R1) have been generated and characterized. Epitope topography studies identified at least four distinct epitopes located outside (4E10) or within (or close to) the TNF-alpha binding site of urinary sTNF-R1 (7H3, 4C1, 9B11). mAbs 7H3 and 4C1 were able to neutralize the inhibition of human TNF-alpha cytotoxicity on L-M cells by sTNF-R1, while 4E10 was unable. Moreover, 7H3 and 4C1 were able to antagonize the TNF-alpha cytotoxicity on human U937 cells, while they were uneffective on mouse L-M cells, suggesting that these antibodies recognize, in a species-specific mode, also the membrane form of the human receptor. No agonistic effects were observed when these antibodies were used in the absence of TNF-alpha. Epitope topography studies carried out using overlapping decapeptides covering most of the sTNF-R1 sequence showed that residues 143-148 of the fourth cysteine-rich domain of the receptor (FFLREN) contain antigenic determinants recognized by the antagonist antibody 7H3. These results suggest that at least part of residues 143-148 of sTNF-R1 are surface exposed on the soluble as well as on the membrane forms of TNF-R1 and are accessible to TNF-alpha antagonists.",Immunology

The vestibular system is involved in maintaining stable blood pressure and respiration during changes in posture and is essential for eliciting motion sickness-related vomiting. Because the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) participates in the regulation of sympathetic and inspiratory outflow and the triggering of emesis, we tested the hypothesis that this region receives vestibular inputs in cats. In one set of experiments, microinjections of the tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin into the medial and inferior vestibular nuclei labeled projections to the middle and lateral regions of the NTS. In electrophysiological experiments, electrical stimulation of the vestibular nerve modified the firing rates of neurons located in the same regions. Some neurons with vestibular inputs received convergent signals from the abdominal vagus nerve and could potentially mediate motion sickness-related vomiting. Others received convergent baroreceptor inputs and could act as a substrate for some components of vestibulosympathetic reflexes. In contrast, inspiratory neurons in the dorsal respiratory group received little vestibular input, suggesting that vestibulorespiratory reflexes are mediated by cells located elsewhere.",Immunology
7524366,"Angiotensin II maintains, but does not mediate, isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy in rats. The role of angiotensin II (ANG II) in the development of isoproterenol (Iso)-induced cardiac hypertrophy was examined in rats. Iso increased cardiac mass, left ventricular RNA-to-DNA ratio, and the cardiac content of both myosin heavy chain and hydroxyproline in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that Iso-induced cardiac hypertrophy involves growth of both muscle and connective tissue. Cardiac hypertrophy reverted within 11-14 days after cessation of Iso. Propranolol prevented development of Iso-induced cardiac hypertrophy but did not affect the rate of its reversal. The ANG II receptor blocker losartan (Los) did not significantly decrease the hypertrophic response to Iso. Los injected after cessation of Iso dramatically enhanced the reversal of cardiac hypertrophy, even in rats that received Los with Iso during the induction of Iso-induced cardiac hypertrophy. ANG II, injected continuously at a subpressor dose that did not affect heart weight when given alone, inhibited reversal of cardiac hypertrophy when given after cessation of Iso. Los did not significantly affect the induction of the protooncogene c-fos by Iso. We conclude that endogenous ANG II has a major function in maintaining Iso-induced cardiac hypertrophy but does not mediate its induction. This suggests that different interactive stimuli may be required for development of cardiac hypertrophy, i.e., for initiation and for maintenance.",Immunology

Although insulin has been proposed to mediate the dietary regulation of pancreatic amylase, its interaction with diet in the regulation of amylase and lipase is not well understood and was examined in diabetic rats fed diets high in carbohydrate (HC), protein (HP), or fat (HF) and treated with insulin. Diabetes, independent of diet, decreased amylase content (97%; P < 0.0001) and mRNA (90%; P < 0.0001), but insulin only restored amylase content and mRNA to respective dietary control values. Diabetes, independent of diet, also increased lipase mRNA 1.6-fold (P < 0.004) but interacted (P < 0.0003) with diet on lipase content, resulting in opposite effects in HC- (increased 202%) and HF-diabetic rats (decreased 40%). Insulin partially restored lipase content and mRNA to respective dietary control values. Diet, independent of diabetes, regulated amylase content (P < 0.0001) and mRNA (P < 0.0003), which were three- to fourfold greater in HC- than in HF-fed rats, and lipase content (P < 0.001) and mRNA [rat pancreatic lipase 1 (rPL-1), P < 0.04; rPL-3, P < 0.0001], which were 1.8-fold greater in HF- than in HC- or HP-fed rats. Insulin failed to stimulate maximal amylase gene expression in HP- or HF-fed diabetic rats, suggesting that it is necessary, but not sufficient, for this dietary regulation. Differential regulation of lipase activity and mRNA by diet and insulin raises the possibility that lipase gene expression is regulated by a complex interaction of diet and insulin.",Immunology

Anion exchanger (AE) protein-mediated anion exchange contributes to regulation of intracellular pH (pHi), Cl- concentration, and volume in vertebrate cells. We have extended the functional characterization of recombinant AE2-mediated Cl-/HCO3- exchange in single Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the polyoma large T antigen (CHOP cells) of defined transient transfection status using a novel surface marker coexpression vector. Marker expression and detection had minimal effect on the low endogenous Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity of CHOP cells, whereas coexpression of marker with AE2 elevated CHOP cell Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity 16-fold. Between pHi of 7.3 and 7.8, AE2-mediated flux of proton equivalents was activated > 11-fold by increasingly alkaline pHi without reaching saturation. This activation may be secondary to allosteric effects of pHi on AE2, in parallel with the obligatory increase in substrate intracellular HCO3- concentration. Nominal removal of CO2/HCO3- reduced AE2 activity by 90%. Addition of 10% calf serum slowly activated AE2 activity severalfold. This activation was slowly reversed after serum removal.

Improvement rate of subjective rate of subjective symptoms was 52.9%. Obstructive symptoms improved more prominently than irritation symptoms. A significant improvement in flow rate of nomograms for maximum flow rate (MFR) and average flow rate (AFR) accompanied with the decrease in the prostatic weight were observed. However, no changes were observed on the urethral sphincter electromyography and the urethral pressure profile. A significant decrease of maximum cystometric capacity was observed, although the effective cystometric capacity was not changed. The overall improvement rate for urodynamic parameters was 43.7%. A significant decrease in weight and diameter of the prostate was observed. The prostatic weight decreased in 57.1%, and the average reduction rate was 15.4%. The overall improvement rate concerning clinical efficacy evaluating both subjective symptoms and objective parameters was 58.8%. Adverse reactions were observed in 5 cases.

7524008,"Acetaminophen blocks spinal hyperalgesia induced by NMDA and substance P. The hypothesis tested was that inhibition of the L-arginine-nitric oxide (NO) pathway may represent a potential central mechanism of action for acetaminophen (paracetamol). Spinal administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA, 0.5 nmol), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA, 0.1 nmol) or substance P (SP, 0.5 nmol) to the rat provoked a specific behaviour characterized by biting, scratching and licking (BSL). This behaviour was antagonized by pretreatment with acetaminophen for NMDA and SP but not for AMPA. Further, the antinociceptive effect of acetaminophen was readily reversed by administration of the natural substrate for nitric oxide synthase (NOS), L-arginine, but not by D-arginine. This suggests that the analgesic effect of acetaminophen is related to inhibition of NO generation. Potential mechanisms for this may involve NMDA and SP. Our data suggest that a significant portion of the analgesic effect of acetaminophen, when used clinically, may be related to an interaction with the central nervous system L-arginine-NO pathway.",Immunology

7522562,"Sequence dependence of stability for coaxial stacking of RNA helixes with Watson-Crick base paired interfaces. Thermodynamic parameters from UV melting studies are reported for the helix-helix interfaces of coaxially stacked helixes in RNA. The model system consists of a short oligomer binding to a four-nucleotide overhang at the end of a hairpin stem, creating the helix-helix interface. Interfaces containing Watson-Crick base pairs are approximately 1 kcal/mol more stable than the corresponding nearest neighbor interaction in an uninterrupted helix.

7521734,"The transmembrane region of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor: is it an all-helix bundle?. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is the best characterised member of the Ligand-Gated-Ion-Channel family of receptors. In spite of a wealth of data from molecular cloning studies these receptors have so far eluded all attempts at crystallisation; quantitative structural data are few and are at relatively low resolution. The widely accepted current model for the topology of the receptors is that of a pentameric cylindrical bundle that spans the membrane. The disposition of the transmembrane region of the individual subunits is based on hydropathy profiles calculated from sequence data which are interpreted as indicating a common structural motif of four antiparallel alpha-helices, M1 to M4. Until very recently this model has been unquestioned even though there are few direct experimental data to support it. We have constructed models of this key functional region for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, building out from the ion-channel. The model of the basic ion-channel comprises a five helical M2 bundle with a left-handed twist. The remainder of the region (M1, M3, M4) was homology modelled, together with M2, as a four helix antiparallel bundle per subunit, using the crystal structure of myohaemerythrin as a template. The models strongly suggest that the four helix bundle model is inappropriate and that recent suggestions of a mixed motif of helix and sheet may better accommodate the existing data.",Immunology
7521688,"Rapid activation of the STAT3 transcription factor by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a glycoprotein that stimulates proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells of neutrophils by signaling through its receptor (G-CSFR). Although the G-CSFR belongs to the cytokine receptor superfamily, which lacks an intracellular kinase domain, G-CSF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins is critical for its biologic activities. We report here that JAK1 and JAK2 tyrosine kinases are tyrosine phosphorylated in response to G-CSF induction. We also demonstrate that the DNA-binding protein STAT3 (also called the acute-phase response factor [APRF], activated by interleukin-6) is an early target of G-CSF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. G-CSF induces two DNA-binding complexes; the major complex contains tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 protein and the minor complex appears to be a heterodimer of the STAT1 (previously p91, a component of DNA-binding complexes activated by interferons) and STAT3 proteins. Antiphosphotyrosine antibody interferes with the DNA binding activity of activated STAT3, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 is important for the DNA binding activity. These results identify a signal transduction pathway activated in response to G-CSF and provide a mechanism for the rapid modulation of gene expression by G-CSF.",Immunology

The efficiency of immobilization depended on the volume of the polar phase in heptane, pH, and molarity of the bicarbonate buffer in reversed micelles, as well as on the process duration. The catalase covalently immobilized on cellulose membranes in reversed micelles was ten times more active compared to that immobilized on the same carrier in aqueous medium.

The sensitivity of Escherichia coli strains to 80% normal human serum (NHS) and the relative importance of the classical and alternative complement pathways was assessed in relation to K1, K5, and O antigen carriage. Strains of each of the common O-serogroups, O1, O2, O4, O6, O7, O9, O18 and O75, smooth strains not typable (NT) with these antisera and auto-agglutinable (AA) strains were studied. Of the 166 strains studied, 37 carried the K1 antigen and 45 the K5 antigen. The variation in sensitivity to NHS between different O-serogroups reported previously was confirmed. Although carriage of the K1 and K5 antigens varied with O-serogroup, this did not explain the differences either between or within O-serogroups. Strains with the K1 or K5 antigen were significantly more resistant to the alternative complement pathway than strains without these antigens. However, this appeared to be more related to the O-serogroups with which they were associated; 37 of 50 O2, O4, O6 and AA strains were affected by complement through both pathways but 20 of 30 O7, O18 and O75 strains were affected by the classical pathway alone and 16 of 20 O9 and NT strains were affected by the alternative pathway alone.",Immunology
7515958,"Plasma amylase levels as a marker of disease severity in an isogenic murine model of paracoccidioidomycosis. Survival patterns after peritoneal infection with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis vary according to the mouse strain and to the virulence of the fungal isolate. It has previously been observed that a significant increase in plasma amylase levels occurs only when susceptible mice (B10.A) were infected with a virulent isolate (Pb18). In order to verify if increased amylase levels correlate with susceptibility to P. brasiliensis infection, 12 mouse strains with different susceptibility patterns to this fungus were investigated after infection with Pb18. When compared with their respective controls, C57BI/6, B10D2/oSn, B10D2/nSn, C3H/HeJ, B10.A and BALB/c mice showed a conspicuous amylase increase and AKR, (NZB x NZW)F1, CBA/J, (A/Sn x B10.A)F1, A/Sn and DBA/2 absence of alteration. The influence of the infecting fungal isolate on this enzymatic parameter was investigated using B10.A mice and fungal isolates with diverse degrees of virulence. When compared with their non-infected controls, mice infected with Pb45 or Pb47 showed a very high amylase increase, with Pb44 or Pb18 a high one and with Pb50 or Pb265 a discrete increase. On the whole, there is an inverse correlation between survival times after infection and the increase in amylase levels. Thus, measurement of plasma amylase is a satisfactory parameter to evaluate the severity of paracoccidioidomycosis in mice.",Immunology

This study explores the organization of the striatal projections from the rostral caudate nucleus to the output nuclei of the basal ganglia in the cat. Tracer deposits were stereotaxically injected in different dorsoventral, mediolateral, and rostrocaudal sectors of the head of the caudate nucleus using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated with wheat germ agglutinin (HRP-WGA) either alone or mixed with free HRP. After the injections, a detailed analysis of the terminal labeling was carried out within the globus pallidus (GP), the entopeduncular nucleus (Ep), and the substantia nigra (SN) pars reticulata (SNR). Our findings illustrate how different dorsoventral, mediolateral, and rostrocaudal parts of the rostral caudate nucleus project primarily to similarly positioned but spatially segregated parts of GP. The striatoentopeduncular pathway was also organized topographically, but there was overlapping by projections from different parts of the rostral caudate nucleus. Areas of topographical segregation and zones of overlap were detected in the organization of the striatal projections from the rostral caudate nucleus to SNR. These results raise the possibility of distinct striatal actions upon different sectors of the output nuclei of the basal ganglia and, indirectly, upon their targets in the thalamus and brainstem.",Immunology

We studied the effects of clindamycin and a combination of clindamycin and pyrimethamine on the proliferation of Toxoplasma gondii in cultured mammalian cells and the effect of clindamycin on the parasite's RNA and protein syntheses. Infected macrophages were treated for 48 h with clindamycin or a combination of clindamycin and pyrimethamine, and the 50% inhibitory concentrations for parasite growth were 32.50 +/- 1.30 and 10.78 +/- 0.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. A modified susceptibility assay was also used to measure the effect of low concentrations of clindamycin on T. gondii. Macrophages and bovine turbinate cells were infected with low numbers of tachyzoites and were exposed to low concentrations of clindamycin for 5 days. In these systems, a concentration of 10 ng of clindamycin per ml inhibited 50% of the growth of the parasite in macrophages, while it completely prohibited the growth of the parasite in epithelial cells. When free tachyzoites were preexposed to clindamycin for 4 h, the reduction of parasite infectivity was proportional to the amount of drug; 100 ng of clindamycin per ml reduced the infectivity of T. gondii to 46.5% +/- 8.5% of that of the untreated control. A concentration of 40 micrograms of clindamycin per ml reduced protein synthesis by 56.2% +/- 6.0% but had no effect on RNA synthesis after a 4-h exposure of free tachyzoites of T. gondii to the drug. Our results show that long-term exposure to low concentrations of clindamycin reduces the level of replication of T. gondii, that clindamycin affects the protein synthesis of free parasites, and that clindamycin impairs the ability of tachyzoites to infect host cells.",Immunology
7505012,"Hyaluronic acid-induced lymphocyte signal transduction and HA receptor (GP85/CD44)-cytoskeleton interaction. The purposes of this study are to characterize the binding of hyaluronic acid (HA) to mouse T lymphoma cells, to measure changes in intracellular Ca2+ after HA binding, to elucidate the interaction between the HA receptor, GP85(CD44), and ankyrin in the membrane skeleton, and finally to correlate these events with HA receptor patching/capping and cell adhesion to HA. First, we established an in vivo assay using [3H]HA to measure the binding of HA to mouse T lymphoma cells, and found that the binding of [3H]HA to these cells is readily inhibited by the addition of anti-GP85(CD44) antibody suggesting that GP85(CD44) is the HA receptor. Next, we examined various signal transducing events that occur after HA binds to its receptor on mouse T lymphoma cells. The results of these studies indicate that the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ (as measured by Fura-2 fluorescence) begins to increase within seconds, and reaches a maximal level 5 min after the addition of HA to the cells. After this increase of intracellular Ca2+, HA induces both its receptors, GP85(CD44), to form patched/capped structures, and cell adhesion to HA-coated plates. Furthermore, we have determined that GP85(CD44) binds directly and specifically to ankyrin (Kd approximately 1.94 nM) in a saturable manner; and that ankyrin is preferentially accumulated underneath the HA-induced GP85(CD44) capped structures. The Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, was found to stimulate HA-induced receptor capping and adhesion while EGTA (a Ca2+ chelator), nefedipine/bepridil (Ca2+ channel blockers), W-7 (a calmodulin antagonist), and cytochalasin D (a microfilament inhibitor), but not colchicine (a microtubule disrupting agent), inhibit HA-induced receptor redistribution and adhesion to HA-coated plates. These findings strongly suggest that ankyrin plays an important role in linking the HA receptor, GP85(CD44), to the membrane-associated actomyosin contractile system during hyaluronic acid-mediated lymphocyte activation.",Immunology
7504992,"Activation of MAP kinases, pp90rsk and pp70-S6 kinases in mouse mast cells by signaling through the c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase or Fc epsilon RI: rapamycin inhibits activation of pp70-S6 kinase and proliferation in mouse mast cells. The high-affinity receptor for IgE, Fc epsilon RI, represents the major cell surface structure through which mast cells express immunologically specific secretory function. By contrast, the stem cell factor receptor (SCFR), which is encoded by c-kit, is essential for normal mast cell development. The signaling pathways initiated by the stimulation of mast cells through the Fc epsilon RI, which lacks intrinsic kinase activity, and the SCFR, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family, generally have been regarded to be distinct. We report here that mouse mast cells stimulated either with SCF or with IgE and specific antigen exhibit a remarkably similar pattern of activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), 90 kDa-S6 kinases (pp90rsk), and pp70-S6 kinases (pp70-S6K). These results indicate that all three families of protein kinases are associated with the cell surface receptor-dependent activation of secretion, as well as proliferation, in mast cells. We also show that the immunosuppressant rapamycin, but not FK506, can inhibit both SCF-dependent pp70-S6 kinase activation and SCF-dependent proliferation in mouse mast cells, without suppressing IgE- and antigen-dependent mediator release. These findings suggest that the activation of pp70-S6 kinase represents an important link in the stimulation of cell proliferation by SCF. Our results also indicate that the intracellular signaling pathways initiated by stimulation of mast cells through the Fc epsilon RI or the SCFR exhibit more overlap than has previously been appreciated.",Immunology

Here we present evidence that distinct 'Ia-like' antigens are found on different haematopoietic cells. Approximately half of the Ia-like molecules expressed by B cells and activated T cells have an 'epitope' which is unique to lymphocytes and is not detectable on the Ia-like molecules of haematopoietic precursors or monocytes. This kind of lineage-restricted variation in Ia expression is a potential basis for selective compartmentalization and regulation of DR-associated function.",Immunology

We investigated an in vitro method to produce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) against HTLV-I-infected T-cells using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) patients, asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers (AC) and seronegative healthy donors. The PBMC were restimulated repeatedly for 4 weeks with HLA-matched HTLV-I-infected T-cells which had been pretreated at 56 degrees C for 30 min to inactivate infectious HTLV-I. The culture medium included 10-100 units/ml of recombinant lymphokines (rIL-1, rIL-2, rIL-4, rIL-6 and rIL-7) and 10% fetal calf serum in RPMI-1640 medium. The cytotoxic activity was measured against HLA-matched HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines after CD4+ or CD8+ cells were positively panned from the cultured PBMC. The PBMC of ATL, AC and healthy donors were able to produce either CD4+ or CD8+ CTLs against HTLV-I-related antigens (env, gag, p21x, p27rex and p40tax) as well as the antigen(s) of as-yet unknown specificity expressed on HTLV-I-infected T-cells. All the CTLs recognized the specific antigens in the context of either class I or class II HLA types.

EBV-KT activity in the patients was decreased significantly compared with that of controls (P < 0.001) and became increasingly lower as the clinical stage of the disease advanced. EBV-KT activity was changed by treatment, and decreased EBV-KT activity after treatment was clearly related to patient survival. EBV shedding at oropharynx and uterine cervix were also higher in the patients than in the controls (P < 0.01 and < 0.05).

Because results of retropubic I-125 implantation for prostate cancer have been poor, external beam radiation was added postimplant. Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) was used to assess this approach of combined irradiation. Two hundred and thirty-nine patients with clinical Stage T1 or T2 but surgically node-negative prostate cancer were treated. Results were monitored by serial serum PSA evaluation. Positive clinical findings or a rising PSA level defined recurrent disease. With a median follow-up of 45 months (range, 24-120 months), the Kaplan-Meier projected disease free survival rate was 74% at 5 years and 66% at 10 years. Overall at a 60-month minimum follow-up, 77% of patients had a PSA of 0.5 ng/ml or less. This nadir level is highly predictive of a long term disease free survival, significantly better than pretreatment PSA, grade, or clinical Stage T1 or T2. The PSA-monitored disease free survival rate after combination irradiation appears comparable with that after radical prostatectomy and perhaps superior to that after external-beam radiation. This effect was achieved even though lower-than-usual doses of radiation from both sources were administered. The combination of an I-125 implant followed by external-beam radiation produces high doses within the prostate and, to a lesser extent, in the periprostatic tissue. Additive and synergistic effects from simultaneous irradiation may be responsible for these results.",Immunology

An experimental approach was developed that allowed recording of neurophysiological activity from single putative cochlear efferents in the auditory brain stem of anesthetized chickens with the use of glass micropipettes. The aim of this study was to study spontaneous and tone-evoked activity from single efferent neurons in the chick and to compare their properties with those of other vertebrate hair cell organs. Because the birds, like mammals, have a complex hearing organ with different hair cell types and different afferent and efferent innervation, the purpose of this study was also to determine whether different types of efferents exist. 2. In the same electrode penetrations, putative trapezoid fibers were also isolated. In addition, the penetration angle permitted recordings from units in both cochlear nuclei, nucleus magnocellularis and nucleus angularis (probably mostly cochlear afferents), in the same animal. This allowed monitoring of the auditory sensitivity of the individual animal during the experiment. With the use of physiological criteria, it was possible to distinguish between trapezoid fibers and putative cochlear efferents. Possible alternative origins of the responses described are discussed. 3. Tuning curve characteristics of putative efferents were determined. They were as sensitive as ascending auditory neurons. Q10 dB values of efferent tuning curves were < 2.5 and thus showed poorer frequency selectivity than ascending fibers; in some cases they covered the entire hearing range of the chicken. 4. Latencies to tone pips were different for ascending neurons and putative efferent units. For trapezoid fibers and neurons from the cochlear nuclei, latencies usually did not exceed 5 ms, whereas latencies of efferents were always longer. 5. Because of the interaural canal that connects both middle ear cavities in birds, the measurement of the lateralization of the efferents was difficult. In any case, the majority of putative cochlear efferents responded more sensitively to sound stimulation of the contralateral side. 6. Of the efferent units, 28% showed no spontaneous activity. The others either showed regular spontaneous activity, or their time-interval histograms showed longer modes than ascending fibers. In general, mean spontaneous activity was lower than in ascending fibers, being < 30 spikes/s. 7. In contrast to reports from mammalian studies, in which efferents only showed on peristimulus time (PST) response pattern to tonal stimuli (chopper), two different response types were found in this study: two excitation types (chopper and primary-like) and one suppression type.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Immunology

Severe combined immunodeficient mice transplanted with human organs (SCID-hu mice), provide a unique in vivo model for studying human intrathymic T cell selection and development of tolerance. In vivo administration of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) to SCID-hu mice causes intrathymic clonal deletion of SEB-specific V beta+ T cells that occurs already at the immature CD4+8+ double positive stage. The expression of activation markers such as CD25, CD71, and HLA-DR was specifically increased on V beta+ T cells responding to SEB. The remaining SEB-specific human T cells that had not been deleted in vivo failed to proliferate when rechallenged with SEB in vitro. These SEB-specific T cells that were rendered anergic in vivo had a unique cytokine production profile. They failed to produce IL-2, which correlated with the lack of proliferation of these cells. In addition, they failed to produce TNF-alpha. However, the anergized T cells synthesized considerable amounts of IFN-gamma, granulocyte-macrophage CSF and IL-10 after SEB stimulation. This clonal anergy can be completely reversed in vitro by stimulating the SEB-specific cells in the presence of exogenous IL-2 or by triggering of the CD28/CTLA-4 activation pathway. Under these stimulation conditions, anergic T cells produced levels of IL-2 and TNF-alpha that were comparable to their non-anergized counterparts, whereas the levels of granulocyte-macrophage CSF, IL-10 and IFN-gamma production were even higher. Collectively, these data demonstrate that in vivo administration of SEB to SCID-hu mice leads to activation, deletion, and anergy of SEB-specific human thymocytes and that the production of IL-2 and TNF-alpha is selectively switched off in these anergic T cells.",Immunology

In the present study, various treatments before immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections were compared, including proteolytic enzymes and microwave antigen retrieval in various solutions. Sections of normal cervical and skin tissue were stained in a three-step immunoperoxidase method, employing a broad panel of MAbs against chain-specific keratins 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 and pankeratin. Using microwave heating, Target Unmasking Fluid (TUF), Antigen Retrieval Solution (ARS), a simple detergent solution (DET), PBS, and distilled water (MiQ) were compared. Microwave heating in PBS or MiQ strongly improved staining results. Moreover, microwave pre-treatment in TUF or DET gave excellent and specific staining with the majority of MAbs tested, comparable with or even better than staining obtained on frozen sections. Using microwave antigen retrieval, tissue morphology remained optimal, and only in a very limited number of MAbs did immunoreactivity on paraffin sections fail to be restored. Proteolytic pre-treatment with trypsin, pepsin, or pronase gave moderate to strong staining with some of the MAbs. Other MAbs, for which microwave pre-treatment was able to restore the loss of immunoreactivity, failed to give appropriate staining with proteolytic pre-treatment.

Clinical improvement occurred in 27/31 sites (87%). Acute side effects were mild, and no late side effects were recorded. Median survivals from diagnosis were: 39 months for patients with primary tumors of the lung, 33 months for patients with brain metastases, and 32 months for patients with hepatic involvement. Patients with the carcinoid syndrome responded in 19/22 sites (86%) compared with 8/9 sites (89%) for patients without the syndrome (P = not significant). Radiation therapy can achieve symptomatic palliation for patients with metastatic/unresectable malignant carcinoid tumors, and it is well tolerated. Clinical improvement occurs after irradiation in patients with or without the carcinoid syndrome.",Immunology

7533476,"Study of the activation mechanism of adriamycin on rat mast cells. Adriamycin (ADR) induces nonimmunological and noncytotoxic histamine release from peritoneal and pleural rat mast cells. This secretion is unaffected by the pretreatment with pertussis toxin, cholera toxin and benzalkonium chloride. Histamine release induced by compound 48/80, was markedly inhibited by pertussis toxin, cholera toxin, benzalkonium chloride and neuraminidase. The ADR dose-response curve is significantly shifted to the right when cells were preincubated with the unspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX. The activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with the phorbol esther TPA increases the response to ADR, while PKC inhibition with trifluoperazine decreases histamine release. The pretreatment of mast cells with okadaic acid did not modify the response to ADR. These results suggest that ADR elicits histamine release with a mechanism notably different from compound 48/80.",Immunology

Small cell carcinomas are fairly common neoplasms in the lung, but tumors featuring similar histological profiles may occur in extrapulmonary organs. Three cases of small cell carcinomas occurring in the prostate (case 1), stomach (case 2), and pancreas (case 3) are presented. Production of hormones was demonstrated immunohistochemically in all cases. In case 2 alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was elevated in the serum and observed immunohistochemically in tumor cells. Production of AFP is a distinctive feature, which has not been reported in the pulmonary and extrapulmonary cases of small cell carcinoma. Amplification and/or expression of myc gene family have been suggested to be related to the prognosis of pulmonary small cell carcinoma. Amplification of myc genes was not detected in any of our cases, but c-myc protein was demonstrated immunohistochemically in tumor cells of case 1.",Immunology
7533083,"CD28 functions as an adhesion molecule and is involved in the regulation of human IgE synthesis. Activated T cells induce IgE switching in B cells via a combination of lymphokines and direct T:B cell contact. As CD28-deficient mice have reduced basal levels of IgG1 and IgG2a and diminished Ig class switching, we investigated whether the CD28/B7.1 (CD80) ligand pairing might also be involved in human IgE regulation. Co-incubation of an allergen-specific, human T cell clone with tonsillar B cells caused a marked up-regulation of CD28 expression, whereas, in contrast, CD45 RB expression was unaffected. To test whether blocking the CD28: B7.1 interaction affected IgE synthesis, a dialyzed anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was added to cultures containing tonsillar B cells, pre-activated T cell clones and interleukin-4. Anti-CD28 treatment caused a reproducible, dose-dependent inhibition of IgE, but not IgG synthesis that was accompanied by a visible decrease in cell aggregate formation. Conversely, an anti-B7.1 mAb had no effect in this system. The effect of blocking CD28-ligand interactions on lymphocyte adhesion was formally assessed on human T cell clones and B cell lines using dual intracellular staining and flow cytometry. Co-incubation with an anti-CD28 mAb, but not control IgG or anti-B7.1 mAb, resulted in a marked impairment of conjugate formation that correlated well with T cell surface expression of CD28. Using this system we found that an anti-CTLA-4 mAb but not an anti-B7.2 mAb inhibited T:B cell conjugate formation. Lastly, in addition to a direct effect of anti-CD28 mAb on conjugate formation, 14-day culture of T and B cells in the presence of anti-CD28 caused a marked decrease of ICAM-1 (CD54) expression on aggregated lymphocytes. In contrast, LFA-1 (CD18) expression was unaffected. We, therefore, conclude that the T cell co-stimulatory molecule CD28 is involved in the regulation of IgE synthesis in vitro. CD28 may act to a limited extent as an adhesion molecule, though apparently not by pairing with B7.1 or B7.2. It is more likely that ligation of CD28 under certain conditions modulates the expression of other T and B cell surface molecules.",Immunology

Both drugs preferentially suppressed the tonic generalized extension and prolonged the latency for the onset of each parameter, suggesting NO has a significant effect on the PTZ-induced seizure.",Immunology
7532981,"Recognition of cryptic sites in human and mouse laminins by rat osteoclasts is mediated by beta 3 and beta 1 integrins. Laminins may be encountered by osteoclasts and their precursors in basement membranes when they migrate from periosteal vasculature during skeletal development and in pathological situations. We have examined the recognition by osteoclasts of intact laminins and their proteolytic derivatives, and analysed the mechanism of adhesion. Rat osteoclasts fail to bind intact mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) laminin (3% adhesion relative to adhesion to foetal calf serum proteins) and bind only weakly to native human placental laminin (13%) or human merosin (9%). Pepsin treatment of native mouse EHS and human laminins increased osteoclast adhesion. Rat osteoclasts adhered to mouse EHS laminin-derived P1 fragment (70%), but failed to bind the E8 fragment, which contains adhesion sites recognised by some integrins. Binding to human and mouse P1 laminins was abolished by treatment with RGD-containing peptides and required divalent cations, but not by YIGSR peptide. Combinations of monoclonal antibodies to rat beta 3 and alpha v integrins reduced binding to P1 fragment by 91% and to human laminin by 72%, demonstrating that the major integrin involved in rat osteoclast adhesion to proteolysed laminin is alpha v beta 3. Antiserum to beta 1 integrin inhibited adhesion to human laminin by 40%, but to P1 fragment by only 8%; this suggests that beta 1 integrins(s) contribute to osteoclast adhesion to human laminin but probably not to P1 fragment. The involvement of alpha v beta 3 integrin was confirmed using a recombinant human alpha v beta 3 solid phase binding assay, alpha v beta 3 bound to mouse P1 fragment and proteolytically digested human laminin, but not intact laminins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology
7532656,"An osmium-free method of epon embedment that preserves both ultrastructure and antigenicity for post-embedding immunocytochemistry. Immunocytochemistry for amino acids with post-embedding gold is compatible with glutaraldehyde fixation, osmication, and embedding in epoxy-based plastics, but immunogold detection of larger molecules in the central nervous system commonly requires special procedures, e.g. minimizing exposure to glutaraldehyde, eliminating osmium, cryosectioning, and/or embedding in acrylic plastics. These make samples more difficult to prepare and view and may compromise structural preservation. We report a new technique, fixing with high levels of glutaraldehyde, replacing osmium with tannic acid followed by other heavy metals and p-phenylenediamine, and embedding in Epon. This method optimizes antigenicity while retaining the structural preservation and convenient handling of standard embedding techniques. Compared to standard Epon embedment, labeling for neuropeptides in brain and spinal cord is improved. Moreover, the present method yields excellent labeling of glutamate receptors (difficult to identify with traditional post-embedding techniques) and enables simultaneous visualization of associated neurotransmitters.",Immunology

Expression of cytokeratins 7, 8, 10, 14, 18 and 19 was studied in 48 cases of advanced (stage II and III) squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix. Despite of the degree of differentiation, the expression of simple epithelia cytokeratins 8 (72.9%) and 19 (97.9%) was high. A subset of eight (16.6%) predominantly poorly differentiated tumours had the expression restricted to simple epithelia pattern (cytokeratin 7 and/or 8 and 18 and/or 19). In twenty cases (41.7%) the cytokeratin 14 was added to this pattern, representing an intermediate differentiation level, while the other twenty tumours, usually exhibiting more pronounced squamous differentiation had the most complete cytokeratin pattern including class 10. This grouping was of no prognostic significance but might represent a valuable tool in the classification of cervical squamous cell carcinoma.",Immunology

This method, using Fast Blue B salt and 1-naphthol, has been applied on paraffin sections of grasshopper testis and rabbit trachea, as well as on horse blood smears. Microscopic observation under bright field illumination revealed the expected purple staining of protein-rich cell and tissue structures, which also showed a strong red fluorescence under ultraviolet, violet, violet-blue and green exciting light. Some weakly stained cell components (e.g., meiotic spindles) were easily visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Control preparations lacking either the tetrazonium or naphthol treatment, and spectroscopic studies on the bisazo dye produced in vitro (showing an emission peak at 660 nm) confirmed that the red fluorescence of stained structures arises from the protein-tetrazonium-naphthol reaction product formed in situ.",Immunology

Sixty percent of adults with non-severe malaria had immunoreactive levels of P-selectin above 200 ng/ml (the maximum recorded for any normal healthy adult in the assay) and 86% of all African children with malaria had concentrations above normal irrespective of their clinical categorization, and most exceeded the maximum limits of the assay (> 640 ng/ml). There was no correlation between P-selectin levels and parasitemia. These results raise the possibility that elevated soluble P-selectin in malaria may have an important beneficial anti-inflammatory function.",Immunology
7531595,"Adrenergic and non-adrenergic spinal projections of a cardiovascular-active pressor area of medulla oblongata: quantitative topographic analysis. A cardiovascular-active pressor area of medullary reticular formation was defined by mapping changes in arterial blood pressure produced by microinjections of the neuroexcitatory amino acid, L-Glutamate (L-Glu). Sites where L-Glu provoked pressor responses larger than 10 mmHg were localized to a rostral longitudinal cell column of the nucleus reticularis rostroventrolateralis (n.RVL) extending 450 microns posteriorly to the facial nucleus. Spinal projections from the ventrolateral medulla were studied with a dual retrograde transport-immunocytochemical method. A striking correspondence was observed between the ventrolateral pressor area (VLPA) of n.RVL and rostrocaudal distribution of a circumscribed population of thoracic reticulospinal neurons containing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)- or phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT)_immunoreactivity. Quantitative analysis revealed that 72% of the total number of retrogradely labeled neurons within the active area were immunocytochemically positive for TH; 28% of the reticulospinal projection cells were immunonegative. Deposits of L-Glu and dye through the same micropipettes verified a consistent correlation of vasopressor sites and the rostral subset of catecholaminergic neurons. Since comparable numbers of cell bodies in the VLPA contain TH and PNMT all are presumed to be adrenergic. At levels of n.RVL immediately adjacent to the VLPA commencing at a level 450 microns caudal to the facial nucleus, sites were unresponsive to Glu-stimulation or vasodepressor. At these levels, only non-adrenergic reticulospinal neurons project to cervical or thoracic spinal segments. We conclude that the VLPA is highly restricted to a narrow column of n.RVL < 0.5 mm in length and corresponds precisely with a population of predominantly adrenergic thoracic reticulospinal neurons that project exclusively to sympathoadrenal preganglionic motoneurons [cf 46]. These findings corroborate the idea that an adrenergic-spinal pathway may play a role in controlling sympathetic outflow.",Immunology
7531161,"Intercellular channels in teleosts: functional characterization of two connexins from Atlantic croaker. Gap junction channels, composed of protein subunits termed connexins, are believed to play a critical role in the process of oocyte differentiation and maturation. We have used the paired Xenopus oocyte assay to characterize functionally two connexin genes, connexin-32.2 and connexin-32.7, recently cloned from the ovary of the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonia undulatus), a species that has emerged as a useful model to study the process of maturation of the ovarian follicle. We have found that, while both connexin proteins were expressed at comparable levels in Xenopus oocytes, only one, connexin-32.2, was functionally competent to induce the formation of intercellular channels. Connexin-32.2 channels exhibited voltage-dependent closure that was similar to, but distinct from that of previously characterized mammalian connexins. In addition, the silent connexin-32.7 was unable to functionally interact with connexin-32.2, either in heterotypic channels or as dominant negative inhibitor. Because connexin-32.2 expression is strikingly regulated during oocyte maturation, these data provide further evidence for a role of intercellular channels in the control of oocyte-follicular cell interactions.",Immunology

The effects of aspirin and indomethacin on the ventricular arrhythmias produced by ligation (ischaemia) and unligation (reperfusion) of the circumflex branch of the left coronary vessel were evaluated in fifty male rabbits weighing 1.5-2 kg. Pretreatment of animals with aspirin (50 mg/kg i/v) suppressed all arrhythmias during ischaemia. Low dose of aspirin (12.5 mg/kg i/v) produced no mortality. Indomethacin (2.5 mg/kg) was unable to control ischaemia and reperfusion-induced ventricular arrhythmias. However, higher doses of indomethacin (50 mg/kg) suppressed ischaemia-induced arrhythmias to some extent but the mortality rate was increased (37%). Fragment of ventricular fibrillation was zero during ischaemia after treatment with aspirin and indomethacin but reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation was not controlled by any of these drugs. Aspirin (12.5 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg) and indomethacin (2.5 mg/kg) significantly suppressed ischaemia--induced tachyarrhythmias while reperfusion induced tachyarrhythmias were suppressed only by aspirin.

Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to examine the regional binding characteristics of a diverse group of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor channel blockers that varied in potency 10(5)-fold. Full competition curves were generated in each of six brain regions for 11 different compounds. MK-801 was the most potent compound studied, with an IC50 of approximately 10 nM in the forebrain regions and 24 nM in the cerebellar granule cell layer (p < 0.05). The binding affinities of nine of the 11 compounds examined were significantly different in cerebellar granule cell layer than in forebrain regions. In addition, the apparent Hill slopes of five of the compounds were significantly different in cerebellum compared with forebrain. That the rank order of drug potencies in cerebellar diverges from that in forebrain suggests that cerebellar NMDA-receptor ion channels differ pharmacologically from those in forebrain. There was a general trend that drugs known to be well tolerated in humans (remacemide hydrochloride and its metabolites, amantadine, budipine, and memantine) had lower affinities than compounds with severe neurobehavioral or psychotomimetic effects. Moreover, all of the compounds known to be well tolerated in humans had a significantly higher affinity in the cerebellum than in forebrain regions, in contrast to MK-801, 1-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]-piperidine hydrochloride (TCP), phencyclidine (PCP), and ketamine, which had lower affinities in cerebellum. Our results are consistent with the notion that low affinity (rapid kinetics) and, possibly, subunit specificity (as indicated by distinct regional pharmacologies) may be important determinants of the clinical tolerability of NMDA-receptor channel blockers.",Immunology

One hundred and twenty-four localized prostate cancer patients operated on at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) since 1975 were identified. The sample was optimized for evaluation of prostate cancer progression. Based upon accurate clinical histories, these radical prostatectomy patients included 50 progressors and 74 non-progressors using appearance of serum PSA as an indication of recurrence (mean follow-up = 8.6 +/- 1.8 years, range 7-15 years). All patients included in the study had no involvement of their seminal vesicles or lymph nodes at the time of prostatectomy. Average time to progression was 3.6 +/- 2 years, range of 1-8 years. Using paraffin-embedded specimens, several five micron sections were cut and placed on Probe-On slides; one slide was H&E-stained and the other was Feulgen-stained. The H&E and Feulgen-stained slides were screened and ""dotted"" by pathologists at JHH and CytoDynostics, Inc. A CAS-200 Image analysis system (Cell Image Systems, Elmhurst, IL) equipped with a Cell Measurement Program version 1.2 beta, was used to capture the Feulgen-stained images and to perform the calculations. From the ""dotted"" areas, 150 cancer cells were selected for measurement of DNA content and 27 nuclear morphometric shape and size factors, including 21 Markovian chromatin texture variables. Additional sections were used for immunochemistry staining with an alkaline phosphatase streptavidin-biotin complex stain to detect and quantitate cancer cells binding monoclonal antibodies directed against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and HER-2/neu antigen. All data were entered into a statistical program (STATA) for further analysis and univariate and multivariate statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression and its stepwise variant. The biomarkers of greatest utility to detect progressors when analyzed univariately included post-operative Gleason score (p = < 0.0001), HER-2/neu antigenicity (p = 0.0147), CAS-200 DNA ploidy (p = 0.008), and twelve Markovian nuclear texture and shape features (p = < 0.0001), whereas PCNA (p = 0.160) failed. The optimal set of nuclear morphometry progression tumor features were selected using backward stepwise logistic regression estimate analysis which drops variables due to collinearity. Although post-operative Gleason score is a strong univariate predictor of progression, DNA ploidy and HER-2/neu contributed significantly to further stratification of higher risk groups within the low Gleason score subpopulation. The best Markovian features combined with post-operative Gleason score generated sensitivity = 90%, specificity = 96%, positive predictive value = 94%, negative predictive value = 93% and the area under the receiver operator curve was 0.975.",Immunology
7529821,"Intracellular pH changes produced by glutamate uptake in rat hippocampal slices. 1. The mean intracellular pH in area CA1 of rat hippocampal slices was monitored fluorescently after loading the cells with the dye BCECF-AM. 2. Including L-glutamate in the solution superfusing the slice led to the intracellular pH becoming more acid. This acidification had a roughly Michaelis-Menten dependence on the superfused glutamate concentration with a half-maximal dose around 200 microM: this value must overestimate the glutamate concentration at most of the cells, which will be reduced by uptake. 3. The glutamate-evoked acidification was not significantly reduced by blockers of glutamate-gated ion channels [6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3- dione (CNQX) and D-aminophosphonovalerate (APV)] nor by blockers of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)- and glycine-gated channels (picrotoxin and strychnine), and so was not produced by H+ entry through alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channels nor by HCO3- exit through the chloride channels controlled by GABA or glycine. 4. The glutamate-evoked acidification was not reduced by tetrodotoxin (TTX), ruling out the possibility of it being generated by action potentials. It was also unaffected by saturation of presynaptic L-amino-4-phosphonobutanoate (AP4) receptors with AP4. 5. In the presence of blockers of glutamate-, GABA-, and glycine-gated channels, the acidification showed the pharmacology of glutamate uptake and was reduced by a glutamate uptake blocker. 6. The glutamate-evoked acidification showed an ion dependence similar to that of glutamate uptake. It was abolished by removal of extracellular sodium and was reduced by raising the extracellular potassium concentration. It was unaffected by blockers of Na+/H+ exchange (amiloride) and Na+/HCO3- cotransport [4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS)] and so was not produced by the Na+ influx accompanying glutamate uptake changing the activity of these carriers. 7. These data show that the glutamate uptake carrier acidifies hippocampal cells, possibly because it transports a pH-changing anion out of the cell as in salamander glial cells. Glutamate uptake may thus contribute to activity-induced pH changes in the nervous system.",Immunology
7529549,"Origin and biology of a testicular Wilms' tumor. A pure triphasic testicular Wilms' tumor, without teratomatous elements, was studied using multiple techniques. Carcinoma in situ (CIS), the characteristic precursor of testicular germ cell tumors of adults (TGCTs), was found in the adjacent parenchyma. Flow cytometric analysis showed a single hypotriploid tumor stem line. Karyotyping of the tumor revealed some numerical and structural abnormalities, including an i(12p), the chromosomal marker of TGCTs. In situ hybridization supported the karyotypic findings, and showed a similar numerical distribution in CIS and the tumor. Molecular analysis of the tumor illustrated that all short arms of chromosome 12, including i(12p), were of maternal origin. No 12q deletions were detected. In spite of complete loss of the paternal 11p13 band, the zinc finger regions and exons 2 and 6 of the WT1 gene contained no aberrations. Therefore, this tumor suppressor gene is not inactivated due to aberrations in the studied regions. In addition, all four WT1 alternative transcripts were expressed in the tumor. No aberrations were found in chromosomal bands 11p15.5, 16q22.1, and 16q24. Both parental alleles of the human imprinted genes H19 and IGF2 were expressed in the tumor.

7529329,"Stem cell factor binding to retrovirus primer binding site silencers. Using modified nuclear lysis and binding conditions, we have examined the binding of an embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell factor, binding factor A, to a stem cell-specific silencer which acts at the DNA level and overlaps the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) proline primer binding site (PBS). Following our protocol, we found that in vitro binding of factor A correlated with the in vivo activity of the M-MuLV silencer. Factor A bound specifically to the wild-type silencer element at room temperature and 30 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C, and bound 10-fold better to the full-length silencer than to a minimal silencer core element. The factor was enriched in nuclear compared with cytosolic extracts and in undifferentiated EC cells compared with differentiated cells in which the silencer is nonfunctional. Salt and ion requirements for factor A binding were investigated, and partial purification steps indicated the factor to be a heparin-Sepharose-binding moiety of greater than 100 kDa. To examine possible relationships between silencer and PBS activities, sequences representing phenylalanine, isoleucine, lysine-1,2, lysine-3, methionine, and tryptophan PBS DNA fragments were tested in vivo for stem cell-specific repression of M-MuLV expression and in vitro in DNA binding assays. Of these PBS elements, only the lysine-1,2 PBS DNA fragment showed consistently high levels of repression. Interestingly, the lysine-1,2 PBS DNA fragment also formed a complex with an EC cell factor with characteristics similar to those of factor A. However, the two factors did not cross-compete in binding studies, suggesting that they may be different but related factors. Our results suggest that expression of Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, visna virus, and spumavirus, which use the lysine-1,2 PBS, may be inhibited in undifferentiated stem cells.",Immunology

In studying IgM and IgG antibodies to these polypeptides by Western blot, we found the expected frequency of antibodies to the A protein of the U1RNP specificity and the D protein of the Sm specificity in sera with precipitins to U1RNP and Sm, but also found the frequent occurrence of both IgM and IgG anti-A and D in SLE sera with no precipitins, and in sera with anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/SSB precipitins, but not in sera from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis, scleroderma, or normals. We have studied the sera which bind the A and D polypeptides on Western blot to test their ability to bind native U1RNP (which contain the A and D proteins) in ELISA. The results indicate that most anti-Ro/SSA alone, anti-Ro/SSA, and anti-La/SSB sera as well as SLE sera with no precipitins react preferentially with the denatured A and D proteins. Further study of sera with IgM anti-A and D in Western blot reveals that these sera also frequently contain anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies. These results show that the anti-A and D responses, especially IgM anti-A and D, occur not only in patients with precipitating antibodies to SnRNPs, but in almost half of patients across the lupus spectrum. The extended prevalence of antibodies to the denatured A and D proteins in Western blot is associated with the cross-reaction of antibodies to dsDNA.",Immunology

We have recently reported that a combination of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and bispecific antibodies (BsAb) efficiently lysed autologous and allogeneic leukemic blasts that had surface antigens reactive with the BsAb. The effector cells used in that experiment were peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with interleukin-2 (IL-2) for 2 weeks, with the initial addition of anti-CD3 moAb; these were termed T3-LAK effector cells. In this study, we examined the effects of T3-LAK cells and BsAb on autologous normal CD34+ BM cells in both cytotoxicity and colony formation assays. When T3-LAK cells were incubated with CD34+ BM cells, low levels of cytotoxicity were induced against the CD34+ BM cells and the cytotoxicity was enhanced by the addition of anti-CD3 Fab' x anti-CD 13 Fab' BsAb but not by the addition of anti-CD3 Fab' x anti-CD10 Fab' BsAb. This enhancement appeared to be due to the lysis of CD34+CD13+ BM cells. When T3-LAK cells were preincubated with CD34+ BM cells in the presence or absence of the BsAb and plated for colony assay, neither the T3-LAK cells nor the BsAb affected granulocyte-macrophage or mixed-cell colony formation by CD34+ BM cells. Taken together with our previous finding that T3-LAK cells used in combination with the BsAb markedly inhibited colony formation by leukemic progenitor cells, these results indicate that this combination provides a potential new strategy for CD34+ BM cell purging in autologous BMT.",Immunology

7526544,"Mapping helper virus functions for cucumber mosaic virus satellite RNA with pseudorecombinants derived from cucumber mosaic and tomato aspermy viruses. P-TAV is a strain of tomato aspermy virus (TAV) able to efficiently support the systemic accumulation of some (i.e., B2-satRNA) but not of other (i.e., Ix-satRNA) strains of the satellite RNA (satRNA) of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) in both tobacco and in tomato. As reported for V-TAV, the failure to support the systemic accumulation of Ix-satRNA seems to be due to an inefficient support of its systemic movement. Pseudorecombinants obtained by the exchange of RNAs 1 + 2 between P-TAV and Trk7-CMV, an efficient helper for the systemic accumulation of Ix-satRNA, were assayed for their ability to support the accumulation of CMV-satRNAs in tobacco plants and protoplasts. Pseudorecombinants having RNAs 1 + 2 from CMV supported the systemic movement and accumulation of CMV-satRNA as efficiently as CMV, whereas pseudorecombinants having RNAs 1 + 2 from TAV supported the CMV-satRNA very poorly. Thus, the ability to support the systemic movement and accumulation of CMV-satRNA is determined primarily by RNAs 1 + 2 and not by RNA 3, which is presumed to encode movement functions in the cucumoviruses and only has a minor, modulating effect on the systemic accumulation of satRNA. This suggests that for systemic movement CMV-satRNA has to interact with (the gene products of) RNAs 1 and/or 2 or that these viral RNAs compete with the satRNA for interaction with the coat or other movement proteins.",Immunology

7526537,"Interferon induction by HIV glycoprotein 120: role of the V3 loop. We have studied the mechanism of IFN induction by HIV-1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), using recombinant viral membrane glycoproteins as potential inducers. Whereas 8 nM HIVIIIB-derived gp120 resulted in IFN levels between 80 and 2000 IU/ml with PBMC from different donors, gp120 from the MN strain was not an inducer. Preincubation of HIVIIIB-gp120 with a monoclonal antibody (mAB) to its CD4 binding domain or of PBMC with a mAB to the gp120 binding domain of CD4 abolished IFN induction. Antibodies against the third extracellular domain of CD4 which did not block binding of gp120, however, were also inhibitory. Furthermore, several mABs to the third variable loop (V3) of HIVIIIB-gp120 also blocked IFN induction, suggesting an important role of V3 in this process. This was further supported by the inhibitory action of peptides homologous to complete or partial sequences of V3. We conclude that after binding of gp120 to its CD4 receptor the V3 loop can be positioned close to the membrane of the responder cells by bending of gp120-occupied CD4 at its hinge region between extracellular domains 2 and 3. As a result V3 is able to interact with a V3-specific ""secondary receptor"" on the membranes of these cells. We suggest that it is the latter interaction which triggers IFN induction.",Immunology
7526535,"Analysis of the determinants of the satellite RNA of cucumber mosaic cucumovirus for high accumulation in squash. Ix-satRNA is a 334-nt cucumber mosaic cucomovirus satellite RNA (CMV-satRNA) with the unusual property of accumulating to high levels in host plants of the family Cucurbitaceae. To identify the determinants for this unusual phenotype, recombinant satRNAs were obtained, by in vitro manipulation of full-length cDNA clones between clone-derived Ix5-satRNA and two other CMV-satRNAs that do not accumulate efficiently in squash: D4-satRNA, which differs in 7 positions from Ix5-satRNA, and B21-satRNA, which differs in 45 positions. The analysis of the accumulation in squash of these hybrid satRNAs showed that determinants for high accumulation in squash occur in three molecular domains: nucleotides 1-46 (a C at position 20), 47-185 (a C at position 102), and 185-334 (not identified). None of these determinants seemed to be necessary or sufficient to confer a phenotype of high accumulation in squash. They resulted, or did not result, in such a phenotype according to the sequences that occur in other parts of the satRNA molecule. Not all of the identified determinants were equally affected by sequence context. These results may suggest that the phenotype in squash is determined by the conformation of the satRNA.",Immunology

It is closely related with the biological and human fundamental sciences and with the medical disciplines concerned with the care of old patients. Its issues are ubiquitous and also interest non psychiatrists, particularly geriatricians, internists, neurologists and psychologists. Therefore there is a risk for research to be spread out. As a medicine of synthesis, it must assert itself as a convergence point for the related branches. Its very vast field of research is confronted with particular methodological problems, like the chronological and biological age, the heterogeneity of the population, the polymorbidity. Psychogeriatrics is young and still requires an important involvement in the clinical tasks, in the medico-social coordination and in the teaching to medical and paramedical circles. Rare are centers having the critical mass for developing good research with complete peace of mind, Switzerland is an example of this. An analysis of the 1992 international literature shows a certain scattering of the psychogeriatric themes with a 50% predominance of papers devoted to dementias.

In the advanced stage of tumor palliation is the only remaining therapeutic aim. In a retrospective study covering the period 1984-1992 we analyzed 51 patients who underwent surgery for esophageal or cardia cancer to determine whether palliation by surgery is feasible. We also analyzed morbidity and mortality of peri- and postoperative complications. In 88% we carried out standard esophagectomy consisting of abdomino-thoracic access, gastric interposition with thoracic anastomosis and extramucous pyloromyotomy. In the light of postresection histology, 53% of the operations were potentially curative (UICC stage I and II) [1], 47% palliative (UICC stage III and IV) [1]. Perioperative 30-days mortality was nil, perioperative 30-days morbidity 11% (3 patients developed pneumonia postoperatively, 2 patients with cervical anastomosis developed dehiscence of anastomosis which in both cases healed completely with conservative therapy, while a further patient with cervical anastomosis suffered persistent paralysis of the recurrent nerve. All patients were fully able to feed themselves at the time of discharge. 43% of patients had recurrent dysphagia and 24% underwent endoscopic dilatation. Three-year survival was 26%.

7526447,"Developmentally moderated expressions of the neuropathology underlying schizophrenia. A gradually accumulating body of literature suggests that behavioral dysfunction precedes the onset of the schizophrenic syndrome by many years. Thus, a comprehensive neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia must encompass these early manifestations of dysfunction as well as the postmorbid period. This article draws on previous research findings as well as recently proposed neurodevelopmental models to offer some further hypotheses about the neurodevelopmental process underlying the changing life-course manifestations of the diathesis for schizophrenia. It is proposed that normal maturational events in the central nervous system moderate the behavioral expression of a congenital neuropathology that affects subcortical regions of the brain that are part of multiple neural circuits. Specifically, it is suggested that the diathesis for schizophrenia involves a functional excess of dopamine activity in the basal ganglia that serves to disrupt these circuits. Findings from empirical research suggest a modal developmental trajectory for schizophrenia in which neuromotor dysfunction is most pronounced in early childhood and late in life, whereas florid psychotic symptomatology is most pronounced in late adolescence and early adulthood. The literature on normal central nervous system development suggests that the feedback circuit linking motor cortex with subcortical structures is maximally metabolically activated, relative to other circuits, early and late in the life course. Thus, subcortical dopamine excess may be predominantly expressed in motoric symptoms during these periods. In contrast, late adolescence and early adulthood are marked by low motor cortex metabolic activity relative to other cortical regions, in particular limbic and frontal regions. In addition, hormonal changes appear to result in a maximal activation of the dopamine system during this developmental period. Thus, it is hypothesized that during this period the neural circuitry abnormality will be primarily behaviorally expressed in psychotic symptoms. Some implications of the model for the study of movement abnormalities and psychotic symptoms are discussed.",Immunology

Seven of the twins (30%) who later developed schizophrenia had become permanently different from their cotwins by age 5 years. The early divergence group differed from the others by multivariate tests (p = 0.002) for within-twin pair effects and by univariate tests for physical anomaly scores (p = 0.01), total finger ridge counts (p = 0.001), family history of psychosis (p = 0.004), and serious perinatal complications or low birth weight (p = 0.05).

We now report that the antibody My4, but not LeuM3, reacts with porcine monocytes. Among porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), 14.6% of the cells stain with the CD14 antibody My4, which is similar to the percentage obtained with the antiporcine monocyte antibody 74-22-15. Two-colour immunofluorescence reveals that My4 and 74-22-15 antigens are coexpressed on the same cells, and cell sorter-purified My4+ cells exhibit the morphology of monocytes. Whole blood analysis (which also shows staining of granulocytes) reveals that the average percentage of My4+ monocytes amongst all leucocytes is 5.8% with 580 cells/microliters. Furthermore, porcine peritoneal macrophages (PM) and alveolar macrophages (AM), both stain for My4, with a four-fold lower level on AM. Treatment of cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C decreases My4 staining, but does not affect staining with antibody 74-22-15. Immunoprecipitation with the My4 antibody from surface labelled pig mononuclear cells demonstrates a 54 kDa band similar to human CD14, and Western blotting with pig serum demonstrates two bands similar to the alpha and beta forms of human soluble CD14. Finally, the My4 antibody is capable of blocking lipopolysaccharide- (LPS)-induced interleukin-6 production in isolated PBMC. These data show that the My4 antibody recognizes genuine CD14 on porcine monocytes and macrophages.",Immunology

A generally increased inward (mucosa to serosa) and a decreased outward (serosa to mucosa) permeation of the markers was found in the proximal to distal direction. The inward permeability showed increasing regional differences with decreasing size of the markers. In the absence of the villous epithelium, removed by scraping the intestinal wall, 86% to 62% of the proximal and distal barrier was lost in the inward direction but only 14% to 26% in the outward direction. The intestinal epithelial barrier is more permeable in the outward than in the inward direction, and regional permeability differences exist in a size-dependent fashion. The results suggest two passage routes, one for the smallest molecule, mannitol, and a second for the larger markers in the present size range, both apparently different from the route for macromolecules such as intact proteins.",Immunology

7522293,"IL-4 inhibits the LPS-induced expression of CD14 and monocyte-specific esterase mRNA in MONO-MAC-6 cells. The human MONO-MAC-6 cell line expresses the monocyte-associated differentiation markers CD14 and monocyte-specific esterase (MSE) and can be stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to produce high mRNA levels of monocyte-related cytokines. This similarity to human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMo) renders this cell line a promising model for studies of monocyte activation and differentiation. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is known to act antagonistically to LPS during the activation process of PBMo, inhibiting the production of cytokines. Therefore, this study was designed to compare the effects of IL-4 and LPS on the expression of monocytic markers and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) mRNA on PBMo and the MONO-MAC-6 cell line. IL-4 inhibited the LPS-induced expression of TNF alpha mRNA in PBMo and downregulated the LPS receptor CD14 but it had no influence on MONO-MAC-6 cells regarding these parameters. However, upregulation of CD14 and MSE mRNA expression in the cell line by a 2-day incubation with LPS were inhibited by IL-4. This response to IL-4 after long-term treatment with LPS was seemingly contradictory to the missing reduction of TNF alpha mRNA expression after short-term incubation with LPS. Obviously long-term treatment with LPS made the cells responsive to IL-4. The increase in responsiveness was not due to IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) upregulation, as LPS did not influence the constitutive expression of the IL-4R.",Immunology

In order to more clearly define the status of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in prostate cancer, expression of EGFR transcript and protein was analyzed in paired samples of benign and malignant tissues from 30 radical prostatectomy specimens. Prostate tumors and high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PINs) expressed significantly less EGFR protein than benign tissues or low grade PINs (P < 0.001). Expression of EGFR mRNA was analyzed in a subset of the same samples, and was higher in more prostate tumors than benign specimens (P < 0.05). However, differences in mean mRNA expression between malignant and benign tissues were not significant. EGFR mRNA was expressed at moderate or low levels in equivalent numbers of PIN lesions. These results suggest that, although EGFR mRNA expression is somewhat elevated in prostate tumors, EGFR protein expression may be down-regulated in the same malignant tissues. Furthermore, our data demonstrate phenotypic similarity between prostate tumors and high grade PIN at the level of EGFR protein expression.",Immunology

7520778,"The immunosuppressant rapamycin blocks in vitro responses to hematopoietic cytokines and inhibits recovering but not steady-state hematopoiesis in vivo. The immunosuppressive drug rapamycin suppresses T-cell activation by impairing the T-cell response to lymphokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-4 (IL-4). In addition, rapamycin blocks the proliferative response of cell lines to a variety of hematopoietic growth factors, including interleukin-3 (IL-3), interleukin-6 (IL-6), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and kit ligand (KL), suggesting that it should be a strong inhibitor of hematopoiesis. In this report, we studied the effects of rapamycin on different hematopoietic cell populations in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, rapamycin inhibited the proliferation of primary bone marrow cells induced by IL-3, GM-CSF, KL, or a complex mixture of factors present in cell-conditioned media. Rapamycin also inhibited the multiplication of colony-forming cells in suspension cultures containing IL-3 plus interleukin-1 (IL-1) or interleukin-11 (IL-11) plus KL. In vivo, treatment for 10 to 28 days with high doses of rapamycin (50 mg/kg/d, orally) had no effect on myelopoiesis in normal mice, as measured by bone marrow cellularity, proliferative capacity, and number of colony-forming progenitors. In contrast, the same treatment strongly suppressed the hematopoietic recovery normally seen 10 days after an injection of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 150 mg/kg, intravenously [i.v.]). Thus, rapamycin may be detrimental in myelocompromised individuals. In addition, the results suggest that the rapamycin-sensitive cytokine-driven pathways are essential for hematopoietic recovery after myelodepression, but not for steady-state hematopoiesis.",Immunology

With laser-scan microscopes oncogene amplification and chromosomal aberrations may be measured using fluorescence DNA in situ-hybridization. Of all cytometric parameters obtainable at present, only DNA ploidy is of clinical relevance in transitional cell carcinomas as it can predict the probability of tumor recurrence, -progression and of survival time with high accuracy.

Monoamine-activated alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) has been shown to inhibit beta-nerve growth factor (NGF)-promoted neurite outgrowth and the survival of embryonic sensory and forebrain neurons, whereas normal alpha 2M has little or no such activity. The objective of this study is to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition by monoamine-activated alpha 2M. Methylamine-activated alpha 2M (MA-alpha 2M) and serotonin-activated alpha 2M (5HT-alpha 2M) dose dependently inhibit NGF-promoted neurite outgrowth of the pheochromocytoma PC12 cell and its subline PC12(6-24) which overexpresses human trk protooncogene product, but have no effect on their viability, and this inhibition can be blocked by high concentrations of NGF. The binding of MA-alpha 2M to trk, which is a part of high-affinity NGF receptor, was studied with PC12(6-24) cells and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts expressing trk (trk-3T3). In each case MA-alpha 2M readily forms stable complexes with trk in vivo, whereas normal alpha 2M does not. Both 5HT-alpha 2M and MA-alpha 2M also dose dependently block NGF-promoted autophosphorylation of trk in vivo, whereas normal alpha 2M and plasmin-reacted alpha 2M are inactive or much less active. MA-alpha 2M also blocks NGF-promoted incorporation of 32P from [32P]ATP into trk receptors in vitro. Neither MA-alpha 2M, 5HT-alpha 2M, nor normal alpha 2M, however, blocks either platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated or epidermal growth factor-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the respective receptors. Tyrosine phosphorylation of two of the intracellular substrates, phospholipase C-gamma 1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2, in the NGF-promoted pathways is also dose dependently blocked by MA-alpha 2M. However, by comparison MA-alpha 2M is more effective in inhibiting the activation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 than trk. We conclude that monoamine-activated alpha 2M may block neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival by its specific binding to NGF receptors, thus inhibiting the NGF-promoted activation of intracellular second messenger pathways.",Immunology

Therefore, we decided to assess the usefulness of karyometric analysis in the examination of aspirates from these neoplasms.

These proved to be follicular adenomas (8 cases) and follicular carcinomas (8 cases) on histopathological examination. The following morphometric parameters were measured in 100 nuclei per smear: volume, intersection area, perimeter, convexity coefficient and shape coefficient. We found that: 1) the mean volume and the mean intersection area of thyrocyte nuclei from follicular carcinomas were significantly (p < 0.001) greater than those of nuclei from adenomas or nodular goitres; 2) the mean perimeter of thyrocyte nuclei from follicular carcinomas was significantly greater than the mean perimeter of thyrocyte nuclei from follicular adenomas (p < 0.025) and nodular goitres (p < 0.001); 3) the mean nuclear area of thyrocytes from follicular adenomas was significantly greater than that of thyrocytes from nodular goitres (p < 0.05). Our results show that karyometric analysis can be useful in cytological differentiation of follicular neoplasms.",Immunology

Thirty four sera from: 12 patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), 9 with Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (SCLE) and 13 with Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE) (disseminatus 3, localised 10) were tested for the presence of: (a) anti-thyroglobulin and anti-microsomal autoantibodies (b) anti-Sm/RNP, anti-doublestranded. DNA (anti-ds. DNA), anti-single-Stranded. DNA (anti-ss. DNA), anti-cardiolipin (anti-Cl), anti-SSA, anti-SSB, Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA). T3, T4, TSH levels were also determined. Five patients with SLE (41.6%), 4 with SCLE (44.4%), and 2 with DLE (15.3%) had thyroid autoantibodies and only three of the 41 controls (7.3%). Five patients (14.7%), especially from SLE and SCLE groups, had biochemical hypothyroidism whereas only one had hyperthyroidism. Statistical evaluation for the possible coexistence of thyroid autoantibodies with a panel of lupus characteristic autoantibodies, revealed highly significant correlations with anti-Sm/RNP, IgG (p = 0.003) and anti-ds. DNA, IgM (p = 0.012). It may be concluded, that not only SLE but also SCLE predisposes to autoimmune thyroid disease and the prevalence of the latter is related to a great extent to the subset of the LE spectrum.

7507993,"Pharmacological evidence that flow- and potassium-induced contraction of rabbit facial vein may involve the same calcium entry pathway. Flow-induced contraction depends upon extracellular Ca++, but the underlying Ca++ entry pathway involved is unknown. We chose the rabbit facial vein to carry out this study because, in addition to contracting to a number of pharmacological agents and developing myogenic tone in response to stretch in vitro, flow-induced contraction also can be consistently demonstrated. Our goal was to determined whether the Ca++ entry pathway for flow-induced contraction could be distinguished from that involved in K(+)-, histamine- and stretch-induced contraction through the use of a Ca++ entry activator: Bay K 8644 and the Ca++ entry blockers nifedipine, diltiazem and verapamil and also cobalt and manganese. All four types of contractions studied are dependent on extracellular Ca++ Flow- and K(+)-induced contraction were equally sensitive to inhibition by nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem. Those to histamine and stretch were not. Furthermore, the flow- and K(+)-induced contractions were enhanced equivalently by the calcium channel activator, Bay K 8644, but to a lesser degree than those to histamine and stretch. The inorganic calcium channel blockers, Co++ and Mn++ effected equally flow-, K(+)- and histamine-induced contraction. They were more potent in their inhibition of stretch-induced contraction. Our results suggest that flow- and K(+)-induced contractions depend on a similar Ca++ entry system into vascular smooth muscle: probably a voltage-gated Ca++ entry pathway, which is different from that utilized by histamine and stretch.",Immunology

Seventy patients with previously untreated advanced Hodgkin's disease and without bulky disease were entered in a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing epirubicin in combination with vinblastine, bleomycin, and dacarbazine (EVBD) with a regimen containing mitoxantrone, vinblastine, bleomycin, and dacarbazine (MVBD). Both groups were comparable for the variables of age, sex, stage, and presence of B symptoms and histology. Thirty-one (88%) of EVBD-treated patients achieved a pathologically documented complete remission (CR) compared to the 24 cases (68%) of the MVBD-treated group. After a median follow-up of 36 months, duration of CR is better in the EVBD-treated patients with an actuarial 5-year duration of CR of 80%, statistically different to the MVBD group: 53% (P < 0.01). Both regimens showed the same gastrointestinal toxicity, but the patients treated with the MVBD regimen shown most and severe hematological and cardiac toxicities. Also, biochemical alterations in hepatic test were observed in these patients. The alternative use of epirubicin in combination chemotherapy appears to be as effective in advanced Hodgkin's disease without bulky disease, with reduced clinical toxicity. Mitoxantrone containing regimen was not found to have an equivalent efficacy and clinical toxicity was most frequent and severe. We felt that mitoxantrone could be consider a second-line drug in the treatment of advanced Hodgkin's disease.",Immunology

7501868,"Bioaccumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by marine organisms. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous in the marine environment, occurring at their highest environmental concentrations around urban centers. While they can occur naturally, the highest concentrations are mainly from human activities, and the primary sources are combustion products and petroleum. Two factors, lipid and organic carbon, control to a large extent the partitioning behavior of PAHs in sediment, water, and tissue; the more hydrophobic a compound, the greater the partitioning to these phases. These two factors, along with the octanol-water partition coefficient, are the best predictors of this partitioning and can be used to determine PAH behavior and its bioavailability in the environment. It is well known that the lipid of organisms contains the highest levels of hydrophobic compounds such as PAHs, and that organic carbon associated with sediment or dissolved in water can have the greatest influence on PAH bioavailability. Partitioning of combustion-derived PAHs between water and sediment may be much less than predicted, possibly because associations with particles are much stronger than expected. This reduced partitioning may produce erroneous results in predicting bioaccumulation where uptake from water is important. Accumulation of PAHs occurs in all marine organisms; however, there is a wide range in tissue concentrations from variable environmental concentrations, level and time of exposure, and species ability to metabolize these compounds. PAHs generally partition into lipid-rich tissues, and their metabolites can be found in most tissues. In fish, liver and bile accumulate the highest levels of parent PAH and metabolites; hence, these are the best tissues to analyze when determining PAH exposure. In invertebrates, the highest concentrations can be found in the internal organs, such as the hepatopancreas, and tissue concentrations appear to follow seasonal cycles, which may be related to variations in lipid content or spawning cycles. The major route of uptake for PAHs has been debated for years. For the more water-soluble PAHs, it is believed that the main route of uptake is through ventilated water and that the more hydrophobic compounds are taken in mainly through ingestion of food or sediment. There are many variables, such as chemical hydrophobicity, uptake efficiency, feeding rate, and ventilatory volume, which may affect the outcome. The route of uptake may be an important issue for short-term events; however, under long-term exposure and equilibrium conditions between water, prey, and sediment, the route of uptake may be immaterial because the same tissue burdens will be achieved regardless of uptake routes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Immunology
7501859,"A method for practical equalization mammography of the radiographically dense breast. It has been shown that equalization radiography can overcome the well-known problem of limited film latitude encountered in mammography of the radiographically dense breast. Current equalization geometries based on single scanning beam (SER) or multiple-beam techniques approach the heat-loading limits of mammographic x-ray sources and require excessively long scan times. The authors have proposed an alternative geometry for equalization mammography, rotary scanning equalization radiography (RSER), which uses a slot beam in a translate-rotate geometry. RSER provides the simplicity of a single-beam geometry while offering improved tube efficiency over multiple-beam geometries. Numerical simulations and a prototype imaging system are used to show that equalized mammograms exhibiting high contrast throughout the breast can be obtained with a large scanning beam translated over the image at only four scanning angles. These results indicate that RSER is an efficient, simple, and practical means of imaging the dense breast.",Immunology

The aim of our study was to compare the complication rate of convenional surgical and percutaneous dilational tracheostomies performed under general anaesthesia in critically ill patients. Fifty-three consecutive patients whose lungs were mechanically ventilated and who required tracheostomy were randomised to undergo either conventional surgical tracheostomy (n = 28) in the operating room or percutaneous dilational tracheostomy (n = 25) in the intensive care unit under general anaesthesia. All of the procedures were successfully completed. No deaths were related to the performance of either tracheostomy technique. Three patients in each group required a dressing change for minor bleeding at the tracheostomy site. There was no major bleeding requiring blood transfusion. One patient in each group developed atelectasis detected on chest x-ray post-operatively. In the surgical tracheostomy group, there were two patients with cuff leaks, one with a stomal infection and one with a pneumothorax. None of these complications occurred after percutaneous, dilational tracheostomy. We conclude that the low incidence of complications in both groups indicates that percutaneous dilational tracheostomy can be performed as safely in the intensive care unit with general anaesthesia as surgical tracheostomy can be performed in the operating room.",Immunology
7533107,"Interleukin-6-induced serine phosphorylation of transcription factor APRF: evidence for a role in interleukin-6 target gene induction. The cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) rapidly activates a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor, acute-phase response factor (APRF), by tyrosine phosphorylation. Activation and DNA binding of APRF are inhibited by inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases but not serine/threonine kinases. However, immediate-early gene induction by IL-6 and, as we show here, stimulation of the promoters of the genes for alpha 2-macroglobulin, Jun-B, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) are blocked by the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor H7. We now show that IL-6 triggers a delayed phosphorylation of APRF at serine resudues which can be reversed in vitro by protein phosphatase 2A and is also inhibited by H7. Therefore, APRF serine phosphorylation is likely to represent a crucial event in IL-6 signal transduction leading to target gene induction.",Immunology

To investigate the role of the cytochrome P-450 system in NO synthesis, cytochrome P-450IIIA, IIE and IA activities were specifically inhibited by cimetidine (IIIA), clotrimazole (IIIA), benzoflavone (IA) and disulfiram (IIE) in a model of cultured rat hepatocytes. Cytokine-induced NO synthesis was significantly decreased in the presence of cimetidine and clotrimazole. Kinetic analysis revealed a non-competitive mode of inhibition (Ki = 21 mM, cimetidine; Ki = 13 microM, clotrimazole). Reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunoblot analysis revealed no significant change in steady state levels of iNOS mRNA and protein expression with P-450IIIA inhibition. Purified iNOS enzyme activity was not altered. These data suggest that cytokine-mediated hepatocyte synthesis of NO is dependent upon P-450IIIA activity, which functions in a post-translational capacity.",Immunology
7531260,"In vivo thrombin and plasmin activities in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL): effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy. APL-associated hemostasis disorders result from at least two distinct mechanisms due to the release of procoagulant activities and plasminogen activators from the leukemic cells. These two mechanisms (thrombin activation and plasmin activation) may cleave the fibrinogen molecule, but their respective roles in low fibrinogen levels and bleeding diathesis genesis remain in dispute. In vivo ATRA therapy induces a rapid correction of both low fibrinogen level and bleeding tendency, but no clear explanation of this beneficial effect has been proposed. We prospectively investigated 27 APL patients at presentation for diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) markers (prothrombin activation fragment and thrombin/antithrombin complexes) and plasmin-dependent primary fibrinogenolysis markers (alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor consumption +/- plasmin/alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor complexes). Fourteen of these patients were then serially studied during the first 2 weeks of ATRA therapy. Four of them, however, developed an hyperleukocytosis requiring additional chemotherapy before the end of the 2nd week. At presentation, low level of fibrinogen was clearly associated with alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor deficiency (p < 0.01), while DIC was equally present in fibrinogenopenic and non-fibrinogenopenic patients. Moreover, was observed a rapid simultaneous correction of low fibrinogen levels and plasmin activation markers in APL patients undergoing ATRA therapy (before day 5), but a more prolonged persistence of DIC markers (until day 14). Initial bleeding syndrome seemed more frequent in patients with initial low fibrinogen level. These data indicate that plasmin-dependent primary fibrinogenolysis is the major etiologic factor of low fibrinogen level in APL patients. In vivo differentiation ATRA therapy induces a rapid decrease in the plasmin activation and a normalization of fibrinogen level, while DIC may in vivo persist for several weeks. Prospective studies evaluating antifibrinolytic agents as therapy of APL-associated hemostasis disorders should be considered. Additionally, prophylactic heparin therapy might be useful after day 5 in patients undergoing ATRA therapy, since they present a prolonged procoagulant tendency.",Immunology

7530964,"Callosal size in children with learning disabilities. The corpus callosum (CC), the main structure subserving hemispheric collaboration, that is necessary for efficient cognitive functioning, undergoes developmental processes such as axonal retraction and myelination. Callosal growth therefore is vulnerable for adverse events such as perinatal asphyxia, but there are also genetic and epigenetic factors that determine form and thickness. MRI scans of 110 children, either with specific learning disabilities (LD), i.e. dysphasia/dyslexia, or with several degrees of general LD, showed callosa that were highly variable in size. The callosal size corrected for brain size did not vary significantly according to the severity of the LD, although it tended to be smaller in severe LD, i.e. mental retardation. Callosal size varied however, due to the likely presence of genetic influences or of adverse perinatal events. Children with familial dysphasia/dyslexia, had a thicker CC, possibly reflecting a poorly understood neurodevelopmental mechanism that inhibits the establishment of cerebral dominance. LD children (all subgroups together) with perinatal adverse events had a smaller CC than the familial cases, suggesting CC damage. Despite a multitude of developmental factors influencing the final size, this study suggests that total callosal size, supposedly linked to interhemispheric function, may contribute to the pathophysiological mechanisms that give rise to LD.",Immunology

W1282X (W) and delta F508 (delta) are the two most common mutations of the cystic fibrosis Israeli population. Patients who are homozygotes (WW and delta delta) as well as compound heterozygotes (W delta) present a severe phenotype of the disease. In the present study, we have developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method for the detection of both mutations simultaneously in a single blastomere. Unfertilized human oocytes and single polyspermic blastomeres were subjected to a two-round PCR amplification: a first round of multiplex PCR followed by a second round of nested PCR, done separately at each locus. Clear signals at both loci were obtained in 51% (47/65) of oocytes and 69% (24/35) of blastomeres. The genotype of the single cell analysed was determined by endonuclease digestion of the W products and by heteroduplex formation of the delta F products. This diagnostic system will allow the identification of affected embryos (WW, delta delta, W delta) as well as phenotypically normal carriers (W+, +delta), and therefore may be used for cystic fibrosis preimplantation diagnosis in families who carry either or both mutations.",Immunology

We examined the effect on blood pressure of electrical or chemical stimulation of the rat brain ventral tegmental area (VTA) which is the region of origin of the A10 dopaminergic system. Electrical stimulation in urethane-anaesthetised rats (10-120 Hz, 80 microA) produced frequency-dependent increases in blood pressure (max 30-35 mmHg). These pressor responses could be significantly attenuated by pretreatment with the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol, but not the D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390. Chemical stimulation of the VTA, by microinjection of 10 nmol of the substance P analogue DiMe-C7, produced a sustained increase in blood pressure (max 10-15 mmHg), which could be completely prevented by pretreatment with haloperidol. These results suggest that stimulation of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA induces pressor responses and that projections from midbrain dopaminergic neurons, acting on dopamine D2 receptors, play a role in the regulation of blood pressure.",Immunology

7529912,"cAMP is not involved in interleukin-1-induced interleukin-6 release from human astrocytoma cells. We have previously shown that activation of the phosphatidyl-inositol/phospholipase C pathway could induce interleukin 6 (IL-6) release from U373MG human astrocytomes cells. We also found that, although interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) did not activate phosphatidy-linositol turnover, it induced, a robust release of IL-6. In the present study, we examined the role of adenylate cyclase/cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway in IL-6 release. Agents which mimicked (dibutyryl cAMP) or stimulated (isoproterenol and forskolin) cAMP formation were found to induce IL-6 release and their effects could be potentiated by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor.

Hypertrophy and increased gene expression of tachykinin neurons occur in the infundibular (arcuate) nucleus of postmenopausal women. We have hypothesized that the alterations in tachykinin gene expression in the hypothalami of postmenopausal women are secondary to ovarian failure and not due to age per se. In this study, in situ hybridization and computer-assisted microscopy were used to determine whether ovariectomy modulates neurokinin B (NKB), substance P (SP) or proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression in the rat arcuate nucleus. Four groups were examined: proestrus; diestrous day 1; ovariectomized, and constant estrus induced by a single injection of 20 mg/kg estradiol valerate. Rats were sacrificed 2 months after treatment. Computer-assisted microscopy was used to determine the number of tachykinin neurons, cell areas, and the autoradiographic grain density of labeled neurons. We report marked changes in NKB gene expression in ovariectomized rats. The number of neurons containing NKB gene transcripts was significantly greater in ovariectomized rats (16.9 +/- 1.0 neurons/arcuate section) than all other groups. There was also a significant difference in the number of NKB neurons/arcuate section between proestrous (8.9 +/- 1.8 neurons) and diestrous (4.8 +/- 1.0 neurons) rats.

7529790,"Expression of vitronectin receptor on human NK cells and its role in protein phosphorylation, cytokine production, and cell proliferation. In this paper, we provide evidence that the vitronectin receptor (VNR) alpha v beta 3 is expressed on human NK cells. The presence of this VNR on freshly purified NK cells was demonstrated by flow cytometry analysis, as well as biochemically, after 125I-labeled surface lactoperoxidase labeling and immunoprecipitation. mAbs LM142 and LM609 specific for alpha v and alpha v beta 3, respectively, precipitated a heterodimer of alpha- and beta-chains with approximate molecular masses of 155 and 110 kDa under nonreducing conditions. Under reducing conditions, there was an apparent decrease in the molecular mass of the alpha-chain, which is likely to result from the release of a protein of 20 to 30 kDa linked by internal disulfide bond to the alpha v-chain. Integrin alpha v beta 3 expressed on NK cells became functional, i.e., was able to bind its ligand, vitronectin (VN), only after cellular activation or when costimulation with an additional signal was provided. Thus, NK cells adhered to plastic-immobilized VN only after IL-2 activation, and RGD-containing synthetic peptides or mAbs specific for alpha v beta 3 complex inhibited this binding. To assess the role of the VNR in signal transduction, anti-beta 3 mAb was used to cluster the VNR on NK cells and, thereby, mimic the process that occurs during formation of adhesive contacts. Cross-linking of VNR on fresh NK cells stimulated phosphorylation on tyrosine residues of several intracellular proteins. The major increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in proteins of approximate molecular masses of 75 and 120 kDa. Therefore, signal transduction by the VNR on NK cells induced activation of intracellular protein kinases. Ligand engagement of the VNR on NK cells also costimulated cytokine production and proliferation of NK cells. Binding of NK cells to plastic-immobilized VN served as a costimulus with either anti-Fc gamma RIII or IL-2 to produce IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and cell proliferation. Our findings suggest that occupancy and subsequent clustering of VNRs play a role in the activation and function of human NK cells.",Immunology
7529586,"Interaction of apical and basal membrane ion channels underlies electroreception in ampullary epithelia of skates. The exquisite sensitivity of elasmobranch fishes to electric fields is thought to reside in electroreceptive organs called ampullae of Lorenzini. We measured the stimulus-response behavior of ampullary organs excised from skates. Under open-circuit conditions, the ampullary organ showed three distinct response states: spontaneous repetitive spikes, evoked spikes, and small, damped oscillatory responses. Under short-circuit conditions, the amplitude range for a linear current response to a sinusoidal (0.5 Hz) voltage clamp of an organ (assessed by spectral analysis of the harmonics generated) was 7-200 microV rms. Changes in the spike firing rate of the afferent nerve innervating the organ were evident for voltage clamps of the ampullary epithelium of 3 microV and the spike rate saturated for clamp steps exceeding 100 microV. Thus, the linear response range of the ampullary epithelium exceeded the range in spike firing rate of the afferent nerve. The steady-state transorgan electrical properties under voltage clamp conditions were obtained by analysis of complex admittance determinations in the frequency range 0.05-20 Hz for perturbations (< 100 microV rms) in the linear range. Admittance functions were distinctly related to the preparation states observed under open-circuit conditions. A negative real part in the organ admittance (i.e., a steady-state negative conductance generated by the preparation) was a common characteristic of the two (open-circuit) excitable states. The negative conductance was also confirmed by the direction of current flow through the ampullary epithelium in response to step voltage clamps. We conclude that the steady state-negative conductance is an essential property of the ampullary epithelium,and we suggest that the interplay of negative and positive conductances generated by ion channels in apical and basal membranes of receptor cells results in signal amplification that may contribute significantly to the electric field sensitivity of ampullary organs.",Immunology

(beta 1 integrinbright expression has been shown to be a characteristic feature of keratinocyte stem cells in culture (Jones, P. H., and F. M. Watt. 1993. Cell. 73:713-724). Using the above assay, we determined whether lesional T lymphocytes in psoriasis could be directly responsible for the induction of the stem cell hyperproliferation that is characteristic of this disease. Indeed, CD4+ T lymphocytes, cloned from lesional psoriatic skin and stimulated by immobilized anti-CD3 plus fibronectin, promoted psoriatic uninvolved keratinocyte stem cell proliferation via soluble factors. This induction appeared to be through accelerated recruitment of stem cells from their quiescent state (G0) into cell cycle. By contrast, normal keratinocyte stem cells exhibited no such growth stimulation. Supernatants exhibiting growth induction all contained high levels of GM-CSF and gamma-IFN, low IL-3 and TNF-alpha, and variable IL-4. Only anti-gamma-IFN antibody was able to neutralize growth stimulatory activity of the supernatants on psoriatic uninvolved keratinocyte stem cells. However, because recombinant gamma-IFN alone inhibited growth in this assay, these data suggest that, in psoriasis, gamma-IFN acts cooperatively with other growth factors in the immune induction of cell cycle progression by the normally quiescent stem cell keratinocytes.",Immunology

We found purification by silica particles to be at least as sensitive and in certain circumstances more sensitive than that by traditional phenol-chloroform extraction. This improved sensitivity may be due to more efficient recovery of HCV RNA by silica particles. HCV RNA appears to bind to silica particles in a saturable fashion, and the addition of extraneous nucleic acids (salmon sperm DNA or tRNA) decreases the binding in a dose-related fashion.

All three areas showed local dorsal-ventral projections into each of the other areas, and a contralateral projection to the homologous area on the other side of the brain. All three also revealed a trajectory through the striatum, resulting in heavy innervation of the caudate nucleus, the claustrum, and a lighter projection to the agranular insular cortex. The thalamic projections of areas 24 and 32 were similar, but not identical, with projections to the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and all of the midline nuclei. However, the primary thalamic projections from area 25 were to the intralaminar and midline nuclei. All three areas also projected to the ventromedial and to a lesser extent to the ventral posterior thalamic nuclei. Projections were also observed in the lateral hypothalamus, in an area just lateral to the descending limb of the fornix. Amygdala projections from areas 32 and 24 were primarily to the lateral, basolateral and basomedial nuclei, but area 25 also projected to the central nucleus. All three areas also showed projections to the midbrain periaqueductal central gray, median raphe nucleus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, locus coeruleus and pontine nuclei. However, only areas 24 and the more dorsal portions of area 32 projected to the superior colliculus. Area 25 and the ventral portions of area 32 also showed a bilateral projection to the parabrachial nuclei and dorsal and ventral medulla. The dorsal portions of area 32, and all of area 24 were, however, devoid of these projections. It is suggested that these differential projections are responsible for the diverse roles that the cytoarchitectonic subfields of the mPFC have been demonstrated to play in associative learning.",Immunology

The number of CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood of cancer patients is known to be increased following the administration of high dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic growth factors. These so-called peripheral blood stem cell grafts are now frequently used for autologous transplantation of patients with malignancies. In this report, we address the question of whether true long-term repopulating pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (PHSC) are mobilized into peripheral blood following chemotherapy plus granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization. We have examined the presence of stem cells in mobilized peripheral blood (MPB) by using an antibody to the human Thy-1 molecule to stain the CD34+Lineage- (Lin-) population. The kinetics of mobilization of CD34+Thy-1+ Lin- cells into peripheral blood were studied, and the percentage of cells with this phenotype was found to vary widely depending on the day of leukapheresis. A CD34+Thy-1+Lin- cell population, potentially containing PHSCs, was isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and analyzed for activity. The multilineage differentiative capacity of this candidate stem cell-containing population in MPB was determined using an in vitro long-term culture system, in which cobblestone area formation was used as a means of detecting PHSCs. We also measured repopulating capacity by using two in vivo models in which severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-hu mice were implanted with human fetal bone or thymus grafts. Using these assays, we show that the highest frequency of cobblestone area-forming cells (CAFC) after 7 weeks of culture was observed in a subpopulation of CD34+Lin- cells, which expressed low levels of Thy-1. This cell population was capable of producing both B and myeloid cells, and maintaining CD34+Lin- cells in these long term cultures. Moreover, the CD34+Thy-1+Lin- cell subset possessed a higher ability to engraft and to demonstrate multilineage differentiative potential at 8 weeks in the SCID-hu bone assay. However, in the SCID-hu thymus model, both Thy-1+ and Thy-1- subpopulations were capable of donor T-cell engraftment at 6 weeks, suggesting the presence of cells capable of initiating T lymphopoiesis in both populations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Immunology

7528945,"Genetic predisposition of autoimmune disease and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Autoimmune disease is a polygenic disease in which various genetic factors play crucial roles. The familial clustering and the association of HLA haplotypes have been well-recognized. There is a close association between chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and autoimmune disease. Like autoimmune diseases, CLL is the type of leukemia most often occurring among close relatives. The patients with CLL frequently share common HLA haplotypes with relatives with autoimmune disease. As the majority of CLL is of CD5+ B-cell type, and as CD5+ B cells are suggested to be involved in autoimmunity, certain regulatory abnormalities in the proliferation and differentiation of CD5 B cells may be involved in both B-CLL and autoimmune disease. I discuss here the possibility that different, but related, MHC haplotypes would predispose either to autoimmune disease or to B-CLL, based on our findings obtained from MHC (H-2)-congenic New Zealand mouse strains.",Immunology

Between 1984 and 1992 authors performed 307 surgical interventions for patients with rectal cancer, of these 199 operations were curative (65%). Local excision of the tumour was carried out in 9 cases: 2 with palliative intent, 7 were considered a curative treatment, that constituted 3.5% of all curative procedures. Five tumours were removed by transanal local excision, 2 located in the upper part of the rectum required laparotomy and rectotomy. No operative mortality. One wound sepsis was registered after laparotomy. There was one local recurrence after removing the primary tumour. At the same time 83 patients suffering abdominoperineal resection or anterior resection had tumour limited to the rectal wall without lymph node metastasis. The mortality was 1.4%, the morbidity 28% and local recurrence rate was 19% in this group. The difference between the the results of the two groups did not achieve statistical significance included the survival too. Of the 83 tumours removed by more radical operations 38 located between 1-8 cm from the anal verge. Excluding tumours poorly differentiated and those with diameter larger than 3 cm, 17 rectal cancer would have been suitable for transanal local excision, that constitutes 8.5% of the curative operations. with more accurate preoperative staging the transanal local excision for carcinoma of the rectum can be performed more frequently than earlier. The risk of the operation is lower than those of the abdominoperineal or anterior resection and the late results are comparable if strict selection criteria are implemented.",Immunology
7528878,"Application of a multiple fixation regimen to study the adaptive response to ionizing radiation in lymphocytes of two human donors. The majority of experiments studying the adaptive response using chromosomal aberrations have been performed with proliferating lymphocytes. It is known that lymphocytes have variable cell cycle transit times and it has been pointed out that in such cases aberration scores obtained from a single harvest are not very meaningful because cells harvested together in metaphase at any one time after irradiation were in different parts of the cell cycle at the time of irradiation. The scored sample will thus always contain a mixture of cells having different radiosensitivities and any variations of cell proliferation will influence the aberration score. In order to get a more representative aberration score a multiple fixation regimen was applied to lymphocytes of two human donors. Cells receiving the adapting + challenging and the challenging dose were fixed at three intervals after the challenge. In lymphocytes of donor 1 no adaptive response was seen at any fixation time in two experiments. In lymphocytes of donor 2, however, a reduction of aberration frequencies was seen, but at different fixation times in the two experiments. In a third experiment, no adaptive response was detected. It is concluded that the response observed at some fixation times in lymphocytes of donor 2 is rather a result of some phenomenon associated with variations of cell cycle kinetics than of induced radiation resistance.",Immunology

In the last decade, a great deal of attention has been focused on functional endoscopic nasal surgery for chronic sinus disease. There has been less emphasis in regard to the obvious advantages of the endoscope for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of tumours of the nose and paranasal sinuses. This presentation discusses in detail the reasons that the endoscopic technique is useful when applied to diagnosis of benign or malignant lesions in these areas. This new technique can be used to remove benign tumours, avoiding the external excisions that often can be disfiguring to the patient. The endoscope is less useful for removal of malignant lesions unless they are very small and localized, but it can be used as a palliative measure. Early diagnosis of recurrence, especially for benign tumours, is possible, and further localized excision can result in the cure.",Immunology

Adenocarcinomas of uncertain origin are a frequent problem for surgical pathologists. To determine the utility of immunostaining for cytokeratin 7 and cytokeratin 20 in the separation of pulmonary adenocarcinomas from colonic adenocarcinomas, we studied routinely processed, formalin-fixed tissue from 151 of these tumors using commercially available monoclonal antibodies and an avidin-biotin immunohistochemical technique. Used alone, neither cytokeratin 7 immunostaining or cytokeratin 20 immunostaining reliably separated these tumors. However, the immunophenotype of cytokeratin 7 positive/cytokeratin 20 negative was seen in 86% of the pulmonary adenocarcinomas, and in 0% of the colonic adenocarcinomas. Conversely, the cytokeratin 7-negative/cytokeratin 20-positive immunophenotype was seen in 77% of the colonic carcinomas, and in 0% of the pulmonary tumors. In conclusion, cytokeratin 7/cytokeratin 20 immunostaining patterns may be helpful in separating pulmonary adenocarcinomas from colonic adenocarcinomas.",Immunology

In the present study, we investigated the possible role of nitric oxide synthase in lung injury using female Fischer 344 rats as a model animal and O,O,S-trimethyl phosphorothioate as an example of lung toxicants. One form of nitric oxide synthase, Ca2+/calmodulin dependent type, decreased monotonously in a dose-dependent manner in the cerebellum. In contrast, O,O,S-trimethyl phosphorothioate increased activities of Ca2+ independent nitric oxide synthase in the lung in a dose-associated manner from 5 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg, but decreased at 30 mg/kg. Lung toxicity of O,O,S-trimethyl phosphorothioate, however, as judged both by functional impairments (PaCO2 and [HCO3-]) and histopathological changes, increased sharply at 30 mg/kg. We thus tested the hypothesis that a potent nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester, may modify lung injury induced by O,O,S-trimethyl phosphorothioate. Treatment with NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester at 20 mg/kg/day aggravated lung injury induced by O,O,S-trimethyl phosphorothioate: Pulmonary oedema and bleeding occurred, leading to an increase in mortalities at 15 mg/kg of O,O,S-trimethyl phosphorothioate, at which level it did not induce such changes as when dosed alone. These findings indicate that nitric oxide synthase in the lung might play a protective role in lung injury.",Immunology

7527558,"Amino-terminal basic residues of Src mediate membrane binding through electrostatic interaction with acidic phospholipids. Membrane targeting of pp60src (Src) is mediated by its myristoylated amino terminus. We demonstrate that, in addition to myristate, six basic residues in the amino terminus are essential for high-affinity binding to the lipid bilayer via electrostatic interaction with acidic phospholipids. Specifically, c-Src was shown to bind 2500-fold more strongly to vesicles composed of the physiological ratio of 2:1 phosphatidylcholine (PC)/phosphatidylserine (PS) than to neutral PC bilayer vesicles. The apparent Kd for binding of c-Src to the PC/PS bilayer was 6 x 10(-7) M. This interaction is sufficiently strong to account for c-Src membrane targeting. Mutants of c-Src in which the amino-terminal basic residues were replaced by neutral asparagine residues exhibited binding isotherms approaching that of wild-type binding to neutral bilayers (apparent Kd of 2 x 10(-3) M). The transforming v-Src and activated c-Src (Y527F) proteins also bound more strongly to PC/PS bilayers (apparent Kd of approximately 1 x 10(-5) M) than to neutral PC bilayers. In vivo experiments with Src mutants confirmed the role of positive charge in mediating membrane binding and cellular transformation.",Immunology

The occurrence of two N-terminally extended forms of galanin in the porcine adrenal medulla was reported earlier by Bersani et al. (1991). We have synthesized and examined the ability of these two extended forms of galanin, galanin-(-7-29) and galanin-(-9-29), to bind to galanin receptors in the rat dorsal spinal cord. The effect of intrathecal (i.t.) injection of these peptides on spinal flexor reflex excitability in decerebrate, spinalized, unanesthetized rats was also studied. Both galanin-(-7-29) and galanin-(-9-29) fully displaced specific 125I-monoido-[Tyr26]porcine galanin (125I-galanin) binding to membranes prepared from rat dorsal spinal cord, with IC50 values 0.13 and 0.14 microM, respectively. The metabolic half-lives in spinal cord membranes for galanin-(1-29), galanin-(-7-29) and galanin-(-9-29) were 117 +/- 17, 271 +/- 23 and 185 +/- 19 min, respectively. I.t. injection of galanin-(-7-29) and galanin-(-9-29) mimicked the biphasic facilitatory and inhibitory effect of i.t. galanin-(1-29) on flexor reflex excitability and antagonized C-fiber conditioning stimulus-induced spinal cord hyperexcitability, but with reduced potencies compared to galanin-(1-29). We suggest that the N-terminally extended forms of galanin act as endogenous ligands with low agonist activity.",Immunology

Such samples were analyzed in the 5' untranslated region and in the nonstructural 5 (NS5) region. Classification based on phylogenetic analysis of the commonly used 222-bp-long NS5B region was possible for most but not all of the selected sera. Therefore, the core/envelope 1 region (579 bp) and a larger NS5B (340 bp) region were also analyzed. Only the phylogenetic analysis of the 340-bp NS5B region of these newly identified and published isolates provided unambiguous classification into types and subtypes. Furthermore, unequivocal evidence for four subtypes in type 2 and eight subtypes in type 4 was provided. A specific recognition sequence in the 5' untranslated region was observed for every newly identified subtype. Based on 1830 pair-wise comparisons in NS5B, isolates belonging to the same subtype showed evolutionary distances of < 0.127 and isolates of the same type exhibited evolutionary distances of < 0.328. These phylogenetic border distances can be conveniently used for classification of hepatitis C virus isolates into types and subtypes.",Immunology
7522802,"Acidification of extracellular environment inhibits CCK-8-induced Ca2+ entry into pancreatic acinar cells of rat evaluated by a Mn(2+)-quenching method. The fluorescence of fura 2, a Ca(2+)-sensitive dye, is quenched in the presence of other divalent cations such as Mn2+. This characteristic of the dye provides a useful measure for investigating the role of Ca2+ in cellular functions. The present experiments were thus designed to examine the effects of extracellular pH (pHo) on cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8)-induced Ca2+ entry into isolated perifused pancreatic acini of the rat using a Mn(2+)-quenching method. At a standard pHo (7.4), addition of Mn2+ (1 mM) during continuous stimulation with 100 pM CCK-8 quenched fura 2 fluorescence excited by both excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm. Lowering pHo to 6.0 weakened the quenching, whereas elevating pHo to 8.0 during the stimulation accelerated the quenching compared with that at standard pHo. Accordingly, when acinar cells were stimulated continuously with 100 pM CCK-8 at pHo 6.0, the second sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was decreased compared with that at pHo 7.4, but the [Ca2+]i increase reappeared when the pHo was neutralized from 6.0 to 7.4 even after cessation of the stimulation. The second sustained increase of [Ca2+]i was achieved at pHo 8.0, but it declined rapidly when CCK-8 stimulation was terminated and pHo was simultaneously restored to 7.4. Amylase release induced by continuous stimulation with 100 pM CCK-8 showed a biphasic time course. A second sustained phase of amylase release was significantly reduced at pHo 6.0, but amylase release increased again when pHo was restored to 7.4. These results indicate that extracellular pH modifies the extent of secretagogue-induced Ca2+ entry into the pancreatic acinar cell, and the inhibitory effects of lowered pHo on the secretory response are largely due to a limited increase in [Ca2+]i.",Immunology

The major value of intermediate filaments (IFs) in biological and applied research lies in their high order of cell and tissue specificity. This is particularly well illustrated in keratin (K) expression in various oral epithelia. Although the original class of IF is usually conserved in tissues after neoplastic transformation, epithelia show a tendency to shift their pattern of keratin expression in a manner which, while not predictable with precision, may sometimes be of diagnostic or prognostic significance. This review compares the keratins in normal oral epithelia, which show a mainly site-dependent expression, with those in squamous cell carcinoma. Key changes in the latter are the presence of simple epithelial keratins, K8 and K18 (occasional K7), reduced expression of differentiation-linked keratins (K1, K10, K4 and K13) and a tendency for down-regulation of primary keratins, K5 and K14. Moderate and severe dysplasias also tend to exhibit K8 and K18 with concomitant disordered expression of differentiation-linked keratins. There are reports of similar changes after neoplastic transformation in other mucosal sites and skin. Before this information can be applied diagnostically in immunocytochemical studies, the anti-keratin antibodies must be fully characterised and their interaction with the relevant tissue, both frozen and conventionally processed, should be evaluated.",Immunology

Viral DNA sequences were determined over the V3 region of env from 28 infected individuals living in the high HIV-1 prevalence Brazilian cities of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Twenty-six belonged to envelope sequence subtype B, prevalent in North America and Europe, and one was classified as subtype F, found recently in Brazil and in Romania (one appeared to be a B/F recombinant). Octameric sequences at the tip of the subtype B V3 loops were variable and distinct from those prevalent in North America and Europe. The GPGR motif, prevalent in North American/European strains, was found in only 8 (28.5%) sequences, whereas GWGR was found in 12 (43%) and novel sequences in 8 (28.5%). Brazilian subtype B sequences also diverged from the consensus North American/European strains over the remainder of the V3 loop. These results suggest that Brazilian HIV-1 B strains may have important antigenic differences from prototype subtype B strains currently being evaluated for use in HIV vaccines. These results should be taken into account for future vaccine programs in Brazil.",Immunology

The likelihood of a positive acid-fast sputum smear, related to chest radiograph findings, CD4 cell counts, drug sensitivity, and the presence of disseminated disease. Overall, 60 percent of patients with HIV had positive acid-fast smears, compared with 57 percent of non-HIV-infected patients. A relative absence of cavitary infiltrates did not substantially reduce the frequency of acid-fast smears in patients with and without HIV. Patients with HIV and CD4 count < 50, 50 to 200, and > 200 had positive acid-fast smear rates of 58 percent, 60 percent, and 56 percent, respectively; HIV-infected patients with drug-resistant organisms had 65 percent positive smears. Smear positivity was 96 percent in patients with HIV infection and disseminated MTB, CONCLUSIONS: Positive acid-fast sputum smears in culture-proven MTB occur with similar frequency in patients with and without HIV. The absence of cavitary disease did not significantly reduce the frequency of positive acid-fast smears. For patients with HIV, the likelihood of a positive smear was also independent of CD4 cell counts and drug resistance.

Liver sinusoidal cells play an important role in host defense by clearing particulate matter and macromolecules from the circulation. In this study, receptor-mediated endocytosis in sinusoidal cells was examined in two-thirds hepatectomized rats using 125I-labeled formaldehyde-treated bovine serum albumin (fBSA) as an endocytable macromolecule. The liver-weight to body-weight ratio in hepatectomized rats returned to the control value 10 days after hepatectomy. The endocytotic index for fBSA in sinusoidal cells decreased significantly to 0.0210 +/- 0.0017 (controls, 0.0598 +/- 0.0019) on the first day, then returned to the control level at 5 days (0.0554 +/- 0.0030). The changes in hepatic uptake for fBSA showed a similar time course of the endocytotic index. A transient increase in the uptake of fBSA per unit weight of liver of 22-39% above control occurred 2 to 3 days after hepatectomy. In contrast to fBSA, the endocytotic index in hepatocytes evaluated with 125I-labeled asialofetuin reached the minimum level on the second day, and then recovered to the control level 10 days after hepatectomy. These results suggest that endocytosis of fBSA by sinusoidal cells decreases after hepatectomy and rapidly recovers to normal before the completion of liver regeneration, whereas endocytosis of asialofetuin by hepatocytes decreases following hepatic resection and returns to normal when regeneration is substantially complete.",Immunology

In this communication, we have characterized the resistance to AZUrd in tumorigenic mouse C3H-OS osteosarcoma cells and non-tumorigenic MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cells. DNA and RNA blot analysis showed a 30-fold increase in UMP synthase specific DNA and a 10-fold increase in mRNA, respectively, in resistant versus non-resistant C3H-OS cells. No corresponding increases in either UMP synthetase DNA or mRNA were evident in resistant MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. Karyotype analysis of MC3T3-E1 and C3H-OS cells revealed translocations in the resistant cells. Regardless of drug-sensitive or resistant phenotype, the normal and neoplastic cells exhibited aneuploidy which was significantly more pronounced in the non-resistant tumor cells. Additionally, the number of chromosomes decreased in all resistant cells whether normal or neoplastic. We conclude that genomic instability in neoplastic cells is a prerequisite for the generation of drug resistant variants via the process of gene amplification.",Immunology
7520893,"[Are tip links the basis for mechanosensitivity of hair cells?]. The singular sensitivity of cochlear outer hair cells suggests an extremely efficient exploitation of the energy supplied by the mechanical stimulus. If, however, the transduction channels were located at one end of the hair bundle's tip links, not more than 1/250 of the stimulus energy could be used to change the open probability of the channels. Furthermore, the mechanosensitive nematocytes of Hydra vulgaris possess a sensory hair bundle with horizontal links and have a transduction mechanism with functional properties similar to those of hair cells, even though tip links are absent between stereocilia. Therefore, I propose that the transduction channels of hair cells are connected to the short row-to-row horizontal links at the distal ends of neighboring stereocilia. These links, as well as the tip links, are oriented in accordance with the directionality of hair cell mechanosensitivity. The elastic elements connected with the horizontal links receive a larger part of the stimulus energy than the tip links. Since the short horizontal links resemble rigid rods rather than ""spare springs"", the points of insertion of these links in the stereocilia (i.e., the transduction channels) must move a distance upsilon parallel to the longitudinal axis of the stereocilium when the hair bundle is deflected by an angle phi. Computation shows that upsilon is proportional to phi. In the stereocilium, elastic elements (""gating springs"") connect the cytoskeleton and transduction channel. The force in the gating springs that is counteracting the movement of the transduction channels may be varied in the process of adaptation by an active motor, as has been proposed in other investigations.",Immunology

7519246,"Arterial smooth muscle cells express nitric oxide synthase in response to endothelial injury. Endothelial cells regulate vascular tone by secreting paracrine mediators that control the contractility of arterial smooth muscle cells. Nitric oxide (NO) is an important vasodilating agent that is generated from L-arginine by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which is expressed constitutively by the endothelium. NO also inhibits platelet aggregation, contributing to the antithrombotic properties of the endothelial surface. It would therefore be expected that loss of the endothelium during arterial injury would lead to vasospasm and thrombosis but instead, the neointima formed after injury has a nonthrombogenic surface and a maintained vascular patency. We report here that arterial smooth muscle cells in the neointima formed after a deendothelializing balloon injury to the rat carotid artery express the cytokine-inducible isoform of NOS. Expression was detectable by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from day 1-14 after injury and in situ hybridization showed expression of NOS mRNA by neointimal smooth muscle cells, particularly at the surface of the lesion. This was associated with systemically detectable NO production as revealed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis of nitrosylated red cell hemoglobin. Local NO production by intimal smooth muscle cells after endothelial injury could represent an important mechanism for the maintenance of arterial patency and nonthrombogenicity in the injured artery.",Immunology

Non-glial intermediate filament (IMF) proteins, as well as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin, were studied by immunohistochemistry in 24 gliomas including low grade astrocytoma, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma, oligodendroglioma, ependymoma and ependymoblastoma, which were fixed in ethanol and embedded in paraffin. Cytoskeletal elements isolated from two glioblastomas were examined with immunoblot analysis. All tumors had GFAP-positive neoplastic cells and vimentin was also found in all the tumors except one oligodendroglioma. Twenty-three gliomas were immunostained with anti-desmin polyclonal antibody (DM-P), but anti-desmin monoclonal antibody reacted to only one glioblastoma. DM-P might crossreact with GFAP and vimentin. Cytokeratin expression was investigated with six antibodies. Twenty gliomas (83%) were positive for the antibody against epidermal keratin (CK-SE), however positive immunoreactivity varied from 58 to 8% with other cytokeratin antibodies. With the Western blot method, CK-SE had protein bands at 53 and 60-66 kDa. Neurofilament was expressed in one pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, one anaplastic astrocytoma, one glioblastoma and one ependymoblastoma. Expression of nonglial IMF proteins were observed in 21 tumors (88%), and coexpression of 4 or 5 classes of IMF proteins in 3 tumors (13%). We conclude that, in addition to GFAP and vimentin, gliomas express several types of non-glial IMF proteins.",Immunology

7517990,"Changes in subcellular localization and surface expression of L-selectin, alkaline phosphatase, and Mac-1 in human neutrophils during stimulation with inflammatory mediators. The localization of the adhesion protein L-selectin in human neutrophils was determined by subcellular fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy and compared with the localization of Mac-1 (alpha m beta 2) and alkaline phosphatase, the marker for secretory vesicles. L-selectin was found to be localized exclusively on the plasma membrane of unstimulated cells and also of stimulated cells, although markedly diminished. This was in contrast to Mac-1, which was also localized in secretory vesicles and in specific/gelatinase granules as shown previously [Sengeløv, H., et al. J. Clin. Invest. (1993) 92, 1467-1476]. Stimulation of neutrophils with inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), platelet-activating factor (PAF), or f-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), induced parallel up-regulation of the surface membrane content of alkaline phosphatase and Mac-1 and down-regulation of L-selectin, as evidenced by flow cytometry. Preimbedding immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that L-selectin was present mainly on tips of microvilli in unstimulated cells and showed that alkaline phosphatase and Mac-1 were randomly distributed on the surface membrane of fMLP-stimulated cells. These studies indicate that the transition of neutrophils from L-selectin-presenting cells to Mac-1-presenting cells induced by inflammatory mediators is mediated by incorporation of secretory vesicle membrane, rich in Mac-1 and devoid of L-selectin, into the plasma membrane.",Immunology
7517982,"Expression of B7 costimulatory molecule in cultured human epidermal Langerhans cells is regulated at the mRNA level. Langerhans cells (LC) belong to the dendritic cell lineage and are the principal antigen-presenting cells of squamous epithelia. Short-term cultured LC (cLC) exhibit a marked augmented capacity to stimulate allogeneic T cells and acquire the ability to activate naive T cells, probably in relation to enhanced expression of accessory signals. In this study, we evaluated the expression of B7 costimulatory molecule (CD80) in human freshly isolated (fLC) and cLC at both the protein and mRNA level. Staining of frozen skin sections did not reveal any epidermal dendritic cell reactive with either of two different anti-B7 monoclonal antibodies. fLC in suspension did not exhibit any B7 staining as evaluated by two-color flow-cytometry analysis and immunoelectron microscopy. In contrast, LC that were cultured for 24-72 h displayed strong surface B7 reactivity with a characteristic patchy pattern. Treatment with dispase and trypsin did not reduce B7 staining of cLC. Following warming to 37 degrees C, cLC tagged with anti-B7 monoclonal antibody and gold-conjugated secondary antibody could internalize surface B7 by using the organelles of receptor-mediated endocytosis. B7 mRNA, detected by the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction technique, was expressed at a low level in purified (> 90% HLA-DR+) fLC but not in LC-depleted epidermal cells, and was markedly upregulated in purified cLC. The results indicate that 1) fLC do not express B7 protein on their surface, but acquire B7 during culture, 2) surface B7 is not sensitive to trypsin, 3) B7 expression is regulated primarily at the mRNA level, and 4) membrane B7 can be internalized within cLC. B7 molecule on CLC may be relevant to their increased antigen-presenting cell potency and ability to stimulate naive T lymphocytes.",Immunology
7516337,"The T-cell antigen receptor utilizes Lck, Raf-1, and MEK-1 for activating mitogen-activated protein kinase. Evidence for the existence of a second protein kinase C-dependent pathway in an Lck-negative Jurkat cell mutant. T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) ligation of an Lck-deficient Jurkat mutant, J.CaM1, with anti-CD3 or anti-TCR beta monoclonal antibodies failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of p42MAPK. The same stimuli activated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in J.CaM1 cells transfected with Lck, demonstrating that Lck plays a critical role in MAP kinase activation. Utilizing immunocomplex kinase assays, we demonstrated that TCR/CD3 ligation activated a MAP kinase kinase kinase (Raf-1) as well as a MAP kinase kinase (MEK-1) in Jurkat but not in J.CaM1 cells. It was possible, however, to activate Raf-1, MEK-1, and p42MAPK in J.CaM1 cells during treatment with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which activates protein kinase C (PKC). This demonstrates the presence of a PKC-dependent pathway which functions independently from Lck in MAP kinase activation. Stimulation of Jurkat cells with either anti-TCR beta or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody failed to induce substantial tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc proteins or their association with Grb2 which forms a complex with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor hSOS. However, the same stimuli induced tyrosine phosphorylation of another putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor, p95Vav, in Jurkat but not J.CaM1 cells. Moreover, Lck was reversibly co-immunoprecipitated with p95Vav, and the stoichiometry of binding increased in anti-CD3-treated Jurkat cells. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of p95Vav. These data show that the TCR activates MAP kinase by way of a signaling cascade, which depends upon Lck, and may be mediated by downstream events involving PKC or p95Vav which act on Raf-1 and MEK-1.",Immunology

The presence of antibodies reactive to a recently cloned host-derived antigen GOR is highly correlated with the presence of antibodies to the hepatitis C virus (HCV). We explored the molecular basis for this observation, and address the following question: are antibodies reactive with GOR19-27 (QKAKSNPNR) a result of a cross-reactivity triggered by the antigenic region at residues 9-17 of HCV core (RKTKRNTNR)? We compared the relative antibody avidity between antibodies reactive to both regions, and determined the residues essential for antibody binding using substitution peptide analogues. Of 96 sera assayed, 60 were found positive for anti-HCV, and of these 55 were found to react with HCV core. Twenty-nine sera were found reactive to the GOR peptide, and these were all reactive to HCV core. In most cases the relative antibody avidity of antibodies reactive to GOR was higher for the HCV core peptide. In 21 of the GOR-reactive sera we were able to determine the essential residues for antibody binding. The essential residues in > 50% of all tested sera coincided with the well conserved residues Lys10, Lys12, Asn14, and Asn16. Also, reactivity to GOR was not related to any certain serotype of antibodies to HCV. Taken together, these findings explain at the molecular level the observed cross-reactivity between these two proteins, since sequence homology per se is not evidence for cross-reactivity.",Immunology

7516083,"Expression of the costimulatory molecule B7/BB1 in autoimmune thyroid disease. Efficient antigen presentation requires the provision of a costimulatory signal, the best characterized of which is B7/BB1. It is unclear whether thyroid cells expressing class II molecules can present autoantigens to T cells, although this has been suggested as an important mechanism in the initiation of Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. We have found that thyroid cells from patients with thyroid autoimmunity do not express B7/BB1 in vivo or in vitro, even after activation with the cytokines interleukin-1 or gamma-interferon, or with a phorbol ester. Increased numbers of CD20+ B cells and CD14+ dendritic cells expressing B7/BB1 were found in intrathyroidal lymphocyte preparations from such patients compared to peripheral blood. These results suggest that conventional antigen-presenting cells rather than thyroid cells provide B7/BB1 costimulatory activity in autoimmune thyroid disease, and argue against a role for the thyroid cells themselves in autoantigen presentation to T cells via the B7/BB1 pathway.",Immunology

Guinea-pig main bronchi were stimulated transmurally in vitro by electrical field stimulation in the presence of indomethacin 10(-6) M, propranolol 10(-6) M and phosphoramidon 10(-5) M. Two contractile neurogenic responses were successively observed. The second noncholinergic contraction was concentration dependently inhibited or abolished by neurotensin whereas the first cholinergic contraction was only partially inhibited. SR 48692, a novel antagonist of neurotensin receptors, reduced the inhibition induced by neurotensin (pKB = 9.75) whereas levocabastine, an antagonist of low-affinity neurotensin receptors, did not significantly modify the inhibitory effects of neurotensin on both neurally-mediated contractions. These results demonstrate that neurotensin exerts an inhibitory effect on neurotransmission in guinea-pig airways. Furthermore, the present study shows that the newly developed neurotensin receptors antagonist, SR 48692, is a potent inhibitor of the neurotensin inhibitory effects on cholinergic and noncholinergic contractions induced by electrical field stimulation of the guinea-pig isolated main bronchus.",Immunology

Purkinje cells were examined in three familial cases of olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) by means of the Golgi method, and neurofilament and calcium-binding protein immunocytochemistry. Reduced dendritic arborizations, as seen with different techniques, early formation of axonal spheroids, and abnormal accumulation of phosphorylated neurofilament epitopes in dendrites, somata and axonal spheroids, together with limited formation of proximal spine-like protrusions were the main changes in Purkinje cells. These lesions are unlikely to be the consequence of anterograde degeneration secondary to olivary atrophy, as postulated by some investigators, but probably represent primary damage to Purkinje cells in patients with OPCA. Reduced dendritic arborizations result in a decrease of receptor sites for parallel fibres and deprive granule cells of their main targets. Abnormal accumulation of neurofilaments in somata, dendrites and axonal spheroids may contribute to an abnormal transport and may impair protein turnover in the distal regions of Purkinje cells.",Immunology

Berberine is an alkaloid found in many plants, including the Coptis chinensis and Arcangelisia flava. Berberine has been reported to have cytostatic effect on tumor growth. Previously, we have found that the level of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) was significantly higher in hepatoma than in adjacent liver tissues. Using human HepG2 hepatoma cells, we have found that GR were expressed not only in G0-G1 phases, but also in S and G2+M phases. The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of berberine on the expression of GR and its relation to cell cycle progression of HepG2 cells. Continuous exposure of HepG2 cells to various concentrations (1-50 microM) of berberine resulted in growth inhibition in a dose dependent manner. The viability of berberine-treated HepG2 cells was greater than 90% in all treatment groups. Flowcytometric analysis of berberine-treated HepG2 cells showed that the S phase fraction was significantly reduced. GR levels were higher in berberine-treated HepG2 cells than in vehicle (DMSO)-treated cells. In addition, the secretion of alpha-fetoprotein by HepG2 cells was inhibited by berberine.

Peripheral blood lymphocytes from bovine leukemia virus (BLV)-negative and BLV-infected, aleukemic cows with persistent lymphocytosis were evaluated for expression of B and T lymphocyte subset-specific molecules and co-expression of the interleukin-2 receptor alpha (IL-2R alpha) molecule. Results demonstrate enhanced mitogen-induced expression of the IL-2R alpha molecule on B lymphocytes from BLV-infected, lymphocytotic cows. Lymphocyte subset analyses further demonstrate that BLV-infected, lymphocytotic cows are not only characterized by sustained elevations in CD5+ B lymphocytes, but also show significantly elevated numbers of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T lymphocytes. These results provide evidence suggesting that B lymphocytes from BLV-infected, lymphocytotic cows are more sensitive to activation signals and up-regulation of the IL-2 signaling pathway than lymphocytes from clinically normal BLV-free cows, and that T lymphocytes may be involved in the aberrant regulatory pathways underlying BLV-induced persistent B lymphocytosis.",Immunology

NE-10064 0.3-3 microM and sotalol 0.3-300 microM prolonged action potential duration at 90% of repolarization (APD90) and effective refractory period (ERP) concentration dependently without affecting APD50 under normal conditions. E-4031 0.3-300 microM prolonged APD50, APD90, and ERP concentration dependently.

7516016,"Is an intracellular renin-angiotensin system involved in control of cell communication in heart?. The possible influence of an intracellular renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on control of cell communication in heart muscle was investigated in cell pairs isolated from adult rats. Junctional conductance (gj) was measured with two separated voltage-clamp circuits. Intracellular dialysis of angiotensin I (AI 10(-8) M) caused a decrease in gj of 76% (SE +/- 3.4) (p < 0.05) in 7 min. The effect of AI appears to be due mainly to its conversion to AII because enalaprilat (10(-9) M) dialysed into the cell caused an appreciable reduction in the effect of AI. AII (10(-8) M) alone caused a decrease in gj of 60% (SE +/- 3.8) (p < 0.05) in 45 s. The effect of AII on gj was suppressed by previous inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC), but enalaprilat could not alter the effect of the peptide. The results indicate that synthesis of AII inside cardiac myocytes plays an important role in modulation of gj and consequently on propagation of the electrical impulse in heart. The effect of AII on gj was blocked by DuP-753 (10(-9) M) administered intracellularly, whereas (Sar1Val5AlA8) AII also caused a slight decrease (1.97 +/- 0.07%) in gj.

Isolated perfused rat kidney was used to examine the possible mechanisms involved in the hypotensive/vasodilator actions of cryptolepine. In kidneys preconstricted by phenylephrine (PE 5-7.5 x 10(-7) M), cryptolepine at bolus doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 micrograms elicited dose-dependent reductions in perfusion pressure by 29.8 +/- 4.1, 43.3 +/- 3.9, and 54.3 +/- 4.9 mm Hg, respectively. In the presence of indomethacin, cryptolepine-induced reduction in perfusion pressure was not significantly changed, suggesting a lack of a cyclooxygenase-mediated component in its renal vasodilator response. Removal of the endothelium with p-bromophenacyl bromide (p-BPB 10 microM) inhibited the vasodilator response to cryptolepine 2.5, 5, and 10 micrograms to 10.2 +/- 1.8, 15.9 +/- 1.5, and 20.2 +/- 2.0 mm Hg, respectively (p < 0.01). The vasodilator response to acetylcholine (ACh 50 ng) was also reduced from a control value of 56.7 +/- 4.5 to 15.3 +/- 1.9 mm Hg (p < 0.01); responses to sodium nitroprusside (SNP 5 micrograms) and isoprenaline (1 microgram) were not affected. In kidneys treated with hydroquinone (10(-5) and 10(-4) M), a specific inhibitor of endothelium-dependent vasodilation, cryptolepine- and ACh-induced vasodilation were inhibited dose dependently (p < 0.01). N omega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA 10(-5)-10(-4) M), a specific inhibitor of the synthesis/release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor/nitric oxide (EDRF/NO), attenuated the vasodilator response to cryptolepine and ACh (50 ng) dose dependently. At 10(-4) M L-NNA, cryptolepine-induced vasodilation was reduced to 6.6 +/- 2.2 (2.5 micrograms), 10.9 +/- 2.2 (5 micrograms), and 13.3 +/- 1.4 mm Hg (10 micrograms). L-Arginine (10(-4) and 3 x 10(-4) M) but not D-arginine (10(-4) M) inhibited the effects of L-NNA, with vasodilatory effects of cryptolepine returning to control values, suggesting that the vasodilator material released by cryptolepine is EDRF, possibly NO. Methylene blue (MB 10(-4) M), the inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase which inhibited 50 ng ACh and 5 micrograms SNP-induced vasodilation also reduced the vasodilatory responses to cryptolepine to 0.8 +/- 0.8 (2.5 micrograms), 4.2 +/- 4.2 (5 micrograms), and 10.8 +/- 6.2 mm Hg (10 micrograms) suggesting that the effector pathway for cryptolepine-induced vasodilation is soluble guanylate cyclase-linked increase in cyclic GMP of vascular smooth muscle.",Immunology

Mechanisms responsible for dual actions of nicardipine were examined using myocytes isolated from ventricular muscle of rat heart. About 60% of isolated rat myocytes showed positive force-frequency relationships. These cells had lower intracellular Ca2+ concentrations at rest. In the remaining cells that had higher resting Ca(2+)-concentrations, an increase in frequency of stimulation from 1 Hz to 2 Hz produced either no change or reduction in the amplitude of Ca2+ transients and twitch contractions. In 13 of 34 myocytes that showed positive force-frequency relationships, nicardipine enhanced the Ca2+ transient and produced sustained positive inotropic effects. In 11 of 20 cells that showed negative force-frequency relationships, nicardipine produced negative inotropic effects. Inhibition was partly reversed by an increase in extracellular CaCl2 concentration from 1.2 to 3.6 mM. In the remaining cells, nicardipine failed to either increase or decrease the amplitude of Ca2+ transient or twitch contraction. Bay K-8644 produced positive inotropic effects in most cells. These results indicate that nicardipine either enhances or inhibits Ca2+ transients and twitch contractions depending on the Ca2+ loading state of myocytes. The present results are consistent with the hypothesis that nicardipine stabilizes the state of Ca2+ channels, either in the inactivated state in cells that are well loaded with Ca2+, or in the activated state when the degree of Ca2+ loading is relatively low.",Immunology

Further advances in retroviral vaccine development require a better understanding of the antigenic structure of the envelope complex which is directly involved in infectivity events such as receptor recognition and membrane fusion. To design an optimal vaccine against BLV infection, we chose an approach based on the use of synthetic peptides covering 78% of the gp51 sequence in order to select only those segments that could induce a protective response via cellular and humoral immunity. On the other hand, we built a model of the BLV env glycoprotein 3D organization, based upon the very sensitive hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA). The major information highlighted from this model is that the two loops, against which the most efficient neutralizing antipeptides antibodies are directed against, are in close proximity at the top of the ""head"" and could represent a potential site for receptor binding. These two peptides are of particular interest since they induce also a helper T-cell response. We further propose that the BLV envelope glycoprotein oligomerizes as a trimer.",Immunology

Reverse transcription of the HIV RNA genome is thought to occur in the host cell cytoplasm after viral adsorption. However, viral DNA has been isolated in cell-free virus particles. We have quantitated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification the amount of viral DNA in virions as compared to RNA. Virus produced by proviral DNA transfections of cos-7 cells or by chronically-infected H9 cells; neither of which express the cell surface CD4 receptor, contained at least 1000 times more viral RNA than DNA. In contrast, only 60 times more RNA than DNA was present in virus particles produced by transfection of Jurkat cells, which were CD4-positive and thus potentially susceptible to superinfection. Protease-defective virus, carrying only the precursor of reverse transcriptase (RT) p160gag-pol, contained virtually no detectable DNA. These results indicate that only mature RT (p66/p51) and not its precursor (p160gag-pol) is responsible for the presence of viral DNA in HIV.",Immunology

Mice were immunized with separated monomeric and oligomeric HIV-1 Env glycoproteins to analyze the repertoire of antibody responses to the tertiary and quaternary structure of the protein. Hybridomas were generated and assayed for reactivity by immunoprecipitation of nondenatured Env protein. A total of 138 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were generated and cloned, 123 of which were derived from seven animals immunized with oligomeric Env. Within this group, a significant response was obtained against the gp41 ectodomain; 49 MAbs recognized epitopes in gp41, 82% of which were conformational. The influence of conformation on gp120 antigenicity was less pronounced, with 40% of the anti-gp120 MAbs binding to conformational epitopes, many of which blocked CD4 binding. Surprisingly, less than 7% of the MAbs derived from mice immunized with oligomeric Env recognized the V3 loop. In addition, MAbs to linear epitopes in the C-terminal domain of gp120 were not obtained, suggesting that this region of the protein may be partially masked in the oligomeric molecule. A total of 15 MAbs were obtained from two mice immunized with monomeric Env. Nearly half of these recognized the V3 loop, suggesting that this region may be a less predominant epitope in the context of oligomeric Env than in monomeric protein. Thus, immunization with oligomeric Env generates a large proportion of antibodies to conformational epitopes in both gp120 and gp41, many of which may be absent from monomeric Env.",Immunology

7511775,"The citrulline biosynthetic operon, argC-F, and a ribose transport operon, rbs, from Bacillus subtilis are negatively regulated by Spo0A. A method is described here that can be used to identify operons whose expression is controlled by any particular regulator protein. This method was used to identify operons whose expression is negatively regulated by Spo0A in Bacillus subtilis. Twenty-eight strains were identified, each of which contains an operon-lacZ transcriptional fusion, negatively regulated, either directly or indirectly, by Spo0A. In one of these strains (CSA8), the lacZ gene is fused to the argC-F operon positioned at 100 degrees on the B. subtilis chromosome. The regulated expression of this operon by Spo0A-P is mediated indirectly through the transition state regulator AbrB and is manifest only during growth on solid medium. In a second strain (CSA15), the lacZ gene is fused to an operon encoding a transport system which displays features characteristic of the ABC group of transporters, and which has a very high level of identity to the ribose transport system from Escherichia coli. Expression of the ribose transport operon is directed by a single SigA-type promoter. Transcription from this promoter is repressed by the phosphorylated form of Spo0A during the late-exponential/transition phase of the growth cycle and this control is not mediated through the transition-state regulator, AbrB.",Immunology
7511765,"Changes in the endothelial cyclooxygenase pathway in resistance arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Vasodilator responses to adenosine and acetylcholine (ACh) were studied in ring preparations of mesenteric resistance arteries of Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Adenosine (10(-7)-3 x 10(-4) M) caused relaxations in rings with endothelium. The relaxation was more pronounced in WKY than in SHR. Removal of the endothelium in WKY, but not in SHR, reduced the relaxation. In rings without endothelium, the relaxation was identical in the two strains. In WKY, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor meclofenamic acid attenuated the relaxation to adenosine in rings with endothelium but not in rings without endothelium. With meclofenamic acid, the relaxation was identical in WKY arteries with and without endothelium. ACh (10(-9)-10(-4) M) evoked endothelium-dependent relaxations in WKY. In contrast, in SHR the muscarinic agonist evoked contractions at higher concentrations (10(-6)-10(-4) M), whereas lower concentrations of ACh caused relaxations similar to those observed in WKY. The contraction in SHR was completely inhibited by meclofenamic acid, and with meclofenamic acid the relaxation to ACh was identical in WKY and SHR. Thus, adenosine evokes endothelium-dependent (through release of cyclooxygenase product) and endothelium-independent relaxations and ACh evokes endothelium-dependent relaxations in rat mesenteric resistance arteries. In SHR, the endothelium-dependent responses to the agonists are altered owing to the changes in the endothelial cyclooxygenase pathway.",Immunology
7511721,"Barium decreases defibrillation energy requirements. Certain antiarrhythmic drugs that inhibit myocardial repolarizing currents decrease defibrillation energy, but the effect of blocking particular currents on defibrillation is not well understood. We therefore investigated the effect of barium, a relatively selective blocker of inwardly rectifying potassium current (Ik1) on voltage and energy requirements for defibrillation in an open-chest dog model. Defibrillation energy and voltage requirements were assessed by delivering monophasic shocks through epicardial electrode patches at varying voltages to construct a dose-dependent curve of energy and voltage versus success in defibrillation. The energy and voltage for 50% success in defibrillation (E50 and V50, respectively) were determined by logistic regression. Monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization (MAPD90) was measured with a contact electrode, and ventricular refractory period (VERP) was measured. After baseline measurements were obtained of E50, V50, MAPD90, and VERP, saline (control) (n = 6) or barium (1.1 mg/kg/min for 5 min followed by 0.25 mg/kg/min) (n = 11) was administered. Defibrillation voltage and energy requirements and electrophysiologic measures were repeated after 30 and 120 min of barium or saline infusion. In control animals, there was no significant change with time in V50 (2.0 +/- 12.4 and -0.2 +/- 16.0% at 30 and 120 min, respectively), VERP (+3 +/- 5 and -2 +/- 3% at 30 and 120 min, respectively) or MAPD90 (+1 +/- 4 and -2 +/- 6, at 30 and 120 min, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology

Monocytes (m phi s) come into intimate contact with basement membranes and extracellular matrix proteins as they extravasate from the blood to the interstitium or to sites of tissue injury. We examined the in vitro effects of m phi adherence to an endothelial cell-derived basement membrane or to purified extracellular matrix proteins on phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated superoxide production and prostanoid secretion. Elutriation-purified human peripheral blood m phi s were adhered to tissue culture wells that were precoated with the following purified proteins: bovine serum albumin (BSA), collagen type I (COL I), collagen type IV (COL IV), fibronectin (FN), or laminin (LM). To model the provisional matrix at sites of tissue injury, m phi s were also adhered to wells coated with either denatured collagen type I or gelatin (GEL) or coated with basement membrane (BM) derived from endothelial cell monolayers. The m phi s were adhered to the protein-coated surfaces for 1 h at 37 degrees C in serum-free medium and washed to remove nonadherent cells, and the number of adherent m phi s was measured. Monolayers of m phi s were also incubated for an additional 18 h, at which time both adherence and cell spreading were measured. PMA-stimulated superoxide production by adherent m phi s was determined after 1 and 18 h of adherence to the protein-coated surfaces. PMA-stimulated release of two prostanoids, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) was measured after 18 h of m phi adherence to the surfaces. Following 18 h of adherence, PMA-stimulated superoxide anion secretion and secretion of PGE2 and TxB2 were augmented of primed by m phi s adherent to COL I, GEL, or BM. In contrast, no such priming effects were observed by m phi s adherent to COL IV, FN, or LM. The results suggest that adherence to basement membranes, collagen type I-containing surfaces in the interstitium, or denatured collagen at sites of tissue injury primes m phi respiratory burst and arachidonate metabolism to inflammatory agonists. Induction of priming events by substrate-specific adherence may be an important factor regulating host defense functions of m phi s in the extracellular matrix.",Immunology
7511661,"Role of HLA-A motifs in identification of potential CTL epitopes in human papillomavirus type 16 E6 and E7 proteins. We have measured the binding affinity for five HLA-A alleles: HLA-A1 (A*0101), A2.1 (A*0201), A3 (A*0301), A11 (A*1101), and A24 (A*2401); of a set of all possible nonamer peptides (n = 240) of human papillomavirus type 16 E6 and E7 proteins. High affinity binding peptides were identified for each of the alleles, thus allowing us to select several candidates for CTL-based vaccines. Moreover, this unbiased set of peptides allowed an evaluation of the predictive value of HLA motifs derived either from the analysis of sequencing of pools of naturally processed peptides or from the binding analysis of polyalanine nonameric peptides that differed in the amino acids (aa) present at the anchor positions. Whereas pool sequencing-derived motifs were present in only 27% of high affinity binders, the more expanded motif, based on analysis of different aa substitutions at the anchor positions, was present in 73% of high affinity binders. Furthermore, it was found that the presence of anchor residues in a peptide was in itself not sufficient to determine binding to MHC class I molecules, because the majority of motif-containing peptides failed to bind to the relevant MHC. Finally, specific HLA motifs were used to predict peptide binders of 8, 10, and 11 aa in length. Several high affinity binding peptides were identified for each of the various peptide lengths, indicating a significant size heterogeneity in peptides capable of high affinity binding to HLA-A molecules.",Immunology
7511651,"Histamine induces leukocyte rolling in post-capillary venules. A P-selectin-mediated event. The objective of this study was to systematically assess the molecular mechanisms and kinetics of histamine-induced leukocyte rolling in rat mesenteric venules using intravital microscopy. A complicating factor in these studies is surgical preparation-induced leukocyte rolling (spontaneous rolling), which leads to a lack of effect of histamine on this parameter. Therefore, we identified the source of the surgery-induced leukocyte rolling (partial mast cell degranulation) and established that pretreatment of animals with sodium cromoglycate (connective tissue mast cell stabilizer) inhibited spontaneous leukocyte rolling. Superfusion of the mast cell-stabilized rat mesentery with histamine caused a profound increase in leukocyte rolling which persisted for the entire hour of experimentation. Diphenhydramine (H1-receptor antagonist) but not cimetidine (H2-receptor antagonist) prevented the rise in histamine-induced leukocyte rolling. An anti-P-selectin Ab but not an anti-CD18 Ab reversed the histamine-induced leukocyte rolling in a dose-dependent fashion. In this model of low base line rolling, exposure of the mesentery to the chemotactic agent platelet-activating factor did not induce leukocyte rolling or adhesion. However, co-administration of histamine with platelet-activating factor did indeed promote leukocyte adhesion suggesting that the presence of at least one effector of P-selectin is a minimal requirement for chemotactically-stimulated leukocytes to adhere to postcapillary venules. This study demonstrates for the first time that histamine induces leukocyte rolling via a P-selectin-dependent mechanism in vivo. This is a prolonged, H1 receptor-mediated event that may contribute significantly to the early phase of inflammation.",Immunology
7511582,"Alp suppression of Lon: dependence on the slpA gene. We have previously found that plasmids carrying the Escherichia coli alp gene (now to be called alpA) suppress two phenotypes of a delta lon protease mutant, overproduction of capsular polysaccharide and sensitivity to UV light. Suppression of these lon phenotypes is most likely explained by the increased degradation of the Lon substrates responsible for these phenotypes. We have called this suppressing protease activity Alp protease. The Alp protease activity is detected in cells after introduction of plasmids carrying the alpA gene, which encodes an open reading frame of 70 amino acids. Insertions which abolish Alp activity interrupt this open reading frame. We have used Tn10 and lambda placMu mutagenesis to identify a chromosomal locus, slpA, that is required for alpA+ suppression of delta lon. This locus maps at 57 min, close to the chromosomal location of alpA. The expression of beta-galactosidase from a lac transcriptional fusion to slpA is increased six- to eightfold when the alpA+ gene is present on a multicopy plasmid. Therefore, AlpA acts as a transcriptional regulator of the slpA gene(s); activation of slpA transcription is necessary to suppress the phenotypes of a delta lon mutation. In an accompanying paper (J. E. Kirby, J. E. Trempy, and S. Gottesman, J. Bacteriol. 176:2068-2081, 1994), we show that neither AlpA nor SlpA is a component of the protease itself but that they are part of a regulatory cascade which leads to expression of the Alp protease.",Immunology

A Pseudomonas cepacia population was isolated which had reduced susceptibility to iodine and maintained resistance when subcultured several times in phosphate buffer. This population was also resistant to iodine after growth in a minimal medium containing glycerol but not glucose. Addition of cAMP to glucose-grown cells caused increased resistance to iodine. Iodine-resistant cultures also demonstrated reduced susceptibility to chlorination but not to heat or metals (Cu/Ag). The results indicate that halogen resistance can be expressed in varying degrees, dependent on the carbon source, and cAMP may promote this expression. Thus, a catabolite repression-like mechanism may cause resistant cultures grown in some media to become more sensitive to halogens.",Immunology
7511550,"Molecular analysis of anti-DNA antibodies. There are two major reasons for interest in antibodies to DNA: autoantibodies to DNA are characteristic of the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus and contribute to its pathology; and both autoantibodies and experimentally induced antibodies to nucleic acids serve as useful biochemical reagents. Physical biochemistry and molecular biology are applied increasingly to questions of the structure and origin of antibodies to DNA and how antibodies recognize specific structures in DNA. Cloning of cDNA for Ig V regions of anti-DNA antibodies reveals that some cells making IgG disease-related autoantibodies are derived from precursor cells that produce natural autoantibodies unrelated to disease. In addition, some immunization-induced antibodies to DNA use gene segments similar to those found in autoantibodies. Cloning and expression of recombinant V regions allow detailed analysis of antibody structures required for DNA binding. Domain swapping and mutagenesis with vectors for bacterial expression of single chain Fv molecules revealed the importance of CDR3 sites of both H and L chain V regions for specific antigen binding by antibody to Z-DNA. In certain autoantibodies, the H chain plays a dominant role in determining DNA binding. Molecular analysis opens doors to studies of normal immune tolerance and its loss in autoimmune disease as well as to development of antibodies with modified specificity.",Immunology

The role of triiodothyronine (T3) in the differentiation process of Ob1771 mouse preadipocyte cells has been studied under serum-free and hormone supplemented culture conditions which were previously shown to lead to terminal differentiation. In the absence of T3, a dramatic decrease in the adipogenic activity of the culture medium (EC50 = 0.1 nM) could be observed, as indicated 12 days after confluence by the low levels of late markers of differentiation such as adipsin, lipid-binding protein aP2 and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as well as the sharp reduction of the number of triacyglycerol-containing cells. This decrease in adipogenic activity was accompanied by a parallel increase of the mitogenic potency of the culture medium. Therefore, T3 appears to be a hormone capable of modulating both proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes. T3 ceased to be necessary provided the culture medium was supplemented with high concentrations of inducers of differentiation, such as 8-bromo-cAMP or carbaprostacyclin.",Immunology

To obtain insight in the effect of TNF on the synthesis of acute phase proteins like CRP, alpha 1-antitrypsine, alpha 1-acidglycoprotein, C3 and C4 and the immunoglobulins (IgG-M-A), nine cancer patients who were treated with an isolated limb perfusion (ILP) with high dose recombinant TNF-alpha (rTNF-alpha) were investigated during a 7-day period after the end of the perfusion. Resorption of rTNF-alpha from out of these limbs into the circulation after the ILP induced within 30 min to 6 h in all patients elevated serum levels of IL-6. At the same time C-reactive protein became detectable in serum. The highest serum levels were obtained at 48 h after ILP. The serum levels of the other acute phase proteins (alpha 1-acidglycoprotein, alpha 1-antirypsine, C3, C4), rose more slowly and the highest serum levels were found at the third day. All investigated proteins declined after they had reached their peak levels. Levels of alpha 1-acidglycoprotein and alpha 1-anti-trypsin alpha 1-acid declined slower than both complement component. In regard to the immunoglobulin levels a nearly continuous increase in the serum level of specifically IgM was observed. This study clearly shows the interrelationship between TNF-alpha and IL-6 in regard to the synthesis of the different acute phase proteins; and moreover also a striking effect on IgM synthesis.",Immunology

CD4+ T-lymphocytes induce and regulate allergic inflammatory responses to common environmental aeroallergens derived from Dermatophagoides spp. (house dust mite, HDM), which cause clinical symptoms in approximately 10% of the population. Definition of the molecular structure of HDM proteins combined with the ability to isolate monoclonal populations of human CD4+ T-cells representative of the 'interleukin-4 (IL-4) dominant' functional phenotype, which support immunoglobulin E (IgE) synthesis, has allowed T-cell recognition of HDM to be examined in detail. The results of these investigations demonstrated extensive heterogeneity in both the antigen and HLA class II restriction specificity of the HDM reactive T-cell repertoire. Furthermore, long-lived clones of T-cells with oligoclonality in T-cell antigen receptor (TcR) usage, driven by chronic stimulation with HDM, have been identified in human peripheral blood. The presentation of specific peptides and superantigens under conditions that induce T-cell non-responsiveness has provided an in vitro model for analysing the mechanisms of CD4+ T-cell targeted immunotherapy. It appears that the mechanisms underlying T-cell anergy are accompanied by a transient downregulation of TcR and CD28 and mediated by a shift in the cytokine profile from that of the 'IL-4 dominant' to the 'interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) dominant' functional phenotype of CD4+ T-cells. In parallel, using a murine model, it has been demonstrated that administration of an immunodominant peptide via the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory and alimentary tracts may tolerize an established response to intact HDM proteins. The potential application of these models in the development of novel approaches to immunotherapy is discussed.",Immunology
7511518,"The polarity of the induced electric field influences magnetic coil inhibition of human visual cortex: implications for the site of excitation. Human perception of 3 briefly flashed letters in a horizontal array that subtends a visual angle of 3 degrees or less is reduced by a magnetic coil (MC) pulse given, e.g., 90 msec later. Either a round or a double square MC is effective when the lower windings or central junction region, respectively, are tangential to the skull overlying calcarine cortex and symmetrical across the midline. The modeled, induced electric field has peak amplitude at the midline, but the peak spatial derivatives lie many centimeters laterally. Thus, the foveal representation near the midline is closer to the peak electric field than to its peak spatial derivatives, i.e., excitation of calcarine cortex differs from excitation of a straight nerve. With an MC pulse that induces an electric field which is substantially monophasic in amplitude, the lateral-most letter (usually the right-hand letter) in the trigram is preferentially suppressed when the electric field in the contralateral occipital lobe is directed towards the midline. Inferences from using peripheral nerve models imply that medially located bends in geniculo-calcarine or corticofugal fibers are the relevant sites of excitation in visual suppression; end excitation of fiber arborizations or apical dendrites is considered less likely. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the induced electric field polarity in paracentral lobule for optimally eliciting foot movements is opposite to that for visual suppression, the major bends occurring at different portions of the fiber trajectories in the two systems.",Immunology

Administration of 10% Rheodextran induced an 8.3-fold increase of lymph flow and enhanced also the protein transport in the lymph. The permeability of pulmonary endothelial vascular walls was deranged. Isooncotic 3.4% Rheodextran provided adequate transcapillary exchange of fluids in the lungs and proved to be the suitable solution for substitution of blood losses.

Electrophysiologic effects of ATP-sensitive K+ channel openers (cromakalim, pinacidil, and nicorandil) in single rabbit sino-atrial (SA) node cells were examined by a whole-cell voltage- and current-clamp technique. Cromakalim (> 30 microM), pinacidil (> 1 microM), and nicorandil (> 500 microM) caused a negative chronotropic effect. At low concentrations, the maximum diastolic potential was hyperpolarized and the maximum rate of depolarization was enhanced, but at high concentrations, both were reversed and action potential amplitude (APA) was decreased significantly. Pinacidil (> 30 microM) and nicorandil (> 3 microM) prolonged AP duration (APD), but cromakalim did not affect it. In whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments, cromakalim (100 microM), pinacidil (> 30 microM), and nicorandil (> 300 microM) inhibited the Ca2+ current significantly but had little or no effect on the delayed rectifying K+ current and the hyperpolarization-activated inward current. Glibenclamide (1 microM) did not antagonize the effects of K+ channel openers on Ca2+ current and APs. These results indicate that the K+ channel openers have direct inhibitory actions on spontaneous APs and Ca2+ current in rabbit SA node cells (but K+ current was unaffected), resulting in decreased pacemaker activity.",Immunology

Roentgen-cephalometric studies were carried out in 26 adult males with complete bilateral cleft lip and palate. They were subdivided two times in two subgroups, with and without premaxillary setback, and with and without prolongation of the columella. The subgroups were compared mutually, as well as with a group of controls including 50 males matched in age. Premaxillary setback during childhood resulted in a more marked retrusion of the maxilla in adulthood. A simultaneous slighter oral slope of the premaxilla led to a normalization of the upper face height. Skeletal deviations acted on the configuration of the soft profile, in particular of the nasolabial transition: the slope of the columella towards the profile was reduced and so was the nasolabial angle. Thus the region appeared more markedly sunken. This surgical procedure should be used only in an exceptional situation in a small or posteriorly rotated mandible. Prolongation of the columella resulted in an excessive nasal depth. This was not caused by an adequate elevation of the tip of the nose which corrected a flattening of the tip, but rather by the sunken upper lip. An unfavourable effect exerted also a larger deepening of the nasolabial transition after a prolongation of the columella. However a slighter prolongation of the columella did not allow a sufficient elevation of the nasal tip. It is therefore necessary to seek a compromise.",Immunology

PSA screening results in increased detection of localized disease. In individual patients a serum PSA level is not a good indicator of pathologic stage; however, a serum PSA level of greater than 10 ng/mL is associated with a higher incidence of extracapsular disease. Asymptomatic patients with newly diagnosed untreated prostate cancer and a serum PSA level less than 10 ng/mL do not need to undergo staging radionuclide bone scan. Elevated serum PSA is generally the first indicator of ""persistent disease"" after radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy.

We previously reported that a peptide with the sequence Gly-Ala-Pro-Leu (GAPL) found as residues 309-312 in glycoprotein IIb alpha (GPIIb) comprises at least part of a Fg binding site on GPIIb (1). Subsequent studies demonstrated that a peptide corresponding to residues 300-312 of GPIIb alpha can bind to Fg and Vn, and is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation and the adhesion of activated platelets to at least four adhesive ligands: Fg, Fn, Vn, and vWf (2).

DNP-BSA induced cell alkalinization was fully inhibited by azelastine with IC50 (1.6 +/- 0.5 mumol/l, mean +/- SEM, n = 5) similar to that required to inhibit histamine release (1.4 mumol/l). Conversely, high azelastine concentrations (> 100 mumol/l) were required to inhibit DNP-BSA-dependent cell calcium mobilization (IC50 approximately 200 mumol/l, n = 3). Amiloride, but not the H1 histamine antagonist pyrilamine, was able to inhibit the DNP-BSA induced pH signal. In acidified mast cells, azelastine potently inhibited Na+:H+ exchange activity (IC50 = 7.7 +/- 3.6 x 10(-6) M, mean +/- SEM, n = 3). Conversely, in mouse spleen lymphocytes azelastine was unable to inhibit the amiloride-sensitive pH signal induced by concanavalin A.

Recent immunocytochemical studies of cerebellar nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cGMP have aided dramatically in defining possible cellular sources of cGMP generation in the signal transduction cascade evoked by excitatory amino acids in the cerebellum. Using a mouse mutant deficient in cerebellar Purkinje cells (""nervous"" mouse) and chemical lesions of cerebellar neurons with methylazoxymethanol (MAM), we have examined in vivo generation of cGMP to determine the roles of different cerebellar neuronal populations. In the case of ""nervous"" mice, our data indicate that cerebellar Purkinje cells are not required for NMDA-dependent increases in cGMP in the cerebellum. In marked contrast, MAM lesions which reduce granule but not Golgi cells in the granule cell layer and reduce basket and stellate cells in the molecular layer, dramatically reduced the ability of NMDA to increase cerebellar cGMP.

The more advanced the carcinomas, or the higher the grade of atypia of adenomas, the fewer the lesions of which goblet cell mucus (GCM) and the mucus at the luminal surface or that in the luminal accumulation (SC) stained red. SC frequently stained bluer than GCM in highly atypical glands. The staining properties of benign adenomatous portions concomitant with submucosal or mucosal carcinomas were similar to those of benign adenomas, but not to their carcinomatous foci.

7509172,"Reversal of selenium and zinc deficiencies in chronic hemodialysis patients by intravenous sodium selenite and zinc gluconate supplementation. Time-course of glutathione peroxidase repletion and lipid peroxidation decrease. In six chronic dialyzed uremic patients, an intravenous sodium selenite (Se 50 micrograms during 5 wk and then 100 micrograms) and zinc gluconate (Zn 5 mg) supplementation was performed during 20 wk at each dialysis session three times weekly. Before supplementation, plasma Se and Zn, plasma and erythrocytes (RBC) antioxidant metallo-enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly decreased, whereas lipid peroxidation (as thiobarbituric acid reactants TBARs) was increased. To obtain a significative change in plasma selenium, we had to use an Se dose of 100 micrograms/dialysis session. Then, treatment-increased plasma Se (from 0.58 +/- 0.09 to 0.89 +/- 0.16 mumol/L) led to a repletion of RBC-GPX (from 29.6 +/- 6 to 43 +/- 5.8 U/g Hb) and increased plasma GPX levels (from 62 +/- 13 to 151 +/- 43 U/L). Plasma Zn and RBC-SOD did not vary significantly. The change of TBARs was not observed between wk 1 and 4. They decreased significantly between wk 4 (4.80 +/- 0.21 mumol/L) and wk 20 (4.16 +/- 0.26 mumol/L). We noted a low correlation between TBARs and plasma GPX. A strong correlation was observed between Se and plasma GPX. The reversal of Se deficiencies should reduce oxidative damage observed in these patients.",Immunology
7509147,"Characterization of magnesium efflux from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. Magnesium efflux from intact Ehrlich ascites tumor cells (EATC) has been characterized under 0-trans conditions. It is shown that a magnesium-extruding mechanism operates in these cells which brings about magnesium efflux up to 20% of the cell total content. EATC magnesium efflux is independent from extracellular Ca2+ and its apparent velocity is not affected by [Mg2+]o up to 160 microM. This extrusion, however, is strictly dependent on extracellular Na+ and it is inhibited by ouabain (1 mM), amiloride (1 mM), imipramine (0.5 mM) and quinidine (1 mM). It is not affected by HMA (5-N,N-hexamethylene) amiloride) (0.5 microM) and vanadate (0.1 mM). Bumetanide (0.5 mM) enhances magnesium extrusion in these cells. EATC magnesium extrusion can be significantly stimulated by db cAMP, forskolin, and IBX (3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine). The intracellular magnesium distribution, studied also by means of the ionophore A23187, is regulated by energy metabolism and cell ATP content. Altogether our data demonstrate that EATC exhibit a magnesium extrusion sustained by Na+ gradient across the plasma membrane and carried out by a Na+/Mg2+ antiport. In these cells magnesium homoeostasis results, regulated efficiently by cell ATP and cAMP content.",Immunology

7509039,"Gene interactions affecting mechanosensory transduction in Caenorhabditis elegans. Genetic screening has identified a group of mec (mechanosensory) genes that are required for the function of a set of six touch-receptor neurons in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Such genes potentially encode components of the mechanosensory apparatus. We have cloned one of these genes, mec-10, which is a member of the degenerin gene family (genes such as mec-4 and deg-1 that can be mutated to cause neurodegeneration). Because components of an amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (alpha, beta and gamma rENaC) from rat share considerable sequence similarity with the C. elegans genes, it is likely that degenerins may function as channel proteins. Here we show that two degenerin homologues (mec-4 and mec-10) are expressed in the same cells, although each provides a unique function. Based on genetic data of mutations affecting mec-10-induced degeneration, we propose that the products of three genes (mec-4, mec-10 and mec-6) form a complex needed for mechanosensation, and that several other mec genes may be important in regulating the putative channel complex.",Immunology

7507800,"Role of phosphorylation in keratin and vimentin filament integrity in cultured thyroid epithelial cells. Cytokeratin and vimentin intermediate filaments (IFs) possess relatively stable polymeric properties which can be affected by phosphorylation. The present study, using cultures of thyroid epithelial cells, shows by indirect immunofluorescence that these cells contain both keratin tonofilament and vimentin IF complexes. Immunoblots of Triton X-100 insoluble cytoskeletal fractions show vimentin, and approximately 52 kDa type II and 40/38 kDa type I keratins. Under ""basal"" conditions, following prelabeling of cells with [32PO4], vimentin is not significantly phosphorylated, while both type II and I keratins are phosphorylated. Treatment of cells for 20 min with 1 mM dbcAMP or 0.4 microM 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), to stimulate protein kinase A and C, respectively, has no effect on either the phosphorylation state or cytoplasmic filament integrity of vimentin. However, while dbcAMP also does not affect keratin filaments, TPA increases both type II and I phosphorylation approximately 3-fold, and concomitantly disrupts tonofilament complexes associated with the nucleus, cytoplasm, and desmosomes. TPA-treated cells also show dramatic shape changes and protrusive activity. Tryptic peptide mappings show phosphorylations of at least 6 and approximately 2 additional sites for type II and I keratins, respectively, vs. [32P]-peptides from control cells. Treatment of [32PO4]-labeled cells with 0.4 microM calyculin A to inhibit types 1 and 2A phosphatase activity causes hyperphosphorylation of both vimentin and keratin, disruption of IF complexes, and actomyosin/cell contraction within 20 min. Quantitatively, approximately 50% of the type II/I keratin hyperphosphorylations are at some sites apparently also phosphorylated after TPA treatment. Thus, in these cells, IFs are specifically and differentially affected and regulated by the activity of several kinases.",Immunology

To avoid the confusion caused by another gene with the same name, we renamed v-ryk to be v-eyk, thereby changing the proto-oncogene's name to c-eyk. c-eyk is expressed highly in chicken spleen and moderately in many other tissues including embryonic tissues. Its cDNA is 3061 base pairs encoding a receptor-type protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) of 974 amino acids. Compared to c-Eyk, v-Eyk is a truncated PTK lacking the extracellular and transmembrane regions of c-Eyk in addition to two amino acid changes. c-Eyk has two C2-type Ig domains and two FN-III domains in its extracellular region, forming a new subfamily of receptor-type PTK together with UFO/Axl/Ark.

7507350,"Expression of the HNK-1 epitope is unaltered among early chick epiblast cells despite behavioral transformation by inducing factors in vitro. Dissociated epiblast cells from pre-streak chick blastoderms have been exposed, in short-term culture on a fibronectin (FN) substratum, to recombinant mammalian activin and to mammalian basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Such cultures have also been made on this substratum pre-conditioned by culture of a transfected cell line expressing the mammalian Wnt-1 gene. The former two factors induce changes of FN adhesiveness and other behavior, such that the cultures after 6 h resemble cultures newly set up from the young primitive streak or substreak hypoblast region of similarly aged blastoderms that have developed onward across the intervening period (see Cooke and Wong, Development 111: 197-212, 1991 for related results). Over 95% of cells are potentially responsive, and with relatively high concentration of activin there is also production of nodular structures due to strong cell-cell adhesion, as in cultures from Hensen's node or the anterior streak. Pre-conditioning of the substratum by transfected Wnt-1-expressing cells does not appear specifically to alter behavior in such epiblast cultures, though these experimental cells, and not control-transfected ones, produce striking alterations of chick development in other experiments (Cooke et al., in preparation). Up to 20% of cells in control cultures from central or 'marginal zone' pre-streak epiblast express the HNK-1 epitope, while up to 60% of cultured early streak cells cleaned of hypoblast do so.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology

Among the 2 treatment groups comprising 99 evaluable patients, demographic analysis of age, weight and height did not reveal statistically significant differences. Evaluation of fever, pain, inflammation and nasal obstruction over the 8-day treatment period showed a significant improvement in these parameters for those patients treated with nimesulide when compared with naproxen from day 1, with remission of symptoms starting from day 3. These findings were complemented by a superior tolerability profile reported for nimesulide-treated patients.

We have investigated the connectivity of the AP and adjacent solitary complex (SC) to identify possible sites of the motor emetic center. The AP and SC were infused with HRP or WGA-HRP in 30 ferrets that were perfused transcardially after 24-72 h. A block from the pons to upper cervical spinal cord, and one with hypothalamus and basal forebrain, was cut at 50 microns, reacted, and mounted. Data support the conclusion, at variance with those from other preparations, that in ferrets the AP has reciprocal connections only with the SC, which serves as a relay in both ascending and descending pathways between AP and higher levels of the neuraxis. Connectivity of the SC with brain stem and forebrain structures including the rostral ventrolateral medulla, parabrachial nuclei, paraventricular nucleus, and amygdala was demonstrated. At least in ferrets, our results suggest that the motor emetic center must be located within the SC. While this may not apply to all species, it is also possible that some reports of AP projections elsewhere were results of label within the SC. Alternatively, the somewhat different pattern of emesis in the ferret as compared to the dog (greater role for vagal inputs in response to radiation and cytotoxic drugs, lesser role for humoral inputs) may reflect differences in AP connectivity.",Immunology
7506065,"Preventing errors when estimating single channel properties from the analysis of current fluctuations. The conductance, number, and mean open time of ion channels can be estimated from fluctuations in membrane current. To examine potential errors associated with fluctuation analysis, we simulated ensemble currents and estimated single channel properties. The number (N) and amplitude (i) of the underlying single channels were estimated using nonstationary fluctuation analysis, while mean open time was estimated using covariance and spectral analysis. Both excessive filtering and the analysis of segments of current that were too brief led to underestimates of i and overestimates of N. Setting the low-pass cut-off frequency of the filter to greater than five times the inverse of the effective mean channel open time (burst duration) and analyzing segments of current that were at least 80 times the effective mean channel open time reduced the errors to < 2%. With excessive filtering, Butterworth filtering gave up to 10% less error in estimating i and N than Bessel filtering. Estimates of mean open time obtained from the time constant of decay of the covariance, tau obs, at low open probabilities (Po) were much less sensitive to filtering than estimates of i and N. Extrapolating plots of tau obs versus mean current to the ordinate provided a method to estimate mean open time from data obtained at higher Po, where tau obs no longer represents mean open time. Bessel filtering gave the least error when estimating tau obs from the decay of the covariance function, and Butterworth filtering gave the least error when estimating tau obs from spectral density functions.",Immunology

However, to our knowledge no accurate determination of fluid absorption during laser prostatectomy has been performed to date. A technique previously described to determine the amount of irrigant absorbed during transurethral resection of the prostate measures breath ethanol levels using a standard alcohol breath analyzer during the procedure after a predetermined amount of ethanol is added to the irrigant fluid. This method was used in 4 men undergoing laser prostatectomy. All 4 subjects had ethanol levels of 0 throughout the operation, indicating that little or no irrigant fluid was absorbed. We demonstrated in a quantitative manner that fluid absorption during laser prostatectomy is almost nil and patients are, indeed, at no risk for the transurethral resection syndrome.",Immunology

We investigated the use of ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate in treatment of rats bearing Morris hepatoma 7777. Rats received diets containing either ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate, which has been used in other catabolic states (i.e. injury, sepsis), or an isonitrogenous, isocaloric diet containing glycine. Untreated tumors grew to a mass of 11 g/100 g body weight over the 3-wk period after implantation and induced progressive anorexia, negative nitrogen balance, and body and tissue wasting. Compared with glycine, ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate had no effect on tumor growth, but also did not alter the catabolic effects of the tumor on its host. We hypothesized that capture of amino acids by the tumor limited the efficacy of supplemental nutrition here and in published reports in which tumor burden comprised 4-30% of body weight. This is supported by our observation that a 3-wk of implantation the rate of protein deposition plus amino acid oxidation by the tumor was equivalent to approximately 70% of the host's daily protein intake. To parallel the clinical situation in which tumor burden is small at diagnosis and initiation of treatment, the same diets were tested in rats treated by excision of the tumor at a limited stage of the disease. Rats received 3 d preoperative nutrition with ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate or glycine, and continued on the same diets for 3 or 6 d postoperatively. Compared with glycine-fed rats, ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate-fed rats showed a more positive nitrogen balance, higher concentrations of glutamine and branched-chain amino acids in muscle, and accelerated protein deposition in small intestine (P < 0.05).

7500169,"Characterization of a novel protein in chick intestine that exhibits calcium-binding activity and regulation by dietary calcium, aluminum and vitamin D. The molecular mechanisms stimulated by vitamin D and low calcium diets that promote intestinal calcium absorption are not fully understood.

Duodenal mucosal scrapings were obtained and screened for changes in protein composition using SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. The relative amount of a previously unreported 400-kDa oligomer containing 22-kDa monomeric subunits was found to vary directly with theoretical changes in the efficiency of Ca absorption, i.e., amounts increased with low Ca intakes and repletion with 1,25(OH)2D3, but were decreased by dietary aluminum and vitamin D deficiency. The oligomer was shown to have Ca-binding activity using a 45Ca overlay technique. These properties suggest 1) that the protein is regulated, at least indirectly, by 1,25(OH)2D3; 2) that the protein may play a role in promoting Ca absorption, possibly by binding Ca; and 3) that dietary aluminum interferes with the regulation of this protein, possibly by interfering with the actions of vitamin D in the intestine.",Immunology

Projection of these neurons onto the flocculus was verified with retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase after injections in the flocculus. 2. Bipolar stimulation electrodes were implanted into the ""middle"" zone of each flocculus because this zone is known to be involved in the control of horizontal eye movements.

The extent to which heterosynaptic and prime-associative stimulation protocols generate different forms of long-term depression (LTD) was assessed in the lateral perforant path synapses terminating on dentate gyrus granule cells in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. 2. Heterosynaptic LTD was induced in the lateral path by repeated tetanization of the medial path. Prime-associative LTD of the lateral path was induced by alternating high-frequency conditioning trains to the medial path and single shocks to the lateral path at 100-ms intervals, all occurring 10 min after priming stimulation of the lateral path (5 Hz, 80 pulses). 3. Induction of LTD by one administration of the prime-associative protocol was normally greater in magnitude than the LTD induced by the heterosynaptic protocol. Saturation of LTD by repeated delivery of the prime-associative protocol completely occluded the subsequent induction of LTD by the heterosynaptic protocol. Saturation of LTD by repeated delivery of the heterosynaptic protocol produced an 80% occlusion of the LTD generated by the prime-associative protocol. 4.

The timing of rhythmic flexor and extensor discharge was consistent with that seen during overground locomotion in 27% of 84 bath applications of these substances (n = 65 preparations). 2. Subsequent addition of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol, the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen, or glycine, abolished rhythmic activity in 95% of the tested applications. 3. GABAB receptor blockade did not disrupt alternating patterns of ENG discharge. However, addition of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline, or the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine, transformed alternating flexor-extensor and left-right activity into patterns characterized by bilaterally synchronous rhythmic activation of all hindlimb ENGs. The onset of individual ENG bursts was more abrupt following bicuculline or strychnine. Strychnine also synchronized high-frequency (4-8 Hz) packets of rhythmic discharge within ENG bursts. 4. Some preparations developed synchronous, but unstable, rhythmic activity in the presence of bicuculline or strychnine alone.

The aim of this study was to investigate the biliary excretion of LPS using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled LPS. After FITC-LPS was injected intravenously into rats, the cellular localization of fluorescence in the liver was examined and the biliary excretion of fluorescence was measured. The effects of gadolinium chloride, a blocker of Kupffer cells, and colchicine, an inhibitor of microtubules, on the biliary excretion of fluorescence was investigated, and bile was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. Laser scanning confocal microscopy showed that fluorescence was taken up by hepatocytes 5 minutes after injection of FITC-LPS into the portal vein. When FITC-LPS was injected into the portal vein, fluorescence was rapidly secreted into bile, peaking at 20 minutes, and 25.1% of the injected dose appeared in bile within 60 minutes. When the same dose of FITC-LPS was injected into the tail vein, 15.8% appeared in bile within 60 minutes. Chromatography showed that FITC-LPS was excreted into bile in an unchanged form over a period of 20 minutes after injection. Colchicine significantly reduced the biliary excretion of fluorescence, but gadolinium chloride had no effect.

In the past, the left atrial appendage has been considered a ""useless"" structure but associated to thromboembolic complications; its physiologic role is still undefined. Owing to its great distensibility, left atrial appendage positively influences atrial compliance and left ventricular performances. In addition this structure seems to play an important role in circulatory homeostasis by the release of atrial natriuretic factor in response to volume loading and atrial stretch. Transesophageal echocardiography provides a detailed anatomical characterization of this structure and, by means of Doppler flow velocities recordings, supplies relevant functional data. Despite their anatomical contiguity, the left atrium and atrial appendage result from a separate embryonic development; likewise, their function may differentiate. In the left atrial appendage a quadriphasic flow pattern has been described in subjects with sinus rhythm; however, as we reported, in some patients a more complex Doppler pattern can be observed, with an additional systolic forward flow wave which is presumably due to reflection phenomena. In patients with atrial fibrillation, an irregular flow pattern has been detected, which is mostly dependent on the duration of the arrhythmia, the underlying heart disease and the left atrial pressure. By transesophageal echocardiography a clear correlation has been established between the left atrial appendage slow flow and the occurrence of thromboembolic events; however, while waiting data from large studies, stratification of patients according to thromboembolic risk and decisions about anticoagulant prophylaxis should be performed by clinical information and transthoracic echocardiographic findings. No clinical or echocardiographic parameter has been found to be predictive of the thromboembolic events after cardioversion; in this setting the exclusion of atrial or atrial appendage thrombi by transesophageal echocardiography does not rule out the need for anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing electrical or pharmacological cardioversion.",Immunology

Cytogenetic and molecular genetic studies have implicated many chromosomal aberrations in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Deletions on 3p and 9p are presently the primary target for positional cloning of putative tumor suppressor genes. We have recently reported frequent loss of heterozygosity in three separate regions (HRAS, D11S12, D11S16) on 11p in freshly resected lung cancer specimens. Here we report cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses of 26 permanently growing human lung cancer cell lines. Deletions indicating regions which may harbor potential tumor suppressor genes were found in 5/9 cell lines on 2p, 5/9 on 2q, 6/9 on 3p, 7/9 on 3q, 5/9 on 6q, 3/9 on 9p, 5/9 on 11p, and 6/9 on 13q. Reduction to hemizygosity or a statistically significant increase in the frequency of homozygosity on 11p was found for all markers investigated except for ST5 (D11S832E). Eight of twenty-six (31%) cell lines were hemizygous for D11S12 and 9/26 (35%) for D11S16. Seventeen of eighteen (94%) cell lines were homozygous for PTH (expected homozygosity, 53%), 15/15 (100%) for WT1 (expected homozygosity, 55%), and 16/18 (89%) for CAT (expected homozygosity, 50%). These results confirm the notion that 11p harbors several putative tumor suppressor genes which may become inactivated at different stages of tumor development and progression. They also provide a basis for selecting cell lines for genetic complementation specifically targeted at the regions described.",Immunology

From 1990 to 1994, 3 patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in whom light microscopy and cytochemistry suggested a FAB subtype M3 variant were observed at our Institute. Immunophenotype showed HLA-DR-, CD13+, CD33+, CD2+, CD9+; promyelocytic features were also detected by electron microscopy. However, leukemic cells lacked both translocation t(15;17) and RAR alpha/PML genes rearrangement. These cases were considered to be 'M2 atypical' subtypes and they contribute to point out how cytogenetics and molecular biology are mandatory for a correct diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) particularly because therapy with all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is now the best treatment for APL. Nevertheless these 3 cases indicate that the atypical M2 subtype may be confused with the M3v if only cytochemistry, immunophenotype and electron microscopy are used in the defining the FAB subtypes.",Immunology
7495149,"[The regulation of food consumption (the ontogenetic aspects)]. The present-day concepts of organizing the physiologic system of food consumption control at different stages of ontogenesis of the premature born mammals are discussed with an element of criticism. The ""alimentary center"" notion as a multilevel system of the perceptive neurons lost its original significance and needs improvement. An idea of hypothalamic alimentary centers also needs revision to match the recent detection of many brain structures which are associated with the development of hunger and repletion states. There is no strong evidence of a direct involvement of central reception of metabolic products in an immediate control of the alimentary behavior. The hunger and repletion theories each only in part explain the physiologic basis of these states. The alimentary behavior is an integrated process not coming to a consummatory act. It relates to a complex interaction of afferent and efferent systems which are different at various stages of ontogenesis. In an early period of life the regulation of alimentary behavior depends mainly on the sensory signals and only gradually it incorporates the metabolic canal of signalling. A delay in the repletion mechanisms provides the optimal conditions for the growth and development of organism. The formation of alimentary stereotypes on the basis of specific and nonspecific factors is described. Regulation of different aspects of alimentary behavior depends finally on their relation to the state of brain systems of reward and punishment.",Immunology
7494907,"Need to revise the national drinking water regulation for copper. Copper is an essential micronutrient and a potential toxic metal. The USEPA current maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG, a nonenforceable aspirational health goal) and the required treatment technique action level, both set at 1.3 mg/liter of copper are not adequately protective for infants and children under 10 years of age. Infants and children up to 10 years of age have increased susceptibility to copper toxicity. The two main reasons for the high sensitivity in this population subgroup are the presence of a normally high concentration of copper in the liver during early life and the lack of a fully developed homeostatic mechanism of copper in children under 10 years of age. This sensitive group of infants and children represents approximately 17% of the total U.S. population. The adverse health effects caused by drinking water contaminated with copper are abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and dizziness. The proposed drinking water guideline of 0.3 mg/liter for copper was derived by the application of the risk assessment procedures approved by the USEPA. Drinking water containing 0.3 mg/liter of copper will provide approximately 26% of the nutritional requirement of copper.

Although 2,4-dinitrophenol inhibited neither the association nor internalization of fractionated 3H-heparin, lowering the temperature from 37 degrees C to 4 degrees C reduced the internalization of fractionated 3H-heparin by 70% without affecting the association. It is suggested that the uptake mechanism may differ from receptor-mediated endocytosis of polypeptides and be mediated by scavenger receptors, because organic anions, and several ligands of scavenger receptors, as well as several heparin analogs, inhibit the binding of fractionated 3H-heparin to Kupffer cells, while phenylarsine oxide, which is known to inhibit the receptor-mediated or absorptive endocytosis of polypeptides, inhibits neither the association nor internalization of fractionated 3H-heparin.",Immunology

The substantia nigra is explained as a TV-broadcasting system, the nerve fibers to the so-called striatum as cables and the striatum itself is explained as a TV-set with 2 channels (called dopamine D 1-receptor and dopamine D 2-receptor). The action of anti-Parkinsonian agents is exemplified with the substance L-DOPA, a precursor of the transmitter dopamine. The patient and his partner are introduced to the time-course of the L-DOPA concentration in blood after oral intake of the substance (the pharmacokinetics of L-DOPA).

ACP is a deliberative and communicative process that helps people formulate and communicate preferences for future medical care in the event of mental incapacity. Advance directives are mechanisms for communicating and/or documenting ACP, and are either instructional (e.g. statement of treatment preferences in living wills) or proxy types (e.g. appointment of another person to speak on the patient's behalf). ACP discussions between patients and health care providers and patient-orientated educational ACP materials often ignore insights from 2 related activities, health promotion and human information processing.

7494736,"Interdisciplinary and intersectoral approach: a challenge for integrated care. Integrated care for health disorders, particularly chronic diseases, is a long-term and complex challenge, particularly because of the involvement of many individuals with different beliefs, attitudes, assumptions and reward structures. Two basic conceptual models of disease--the biomedical and psychosocial--underlie many of these differences. The biomedical model views humans as the sum of multiple individual 'subsystems,' and disease represents dysfunction of one or more of these subsystems. This model is 'reductionist' and 'individualistic' in nature in that if 'THE' defective subsystem can be identified, studied and improved, it is assumed that health would return. The biomedical model focuses primarily on the individual with ill-health and has added greatly to our basic understanding of disease processes. The psychosocial model is 'interactive' and dynamic, and sees the 'whole' as more than the sum of its parts. This model values elements outside of the individual, e.g. work and home environment, as important in maintaining or establishing health. Because of fundamental differences between these 2 models of health and disease, conflicts, e.g. efficacy vs. exposure; role of individual vs. environment; etc., may exist among varying professionals regarding the nature, purpose, targets, structure, and consequences of integrated care programs. These fundamental conflicts, if unrecognized and ignored, can significantly attenuate the benefits of well-intentioned prevention and treatment integrated care programs.",Immunology

To develop computer software that assists the planner avoid potential gantry collisions with the patient or patient support assembly during the treatment planning process. The approach uses a simulation of the therapy room with a scale model of the treatment machine. Because the dimensions of the machine and patient are known, one can calculate a priori whether any desired therapy field is possible or will result in a collision. To assist the planner, we have developed a graphical interface enabling the accurate visualization of each treatment field configuration within a ""room's eye view"" treatment planning window. This enables the planner to be aware of, and alleviate any potential collision hazards. To circumvent blind spots in the graphic representation, an analytical software module precomputes whether each update of the gantry or turntable position is safe. If a collision is detected, the module alerts the planner and suggests collision evasive actions such as either an extended distance treatment or the gantry angle of closest approach. The model enables the planner to experiment with unconventional noncoplanar treatment fields, and immediately test their feasibility.",Immunology

While quadrupedal running and leaping requires flexion and extension of the spine, slow climbing quadrupedalism in lorisids depends on spinal lateral flexion and rotation. The contrasting development of the epaxial musculature in the two species dissected reflects these different requirements. Bipedal suspension is a common posture in the lorisids during which rotation and dorsiflexion of the head is made possible by the robustly developed deep, dorsal, cervical musculature.

Two microtubule-stimulated ATPases, cytoplasmic dynein, and kinesin, are believed to be responsible for the intracellular movement of membrane-bound organelles in opposite directions along microtubules. An unresolved component of this model is the mechanism by which cells regulate these two motors to direct various membrane-bound organelles to their proper locations. To determine if phosphorylation may play a role in the regulation of cytoplasmic dynein, the in vivo phosphorylation state of cytoplasmic dynein from two cellular pools was examined. The entire cellular pool of brain cytoplasmic dynein was metabolically labeled by the infusion of [32P]orthophosphate into the cerebrospinal fluid of rat brain ventricles. To characterize the phosphorylation of dynein associated with anterograde membrane-bound organelles, the optic nerve fast axonal transport system was used. Using a monoclonal antibody to the 74-kD polypeptide of brain cytoplasmic dynein, the native dynein complex was immunoprecipitated from the radiolabled tissue extracts. Autoradiographs of one and two dimensional gels showed labeling of nearly all of the polypeptide isoforms of cytoplasmic dynein from rat brain. These polypeptides are phosphorylated on serine residues. Comparison of the amount of 32P incorporated into the dynein polypeptides revealed differences in the phosphorylation of dynein polypeptides from the anterograde and the cellular pools. Most interestingly, the 530-kD heavy chain of dynein appears to be phosphorylated to a lesser extent in the anterograde pool than in the cellular pool. Since the anterograde pool contains inactive dynein, while the entire cellular pool contains both inactive and active dynein, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that phosphorylation regulates the functional activity of cytoplasmic dynein.",Immunology

7528103,"Heparin-induced oligomerization of FGF molecules is responsible for FGF receptor dimerization, activation, and cell proliferation. Heparin is required for fibroblast growth factor (FGF) stimulation of biological responses. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we show that acidic FGF (aFGF) forms a 1:1 complex with the soluble extracellular domain of FGF receptor (FGFR). Heparin exerts its effect by binding to many molecules of aFGF. The resulting aFGF-heparin complex can bind to several receptor molecules, leading to FGFR dimerization. In two cell lines lacking endogenous heparan sulfate, exogenous heparin is required for FGFR dimerization, tyrosine kinase activation, c-fos mRNA transcription, and cell proliferation. Moreover, a synthetic heparin analog that binds monovalently to aFGF blocks FGFR dimerization, activation, and signaling via FGFR. We propose that heparin causes oligomerization of aFGF such that its binding to FGFR results in dimerization and activation. This represents a novel mechanism for transmembrane signaling and may account for the action of many heparin-bound growth factors.",Immunology

Pharmacological characteristics of native neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated ion currents in mouse N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells have been investigated by superfusion of voltage clamped cells with known concentrations of the agonists acetylcholine, nicotine and cytisine, and the antagonists alpha-bungarotoxin and neuronal bungarotoxin. The sensitivity of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor for agonists followed the agonist potency rank-order: nicotine approximately acetylcholine > cytisine. The EC50 values of acetylcholine and nicotine are 78 microM and 76 microM, respectively. Equal concentrations of acetylcholine and nicotine induce inward currents with approximately the same peak amplitude whereas cytisine induces much smaller inward currents. Acetylcholine-induced currents are unaffected by high concentrations of alpha-bungarotoxin. Conversely, at 10 and 90 nM neuronal bungarotoxin reduces the amplitude of the 1 mM acetylcholine-induced inward current to 47% and 11% of control values, respectively. Both the agonist potency rank-order and the differential sensitivity to snake toxins of nicotinic receptors in N1E-115 cells are consistent with the known pharmacological profile of alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes and distinct from those of all other nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of known functional subunit compositions.

The myogenic basic helix-loop-helix proteins are essential components of the regulatory network controlling vertebrate myogenesis. However, determined myoblasts appear in the limb buds which do not initially express any member of this transcription factor family. In a search for potential novel regulators of myogenesis, a human PAX-7 cDNA was isolated from primary myoblasts. Analysis of the DNA-binding properties of the Pax-7 paired domain revealed that it binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner indistinguishable from that of the paralogous Pax-3 protein. Each of the two proteins also binds to palindromic homeodomain-binding sites by cooperative dimerization. Both Pax-3 and Pax-7, which are known to partially overlap in their expression during development, can also efficiently form heterodimers on these sites and stimulate reporter gene transcription in transient transfection experiments which, in the case of Pax-7, is dependent on the transactivation function encoded by the C-terminal sequences. Thus, the formation of heterodimers might have important consequences for target gene recognition and regulation during development. PAX-7 was found to be weakly expressed in normal human myoblasts, while PAX-3 could not be detected in these cells at all. However, transcripts for either PAX-3 and/or PAX-7 were expressed at elevated levels in tumorigenic rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines.

The effects were studied of interleukin 4 (IL-4) on T cell-synovial cell adhesion and on the expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of synovial fibroblast-like cells. The adhesion of T cells toward the synovial cells were measured by 51chromium-labelled adhesion assay. The expression of adhesion molecules on synovial cells were analysed by flowcytometry. Stimulation of synovial cells with IL-4 increased T cell-synovial cells adhesion in a time- and dose-dependent manner. IL-4 considerably enhanced the expression of VCAM-1 on the surface of synovial cells, but not the expression of ICAM-1 and ELAM-1. The combination of IL-1 beta and IL-4 had no effect on the expression of ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 on the surface of synovial cells. The increased adhesion of T cells to IL-4 stimulated synovial cells was inhibited significantly by adding anti-VCAM-1 or anti-CD29 monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, anti-VLA-4 alpha or the combination of anti-VLA-4 alpha and anti-VCAM-1 antibodies blocked completely T-cell binding to IL-4 stimulated synovial cells.

7526609,"Mechanism of interferon action. Translational control and the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR): antagonists of PKR enhance the translational activity of mRNAs that include a 161 nucleotide region from reovirus S1 mRNA. The interferon-inducible, RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is an important regulator of viral protein synthesis. Activated PKR inhibits protein synthesis by phosphorylating initiation factor eIF-2 alpha. The reovirus S4 gene, whose 1196 nucleotide mRNA transcript does not activate the PKR kinase, is efficiently expressed in vector-transfected monkey COS cells. By contrast, the 1463 nucleotide S1 gene of reovirus, which is a potent activator of PKR, is poorly expressed in COS cells. Virus genetic engineering was therefore used to examine the effect of the PKR activator sequence from the reovirus S1 gene on the expression of chimeric genes of reovirus in transfected COS cells. Chimeric S1/S4 and S4/S1/S4 reovirus constructions that included the PKR activator sequence from S1 in the sigma 3 ORF of S4 were expressed much less efficiently than wild-type S4. However, expression of sigma 3 from S4 (3'UTR/S1), which included the PKR activator sequence from S1 within the 3'-UTR of S4, was comparable to that from wild-type S4. Treatment of COS cells with 2-aminopurine, an inhibitor of PKR, increased the expression of the reovirus S1, S1/S4, and S4/S1/S4 chimeric genes but not the S4 gene or S4 (3'UTR/S1) chimera in transfected COS cells. Likewise, coexpression of the phosphotransfer-negative mutant PKR (K296R) increased the expression of reovirus S1, S1/S4 and S4/S1/S4 chimeric genes but not the S4 gene or S4 (3'UTR/S1) chimera in cotransfected COS cells. Truncated PKR(1-243) which includes the dsRNA binding domain but not the kinase catalytic subdomains was able to enhance the expression of reovirus S1, but did not affect S4 expression. The dsRNA binding protein E3L encoded by vaccinia virus also increased S1 expression similar to PKR (1-243) and PKR(K296R). These results suggest that the translational repression in vivo mediated by PKR is selective for mRNAs that possess the kinase activator region, and that the dominant negative effect of PKR on gene expression is likely mediated by the RNA binding activity of the PKR protein.",Immunology

Fidelity of the amplified sequence was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion and Southern blot hybridization. The level of Topo-I mRNA was correlated positively with the cytotoxicity of a Topo-I inhibitor, a camptothecin derivative. This RT-PCR method may be applicable to the assessment of sensitivity of cells to Topo-I targeted drugs, especially when only small quantities of cell samples are available.",Immunology
7523072,"Kinetics of bioconcentration and clearance of 28 polychlorinated biphenyl congeners in zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio). Bioconcentration experiments were performed on 28 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners with NCl = 2 to NCl = 10, evaluating them simultaneously. Bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were calculated from the uptake rate constant (k1) and the clearance rate constant (k2) as BCF = k1/k2. BCFs on a wet weight basis ranged from 7710 to 940,000. They were correlated with octanol-water partition coefficients (P). The curvilinear relationship between log BCF and log P based upon data covering the log P range 5.06 to 8.18. About a log P of 7.38, a range of ""optimal lipophilicity,"" results in highest BCFs for PCBs, above which the degree of bioconcentration decreases.",Immunology
7521476,"Chronic versus acute effects of amiodarone on the Vmax-conduction velocity relationship and on the space constant in canine myocardium. Isolated tissue experiments (canine ventricular epicardium) and computer simulations were used to characterize the relationship between changes in maximum rate of depolarization during upstroke (Vmax) and the conduction velocity (theta) induced after long-term therapy with amiodarone and to compare these data with those obtained after acute superfusion with either desethylamiodarone or the parent compound. After chronic amiodarone, the changes in Vmax were linearly related to the square of the changes in theta during longitudinal propagation (LP) (slope = 0.93, r = 0.93, p = NS with respect to slope = 1), whereas during transverse propagation (TP), the slope of the relationship between both variables was slightly decreased (slope = 0.88, r = 0.96, p < 0.05 with respect to slope = 1). Similar results were observed after acute superfusion with desethylamiodarone (LP), (slope = 1, r = 0.05, p = NS with respect to slope = 1). In contrast, a significant increase in slope (p < 0.05 with respect to slope = 1) was observed after acute superfusion (slope = 1.45, r = 0.85 and slope = 1.48, r = 0.75 during LP and TP, respectively). In addition, the space constant (lambda) after chronic amiodarone (1.05 +/- 0.06 mm) was not significantly different from control (0.98 +/- 0.04 mm), but was slightly though significantly increased after acute amiodarone administration (1.07 +/- 0.03 mm, p < 0.03). Data are mean +/- SEM. Experimental data from chronic amiodarone were well fitted in a one-dimensional Beeler-Reuter-based discrete cable by reducing sodium conductance (GNa) exclusively. In contrast, data from acute superfusion were fitted only when junctional resistance (rj) and GNa were simultaneously reduced. These data suggest that acute amiodarone may modify both active and passive membrane properties whereas chronic amiodarone appears to alter only the active properties; the data further indicate that desethylamiodarone may play an important role in the mechanism of action of chronic amiodarone treatment.",Immunology
7520983,"The spermatid micronucleus test with the dissection technique detects the germ cell mutagenicity of acrylamide in rat meiotic cells. As a part of the development and validation of the spermatid micronucleus test (SMNT) in the project 'Detection of Germ Cell Mutagens' sponsored by the CEC we studied the mutagenicity of acrylamide (AA) and mitomycin C (MMC). Of two alternative techniques, we used the 'dissection technique' based on microdissection of seminiferous tubules offering a narrow window for evaluation of cell stage sensitivity, and including DNA-specific staining and scoring. AA given as a single injection of 50 or 100 mg/kg did not significantly increase MN frequencies. When a subchronic treatment (4 x 50 mg/kg) was given, a significant increase over background was observed 18 and 19 days after the last injection, indicating genotoxic activity in preleptotene spermatocytes and late spermatogonial stages. MMC given as single injections of 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg increased MN frequencies significantly 17, 18, 19 and 20 days after treatment as a result of clastogenicity in S phase cells. DNA flow cytometry did not show cytotoxicity of AA to preleptotene spermatocytes, but a small decrease in the numbers of stem cells. If spindle disturbances are caused by AA, as suggested, they were not detectable by induction of spermatid MN in vivo 1 or 3 days after treatment or by treatment with AA of cultured segments of seminiferous tubules undergoing meiotic divisions in vitro. In conclusion, the SMNT with the dissection technique is able to show the germ cell clastogenicity of AA and MMC. AA was observed to have a much weaker MN inducing potency than MMC.",Immunology
7519951,"Epinephrine-induced ventricular premature complexes due to early afterdepolarizations and effects of verapamil and propranolol in a patient with congenital long QT syndrome. We report a patient with congenital long QT syndrome in whom early afterdepolarizations (EADs) were demonstrated on monophasic action potential (MAP) recordings in the left ventricular mid-base inferior wall. Epinephrine infusion at 5 micrograms/min increased the amplitude of the EADs and the late component of the T(U) wave. Epinephrine also induced ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) with right bundle branch block morphology and left-axis deviation that occurred from the peak of the EADs. Verapamil injection (5 mg) during continuous epinephrine infusion abolished all VPCs with a slight reduction in the amplitude of the EADs. Propranolol injection (5 mg) in addition to verapamil further reduced the amplitude of the EADs and the late component of the T(U) wave. These findings suggest that the epinephrine-induced VPCs were closely related to triggered rhythm arising from the EADs, and that both verapamil and propranolol were effective for the suppression of VPCs and EADs.",Immunology
7518601,"Functional effects of a family of galanin antagonists on the cardiovascular system in anaesthetised cats. Previous studies have shown that injection of galanin (GAL: 6.2 nmol/kg) causes prolonged inhibition of cardiac vagal action in anaesthetised cats. Stimulation of the cardiac sympathetic nerve (16 Hz for 5 min) also produces inhibition of cardiac vagal action, an effect which has been proposed to be due to the release of endogenous GAL from sympathetic nerves. In a previous study we tested galantide (M15) and in this study we compared galantide with two other GAL antagonists for their GAL antagonist activity in our experimental model. Each of these incorporate the N-terminal fragment GAL 1-13 and a C-terminal portion of another bioactive peptide and all are C-terminally amidated. GAL 1-13 Substance P 5-11 amide (galantide: M15: 62 nmol/kg and 156 nmol/kg), GAL 1-13 Spantide amide (C7: 156 nmol/kg) and GAL 1-13 NPY 24-36 amide (M32a: 62 nmol/kg) all significantly reduced the cardiac vagal inhibitory effect of exogenous GAL and also reduced the effect of sympathetic stimulation on subsequent cardiac vagal slowing, giving strong support to our hypothesis that GAL is involved in this phenomenon. No antagonist reduced the depressor effect of GAL. This study demonstrates the GAL antagonist properties of these agents on autonomic neuroeffector functions making them useful tools in elucidating further functions of endogenous GAL.",Immunology

This retrospective study evaluated the outcome for a cohort of men undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy alone as primary treatment for clinical T1-2 prostate adenocarcinoma. Sixty-two patients treated at Boston University Medical Center between 1987 and 1992 underwent radical prostatectomy alone without adjuvant or neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. Actuarial and multivariate analyses were made of disease-free outcome according to preoperative tumor T stage, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and biopsy grade, and according to the pathologic findings at surgery. Recurrence was defined as the persistence or recurrence of detectable serum PSA four or more weeks following surgery. Of all patients judged clinically to have localized disease (T1-2), 52 percent proved to have pathologic T3 tumors. Of these, 81 percent had positive surgical margins. The strongest preoperative predictors of pT3 disease were the biopsy Gleason grade and the initial serum PSA value. Actuarial analysis showed the overall likelihood of remaining free from detectable PSA at four years to be 43 percent (75% for those with organ-confined disease and 27% for those who were pT3). The poorest prognosis was seen in those with seminal vesicle involvement. Biopsy Gleason grade and initial PSA were independent preoperative predictors of biochemical failure in a Cox regression analysis but clinical T stage was not. The biopsy Gleason grade and initial PSA were identified as strong preoperative predictors of disease-free outcome. We confirmed the favorable prognosis of men with organ-confined disease, but emphasize the high likelihood of relapse in those with positive surgical margins or seminal vesicle invasion.",Immunology
7514106,"Expression of the zeta protein subunit in CD3- NK effectors derived from human thymus. The origin, lineage derivation, and sites of human natural killer (NK) cell differentiation are presently unresolved. The vast majority of NK cells found in peripheral blood have surface membrane expression of CD2 and CD16. Both antigens trigger activation pathways which require the zeta protein, a signal-transducing subunit of the CD3-T cell receptor (CD3-TCR) complex which is found as an isolated homodimer (zeta-zeta) or heterodimer (zeta-Fc epsilon RI gamma) in human NK cells. Unlike NK cells found in adult peripheral blood, NK cells derived in vitro from human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells lack CD2 and CD16, and those found in fetal liver constitutively express CD3 epsilon and delta proteins. However, NK effectors derived in vitro from immature human CD3- thymocytes show striking phenotypic and functional similarities to adult human NK cells. In this report, we characterize zeta protein expression in CD3- thymocytes following short-term culture in recombinant (r)IL-2. CD3-CD56+ thymocyte NK effectors express the zeta protein as a disulphide-linked homodimer of 32 kDa, yet lack other protein components of the CD3-TCR complex. Both CD16+ and CD16- populations were found to express zeta, and within the CD16+ fraction, zeta is physically associated with CD16. These data provide evidence of additional similarities between adult peripheral blood NK cells and CD3-CD56+ NK effectors derived from human thymocytes, and suggest that under these experimental conditions, human NK cells can arise from early thymic precursors.",Immunology

7514033,"Stromal expression of tenascin is inversely correlated to epithelial differentiation of hormone dependent tissues. We were previously investigating the expression of the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin in normal and malignant endometrial tissues of humans and rodents. These studies suggested that the expression of tenascin was induced by proliferating epithelia (normal and particularly malignant) and was downregulated with their differentiation. The aim of this study was to investigate the hormone dependency of tenascin expression in (a) the transplantable EnDA endometrial tumor model with or without estrogen deprivation (ovariectomy) of the animals, (b) DMBA-induced rat mammary tumors with or without a hormonal treatment of the animals [ovariectomy, antiestrogen (tamoxifen) or antiprogestin (ZK 98299) treatment] and (c) in the rat prostate of untreated or androgen deprived animals (orchiectomy, flutamide-, casodex- or cyproterone acetate (CPA)-treatment). 1. Estrogen withdrawal by ovariectomy did not affect tenascin expression in transplantable EnDA endometrial adenocarcinoma, meaning the entire extracellular space of the stromal mesenchyme was decorated by tenascin immunoreactivity. 2. In untreated DMBA-induced rat mammary tumors almost the entire extracellular space of the stroma was stained by tenascin immunoreactivity. Ovariectomy and antiestrogen treatment did not affect tenascin expression. In contrast, antiprogestin treatment induced terminal differentiation of mammary tumor cells and in parallel downregulated tenascin expression. 3. In the normal rat prostate no tenascin was detectable by immunocytochemistry. However, following androgen deprivation we found tenascin expression in the stroma of the prostate. The most prominent expression was observable after CPA-treatment, possibly due to its progestagenic potency. In conclusion, the hormones and antihormones tested show no direct effect on the stromal expression of tenascin. However, proliferative activity and a low degree of differentiation of the epithelium induces tenascin expression, whereas epithelial differentiation apparently shuts down tenascin expression. Preliminary in vitro studies suggest that paracrine acting growth factors trigger the hormonal regulation of tenascin expression.",Immunology
7514029,"Prostatic carcinoma: a multivariate analysis of prognostic factors. Tissue specimens from 150 patients with localised prostatic carcinomas and 116 patients with prostatic carcinomas with distant metastases were analysed for histological grade (WHO and Gleason) and immunoreactivity for prostate acid phosphatase (PAP), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), neurone-specific enolase (NSE), p53 protein, c-erbB-2 protein, cytokeratins (AE1/AE3) and vimentin. After stratification for the presence or absence of distant metastases, multivariate regression analysis revealed that WHO grading was the most powerful independent prognosticator, followed by age and prostate acid phosphatase expression. There was a trend towards reduced survival with decreasing prostate-specific antigen reactivity. The Gleason system showed poor prognostic ability. The analysis predicted reduced survival in the presence of extensive neurone-specific enolase reactivity, mostly because of one case of small-cell carcinoma.",Immunology
7514001,"Receptor-receptor interactions as an integrative mechanism in nerve cells. Several lines of evidence indicate that interactions among transmission lines can take place at the level of the cell membrane via interactions among macromolecules, integral or associated to the cell membrane, involved in signal recognition and transduction. The present view will focus on this last subject, i.e., on the interactions between receptors for chemical signals at the level of the neuronal membrane (receptor-receptor interaction). By receptor-receptor interaction we mean that a neurotransmitter or modulator, by binding to its receptor, modifies the characteristics of the receptor for another transmitter or modulator. Four types of interactions among transmission lines may be considered, but mainly intramembrane receptor-receptor interactions have been dealt with in this article, exemplified by the heteroregulation of D2 receptors via neuropeptide receptors and A2 receptors. The role of receptor-receptor interactions in the integration of signals is discussed, especially in terms of filtration of incoming signals, of integration of coincident signals, and of neuronal plasticity.",Immunology

The present study examined histological changes induced by catheter guided radiofrequency current in a patient with AV nodal reentrant tachycardia who underwent cardiac transplantation 1 week after ablation of the slow pathway. During the electrophysiology study AV nodal conduction curves were discontinuous and AV nodal reentry was induced. At the conclusion of the procedure there was no evidence of slow pathway function. Histological sections from the explanted heart demonstrated a sharply demarcated atrial lesion (5 x 5 x 4 mm) extending from the septal portion of the tricuspid annulus to the posterior border of the AV node. The lesion did not encompass the compact AV node. These observations support the hypothesis that the slow pathway is comprised of atrial approaches to the AV node and is distinct from the compact AV node.,Immunology
7513398,"Effect of low dose aspirin on augmented plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 activity in patients with permanent pacemakers. To clarify the activity states of coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with a permanent pacemaker, we studied 29 patients more than 4 months after operation. They were divided into a single pacemaker lead group (S, n = 14) and a double lead group (D, n = 15). Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, antithrombin III, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) activity, and platelet aggregation were measured and compared to those in an age-matched control group (C, n = 7). The effects of low dose aspirin (81 mg/day) in the patients (n = 21) were also studied 2 weeks after administration. PAI-1 activity in groups S and D was significantly higher than that in the group C (53.5 +/- 36.5, 86.8 +/- 59.2 ng/mL vs 19.4 +/- 7.2 ng/mL; P < 0.01 and P < 0.005). Platelet aggregation induced by collagen was slightly higher in groups S and D than group C. Other parameters were not significantly different. In the patients, low dose aspirin significantly suppressed collagen induced platelet aggregation (71.8 +/- 20.3% vs 41.7 +/- 28.3%; P < 0.005), but not PAI-1 activity. tPA activity was increased significantly by the low dose aspirin administration (3.94 +/- 1.85 ng/mL vs 2.48 +/- 1.19 ng/mL; P < 0.005). Thus, PAI-1 activity in patients with a permanent pacemaker is elevated, and the activity is not suppressed by low dose aspirin unlike the platelet aggregation.",Immunology

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to amplify cDNAs constructed from the poly(A)+RNA of venom glands in Taiwan cobras to facilitate the cloning and sequencing of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) gene. The PCR product was then subcloned into pUC18 vector and transformed in E. coli strain JM109. Plasmids purified from the positive clones were prepared for nucleotide sequencing by dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method. Sequencing several clones containing about 0.5 kb DNA inserts constructed a complete and unambiguous full-length reading frame of 468 base pairs covering a precursor for phospholipase A2 with a deduced mature protein sequence of 119 amino acids and a 27 amino-acid segment of signal peptide. The sequenced major PLA2 with pI 4.991 shows a high degree of sequence homology to those PLA2 of the same or closely-related genus. The deduced protein sequence allows us to correct and resolve some discrepancy between the sequences determined by conventional protein sequencing (Toxicon, 19, 141(1981)) and X-ray crystallography (Science, 250, 1560(1990)). Expression of PLA2 in E. coli vector generated a polypeptide which can cross-react with the antiserum against the native and purified PLA2 from the same cobra venom albeit with a much lower activity.",Immunology

7510695,"Pyridine nucleotide redox potential modulates cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl- conductance. Cl- conductance of the apical membrane of airway epithelial cells has properties of a passive diffusion mechanism but is decreased by inhibition of oxidative metabolism. Recent reports that cAMP-dependent Cl- conductance also requires ATP at the intracellular domains of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) suggests that ATP concentration could mediate metabolic regulation of Cl- conductance. However, metabolic inhibitors affect processes other than ATP free energy levels, including notably the metabolic pathways that set the redox potential of pyridine nucleotides within the cell. We have investigated the possibility that CFTR-mediated Cl- conductance is affected by the ratio of oxidized to reduced intracellular pyridine nucleotides. CFTR was expressed in airway and heterologous cells and studied under whole cell voltage clamp conditions, which permitted the intracellular NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H ratio to be varied independently of ATP concentration. In three cell types expressing CFTR, whole cell dialysis with reduced pyridine nucleotides inhibited activation of Cl- currents by forskolin and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (CPT-cAMP), whereas dialysis with oxidized pyridines increased both basal and stimulated CFTR-mediated Cl- conductance. In cell-attached membrane patches, the open probability of 5-6-picosiemens Cl- channels that had been activated by forskolin and CPT-cAMP was further and reversibly increased by permeant oxidants. Neither swelling-induced whole cell K+ currents in CFTR-expressing cells nor swelling-induced whole cell Cl- currents in multidrug resistance protein-expressing cells were affected by NADPH. Pyridine nucleotide redox potential had little effect on phosphorylation of histone by protein kinase A. We conclude that CFTR Cl- conductance function can be modulated by pyridine nucleotide redox potential. This effect points to the existence of a mechanism or mechanisms by which cytosolic nucleotides other than ATP can affect plasma membrane Cl- conductance and may help explain how a passive ion conductance is linked to cellular energy metabolism.",Immunology

7508993,"Nucleocapsid-glycoprotein interactions required for assembly of alphaviruses. We have studied interactions between nucleocapsids and glycoproteins required for budding of alphaviruses, using Ross River virus-Sindbis virus chimeras in which the nucleocapsid protein is derived from one virus and the envelope glycoproteins are derived from the second virus. A virus containing the Ross River virus genome in which the capsid protein had been replaced with that from Sindbis virus was almost nonviable. Nucleocapsids formed in normal numbers in the infected cell, but very little virus was released from the cell. There are 11 amino acid differences between Ross River virus and Sindbis virus in their 33-residue E2 cytoplasmic domains. Site-specific mutagenesis was used to change 9 of these 11 amino acids in the chimera from the Ross River virus to the Sindbis virus sequence in an attempt to adapt the E2 of the chimera to the nucleocapsid. The resulting mutant chimera grew 4 orders of magnitude better than the parental chimeric virus. This finding provides direct evidence for a sequence-specific interaction between the nucleocapsid and the E2 cytoplasmic domain during virus budding. The mutated chimeric virus readily gave rise to large-plaque variants that grew almost as well as Ross River virus, suggesting that additional single amino acid substitutions in the structural proteins can further enhance the interactions between the disparate capsid and the glycoproteins. Unexpectedly, change of E2 residue 394 from lysine (Ross River virus) to glutamic acid (Sindbis virus) was deleterious for the chimera, suggesting that in addition to its role in nucleocapsid-E2 interactions, the N-terminal part of the E2 cytoplasmic domain may be involved in glycoprotein-glycoprotein interactions required to assemble the glycoprotein spikes. The reciprocal chimera, Sindbis virus containing the Ross River virus capsid, also grew poorly. Suppressor mutations arose readily in this chimera, producing a virus that grew moderately well and that formed larger plaques.",Immunology

The biologic activities of retinoic acid and 3,4-didehydroretinoic acid, two endogenous vitamin A derivatives in various tissues, were compared to their affinities for the nuclear retinoic acid receptors and their ability to induce transcriptional activation. Both retinoids were equipotent inducers of differentiation of F9 teratocarcinoma cells. In a morphologic assay, using reconstructed skin, retinoic acid and 3,4-didehydroretinoic acid inhibited keratinization at a concentration of 100 nM. In cultured keratinocytes, a 50% inhibition of the production of the keratinocyte transglutaminase enzyme was achieved with about 20 nM for both retinoids. The in vitro binding to the nuclear retinoic acid receptors alpha, beta, and gamma showed that retinoic acid and 3,4-didehydroretinoic acid had almost equal affinities for the receptors with Kds ranging from 3 to 47 nM. The transcriptional activation resulting from the addition of the two retinoids to cells co-transfected with alpha, beta, or gamma retinoic acid receptor expression vectors and a retinoic acid responsive element linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene was similar. Finally, it was demonstrated that retinoic acid did not metabolize to 3,4-didehydroretinoic acid, and a slow conversion of 3,4-didehydroretinoic acid into retinoic acid was not sufficient to explain the biologic effects produced by the former compound. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that retinoic acid and 3,4-didehydroretinoic acid have the same activity in several different test systems, but their metabolism differs depending on the cell type used.",Immunology

Five monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), 77, 114, 138, 175 and 187, were established for rat cystatin A. MAbs 77, 114, 138 and 175 were shown to belong to the IgG1 subclass, whereas MAb 187 was an IgM. These MAbs partially suppressed inhibitory activity of rat cystatin A to papain. Their epitopes were mapped in detail on the molecule by examining the reactivities of the MAbs with NH2-terminally truncated forms and fragments of rat cystatin A by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and by reactivity with the inhibitor on immunoblotting. In competitive binding assays the MAbs did not compete with each other, indicating that the epitopes recognized by these MAbs were substantially different. The conformational epitope recognized by the three MAbs 114, 138 and 175 belonged to one group that was highly sensitive to denaturation, but those epitopes were unchanged by NH2-terminal truncation. MAb 187 was able to recognize a linear epitope present in amino acid residues 15-50 in the NH2-terminal region. MAbs 77 and 114 reacted weakly with mouse cystatin A but not at all with human cystatin A, whereas MAb 187 reacted similarly with mouse cystatin A but at about half that level with human. The MAbs produced in this study should be useful tools for detecting conformational changes in the rat cystatin A molecule.",Immunology

7507015,"Immunopathological features of palatine tonsil characteristic of IgA nephropathy: IgA1 localization in follicular dendritic cells. IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is generally thought to be mediated by the glomerular deposition of circulating immune complexes containing IgA as the major antibody component. Upper respiratory infections and tonsillitis often precede IgAN, and in some cases tonsillectomy is effective for the treatment of IgAN. Thus, the tonsil seems to be a unique organ causing initial and/or progressive events to generate nephritogenic immune complexes in IgAN. In this study we focused on the analysis of immunopathological features of the palatine tonsil characteristic of IgAN patients by using an immunohistochemical technique. The IgA1 subclass was demonstrated in follicular dendritic cells (FDC) of the tonsil of IgAN patients, but not in FDC of non-IgAN controls. On the other hand, IgA2, IgG, IgM and C3 did not show any differences in distribution between the two groups. Moreover, the expression of decay-accelerating factor (DAF), an inhibitor of homologous complement activation, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), an inducer of antibody-producing cells to IgA class switching, in FDC and interdigitating dendritic cells of the tonsil, respectively, which was also clarified in this study for the first time, was found to be identically distributed in the two groups. These findings may support the idea that IgA1, possibly in an immune complex form, is trapped by FDC and plays an important role in the persistent activation of particular B cell repertoires responsible for the onset and/or progression of IgAN.",Immunology

(2) the polyethylene abrasions caused by Al2O3 ceramic heads is far less than metal heads, but its ability to adapt geometrically is limited due to its being less strong. The abrasions appear because of geometric differences in the prosthetic joint, local problems in the surface architecture and physical/chemical interactions between the different materials. In this study we compare the new ""Titan-Niob Ceramic Multilayer Sandwich Head"" (built three layers of microsegregation phases and three in-between layers of ultrathin metal, 8-10 microns thick, and a surface with integrated grease holes) with the common CoCrMo heads and Al2O3 ceramic heads. Testing 2,000,000 cycles in a bodylike liquid under permanent loads of 90 kPa, periodically increasing up to 250 kPa, simulating normal stress situations (i.e., walking), the ""Titan-Niob Ceramic Multilayer Sandwich Head"" showed major advantages over the metal heads and also over the ceramic heads even though the ceramic head has been accepted so far to have the best friction coefficient. Furthermore, there has been no problem in surface fracture with the ""Titan-Niob Ceramic Multilayer Sandwich Head"".",Immunology

Inflammatory cells entering the anterior chamber of the eye in response to viral infection underwent apoptosis that was dependent on Fas (CD95)-Fas ligand (FasL) and produced no tissue damage. In contrast, viral infection in gld mice, which lack functional FasL, resulted in an inflammation and invasion of ocular tissue without apoptosis. Fas-positive but not Fas-negative tumor cells were killed by apoptosis when placed within isolated anterior segments of the eyes of normal but not FasL-negative mice. FasL messenger RNA and protein were detectable in the eye. Thus, Fas-FasL interactions appear to be an important mechanism for the maintenance of immune privilege.",Immunology

Site-directed mutagenesis of the acidic clusters 207Asp-Asp-Asp209 and 213Glu-Glu-Asp215 of NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase demonstrates that both cytochrome c and cytochrome P450 interact with this region; however, the sites and mechanisms of interaction of the two substrates are clearly distinct. Substitutions in the first acidic cluster did not affect cytochrome c or ferricyanide reductase activity, but substitution of asparagine for aspartate at position 208 reduced cytochrome P450-dependent benzphetamine N-demethylase activity by 63% with no effect on KP450m or KNADPHm. Substitutions in the second acidic cluster affected cytochrome c reduction but not benzphetamine N-demethylase or ferricyanide reductase activity. The E213Q enzyme exhibited a 59% reduction in cytochrome c reductase activity and a 47% reduction in KCyt cm under standard conditions (x0.27 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.7), as well as a decreased KCyt cm at every ionic strength and a shift of the salt dependence of cytochrome c reductase activity toward lower ionic strengths. The E214Q substitution did not affect cytochrome c reductase activity under standard conditions, but shifted the salt dependence of cytochrome c reductase activity toward higher ionic strengths. Measurements of the effect of ionic strength on steady-state kinetic properties indicated that increasing ionic strength destabilized the reductase-cytochrome c3+ ground state and reductase-cytochrome c transition state complexes for the wild-type, E213Q, and E214Q enzymes, suggesting the presence of electrostatic interactions involving Glu213 and Glu214 as well as additional residues outside this region. The ionic strength dependence of kcat/KCyt cm for the wild-type and E214Q enzymes is consistent with the presence of charge-pairing interactions in the transition state and removal of a weak ionic interaction in the reductase-cytochrome c transition-state complex by the E214Q substitution. The ionic strength dependence of the E213Q enzyme, however, is not consistent with a simple electrostatic model. Effects of ionic strength on kinetic properties of E213Q suggest that substitution of glutamine stabilizes the reductase-cytochrome c3+ ground-state complex, leading to a net increase in activation energy and decrease in kcat. Glu213 is also involved in a repulsive interaction with cytochrome c3+. Cytochrome c2+ Ki for the wild-type enzyme was 82.4 microM at 118 mM ionic strength and 10.8 microM at 749 mM ionic strength; similar values were observed for the E214Q enzyme. Cytochrome c Ki for the E213Q enzyme was 17.6 microM at 118 mM and 15.7 microM at 749 mM ionic strength, consistent with removal of an electrostatic repulsion between the reductase and cytochrome c2+.",Immunology

Identification of appropriate strategies for controlling gastro-intestinal nematodes in communities depends, in part, on an understanding of the conditions that increase risk of exposure to infective stages. The present study was conducted in Lubumbashi, Zaire. The objectives were to identify features of the environment and living conditions that were significant predictors of Ascaris lumbricoides infection, and to determine whether the same predictors were important in populations living in subdivisions of lower (LSES) and higher (HSES) socio-economic status. Forty-two households from each of three subdivisions (two LSES and one HSES) were selected at random. Mothers were interviewed, observations on the environment around the home were recorded, and single stool samples, collected from all children and mothers, were examined for nematode eggs. Maternal education was a significant predictor of A. lumbricoides intensity in both LSES and HSES subdivisions. Factors related to poor sanitation (open defecation and high number of people using the same toilet) were important in the LSES subdivisions but not in the HSES subdivision. In contrast, the ratio of relatives to direct family members per household was a significant predictor of high intensity of infection in the HSES subdivision, but not in the LSES subdivisions, indicating that relatives and live-in visitors contribute to Ascaris transmission in the HSES population.",Immunology

In 1994, 48 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico reported 8,224 cases of rabies in nonhuman animals and 6 cases in human beings to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 93% (7,632 cases) were wild animals, whereas 7% (592 cases) were domestic species. The total number of reported cases decreased 13.4% from that of 1993 (9,498 cases), with most of the decline resulting from 19.2% fewer cases of rabies in raccoons. Two previously described epizootics of rabies involving the raccoon variant of the rabies virus have converged in North Carolina, and the resulting region is now continuous from Alabama and Florida in the South to Maine in the North. Epizootics of rabies in foxes in west central Texas and in dogs and coyotes in southern Texas continue to expand, with this state reporting 144 rabid foxes, 53 rabid dogs, and 77 of the 85 cases in coyotes during 1994. Maine and New Hampshire reported cases of rabies in foxes (6 and 9, respectively) for the first time in 10 years. Nationally, reported cases of rabies in dogs (153) increased by 17.7%, whereas cases in cattle (111) and cats (267) decreased by 14.6 and 8.3%, respectively.

Each of the annexins was present in synovial tissues in significant amounts in the three groups studied. Annexin-I was predominantly found within the synovial lining layer and double labelling showed it to be present predominantly in cells of the macrophage lineage. In rheumatoid specimens there was increased staining within the lining layer, perivascularly and on macrophages within the tissue stroma. Annexin-II was present in a distribution similar to that of annexin-I, but with more prominent perivascular staining. Annexins-IV and -VI were seen chiefly in association with areas of lymphocyte infiltration in rheumatoid tissue, whereas annexins-I and -II were absent from these areas. Endothelial cells stained weakly positive for annexins-I and -II, and more strongly for -IV and -VI.

One of the suggested contributory factors to the development of dermal fibrosis is a decrease in collagenase activity, which may be related to levels of serum tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1). The aim of this study was to determine the clinical significance of serum TIMP-1 levels in systemic sclerosis (SSc). We measured serum TIMP-1 concentration in 62 patients with SSc, 11 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, 14 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and 22 members of a normal control group. The clinical features of the patients with SSc and elevated TIMP levels were examined. The mean TIMP-1 level in the patients with SSc was significantly higher than that in the members of the control group or the patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. In 44% of the patients with SSc the serum TIMP-1 level was elevated. The mean serum TIMP-1 level in patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc (dSSc) was significantly higher than that in those with limited cutaneous SSc. The patients with dSSc and elevated serum TIMP-1 levels showed a significantly greater incidence of lung fibrosis and anti-topoisomerase I antibody than those with normal serum TIMP-1 levels. The TIMP-1 level and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide in the patients with SSc were negatively correlated. Increased mitogenic activity on dermal fibroblasts caused by serum from patients with dSSc was partially blocked by anti-TIMP-1 IgG. These findings suggest that serum TIMP-1 level is a useful indicator of disease activity in patients with SSc and that TIMP is involved in the pathogenesis of SSc.",Immunology

Over a period of six years, five seriously ill infants were referred with complications arising from ritual circumcision performed by nonphysicians. Four infants developed systemic infections; in three of them, including one with early meningitis, there was septicemia. The common predisposing factor was an excessively tight dressing over an infected penile wound, leading to urinary retention, urinary tract infection and septicemia. In the fifth infant, the glans had been partially amputated and required a suture; a second dressing tightly applied to control the bleeding was removed without subsequent problems. To prevent the above complications, careful attention should be paid to the baby's voiding within the first 6 to 8 h after circumcision. In addition, it is suggested that all dressings should be removed, or at least replaced, on the day following circumcision, when the likelihood or primary hemorrhage has passed.

Exposure of human neutrophils to concanavalin A (Con A) resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent extracellular release of granule-associated lysozyme but not beta-glucuronidase or cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase. Maximum extrusion of lysozyme occurred 30 min after cell contact with Con A. The percent of total granule enzyme activity discharged is insignificant when cells are not preincubated with cytochalasin B prior to being exposed to Con A (5-50 micrograms/ml). Granule enzyme release from Con A-treated cells is markedly inhibited by alpha-methyl-D-mannoside. Con A-elicited extrusion of lysozyme is reduced significantly, but not abolished, in the absence of extracellular calcium. However, contact between neutrophils and EGTA in calcium-free medium had no effect on Con A-stimulated release of granule enzymes. 8-(N,N-diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride (TMB-8), an antagonist of intracellular calcium, caused a dose-dependent inhibition of lysozyme discharge from Con A-treated neutrophils.

Observations were made in hydropenia (C) and during sustained isotonic saline volume expansion (E; 3% increase in body weight). The intrarenal venous pressure (IRVP) was used as an index of peritubular capillary hydrostatic pressure, and the efferent arteriolar colloid osmotic pressure (COPeff) was estimated from the arterial COP and the filtration fraction. C values (mean +/- SEM) in HT (and NT) were: arterial pressure (MAP) 110 +/- 3 mm Hg (85 +/- 1, p  less than 0.001); glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 122 +/- 4 ml/min/1.73 m2 (128 +/- 3, p greater than 0.05); renal blood flow (RBF) 1172 +/- 38 ml/min/1.73 m2 (1298 +/- 48, p less than 0.05); IRVP 25.0 +/- 1.0 mm Hg (24.8 +/- 0.8, p greater than 0.05); COPeff 33.0 +/- 0.7 mm Hg (31.9 +/- 0.6, p greater than 0.05); and UNaV 140 +/- 13 mumole/min (161 +/- 12, p greater than 0.05).

Biogenesis of the mitochondrial matrix enzyme, ornithine transcarbamylase, has been shown to begin with synthesis on cytoplasmic ribosomes of a precursor, designated pre-ornithine transcarbamylase, which is approximately 4000 daltons larger than its corresponding mitochondrial subunit, followed by post-translational uptake and proteolytic processing of the precursor to its mature counterpart by mitochondria. We now report initial studies on the structure and properties of preornithine transcarbamylase. When this precursor is labeled at the NH2 terminus with N-formyl[35S]methionine and processed by mitochondria, no label is recovered with the mature subunit. This demonstrates that the amino acid extension which is characteristic of the precursor and which is removed during mitochondrial processing is NH2-terminal. This NH2-terminal extension is found intact in two peptides produced by limited proteolysis of the labeled precursor. Moreover, this amino acid extension modifies the behavior of the precursor during immunoprecipitation in the presence of ionic detergents and plays a critical role in facilitating uptake of the precursor by mitochondria.",Immunology

In the presence of 0.1-10 mM Sr2+, the activation phase of I(f) was followed by a slower decay during hyperpolarization. In the steady state I/V diagram, the Sr2+ block progressed with increasing hyperpolarization. Ba2+ also blocked I(f), but no time dependency could be observed. The blocking effect of Ca2+ was weak, and Mg2+ had little effect on I(f). The relationship between extracellular Sr2+ concentration [Sr2+]o and the block was described by a Hill coefficient of 1. The half-saturating [Sr2+]o were 2.0, 1.6, 1.1 and 0.65 mM at -90, -100, -110 and -120 mV, respectively. The rapid application of Sr2+ during the full activation of I(f) using the jet-stream method induced an exponential decline of I(f). The reciprocal time constants were linearly correlated to [Sr2+]o, suggesting 1:1 binding stoichiometry. The fractional electrical distance for the binding site was approximately 0.5 from the external side of the channel. Based on the multiple closed and open states for the I(f) channel, a mathematical model for the Sr2+ block was constructed in which the time course of I(f) in the presence of Sr2+ was described by the sum of three exponential functions.

Retinal ischemia induces intraocular neovascularization, which often leads to glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal detachment, presumably by stimulating the release of angiogenic molecules. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an endothelial-cell-specific angiogenic factor whose production is increased by hypoxia. We measured the concentration of VEGF in 210 specimens of ocular fluid obtained from 164 patients undergoing intraocular surgery, using both radioimmuno-assays and radioreceptor assays. Vitreous proliferative potential was measured with in vitro assays of the growth of retinal endothelial cells and with VEGF-neutralizing antibody.

VEGF stimulated the growth of retinal endothelial cells in vitro, as did vitreous fluid containing measurable VEGF. Stimulation was inhibited by VEGF-neutralizing antibodies.

The understanding of recognition events that underlie the migration of antigen-specific T cells to a target organ during immune-mediated damage will be integral to the therapy of a number of human conditions of proven or suspected autoimmune etiology. In experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), the laboratory model of the human demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis, previous studies have concentrated on susceptible strains and have shown that myelin-specific T cells play an early, key role in central nervous system (CNS), lesion formation. Not known in this model is whether in EAE-resistant strains, similar antigen-specific T cells possess the ability to recognize CNS endothelium and infiltrate the CNS. Myelin basic protein (MBP)-responsive T cells derived from mice of the C57BL/6 strain (bearing the Thy-1.2 allele) were adoptively transferred to the Thy-1.1 congenic strain C57BL/Ka. Some recipients were given a subsequent challenge with MBP in adjuvant, a protocol recently shown to break resistance in this strain and cause EAE. On the basis of the difference in Thy-1 allele, T cell trafficking was followed in this EAE-resistant congenic strain following the different sensitization protocols. In C57BL/Ka mice receiving adoptively transferred C57BL/6 cells followed by MBP challenge, donor MBP-responsive Thy-1.2+ lymphocytes were detected by immunocytochemistry in the Thy-1.1 host CNS and also in peripheral lymphoid organs. In mice given MBP-sensitized cells without additional antigen challenge, although Thy-1.2+ cells were found in the spleen and lymph nodes, similar cells could not be found in the CNS, and animals displayed neither clinical nor pathologic signs of EAE. Donor T lymphocytes appeared in the host CNS with clinical onset, 10 to 14 days after challenge. When mice went into remission, Thy-1.2+ lymphocytes could not be found in the CNS, but were still present in peripheral lymphoid organs up to 3 months after challenge. From the total number of infiltrating cells, T cell receptor-alpha beta+ cells constituted 27% in perivascular cuffs, 15% in meninges, and 13% in the parenchymal infiltrates in the spinal cord. Thy-1.2+ cells contributed up to about 40% of total T cell receptor-alpha beta+ lymphocytes. Approximately 60% of all infiltrating T cells expressed L3T4 (helper/inducer), whereas 18% expressed Lyt-2 (suppressor/cytotoxic). The majority of infiltrating cells were memory and activated cells expressing on their surface Pgp-1 and CD 25. Immunostaining for cytokines showed that the majority of infiltrating cells belonged to the TH1 subset and contained interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, while a minority were positive for interleukin-4. These results suggest that: (a) T lymphocytes from an EAE-resistant strain of mouse are capable of homing to the CNS; (b) T lymphocytes from an EAE-resistant strain express phenotypic characteristics, activation, memory, and cytokine profiles similar to infiltrating cells derived from susceptible strains; and (c) the presence of donor T cells in the recipient CNS correlates with clinical and histopathologic signs of EAE.",Immunology

The cation conductance was found to be non-selective since its permeability to other cations such as Na+ and choline, an organic compound highly concentrated in epididymal fluid, was similar to that of K+. 5. Regulatory volume decrease (RVD) was observed after initial osmotic swelling; this could be inhibited by either anion or cation channel blockers. 6. The results of this study suggest that both anion and cation conductances are activated during cellular swelling, and indicate the existence of an interdependent relationship between the swelling-induced cation and anion conductances. Both swelling-induced cation and anion conductances are involved in the volume regulatory process and may be responsible for transporting amino acids or organic compounds in human epididymal cells.",Immunology
7525609,"Distinct cell surface ligands mediate T lymphocyte attachment and rolling on P and E selectin under physiological flow. Memory T lymphocytes extravasate at sites of inflammation, but the mechanisms employed by these cells to initiate contact and tethering with endothelium are incompletely understood. An important part of leukocyte extravasation is the initiation of rolling adhesions on endothelial selectins; such events have been studied in monocytes and neutrophils but not lymphocytes. In this study, the potential of T lymphocytes to adhere and roll on endothelial selectins in vitro was investigated. We demonstrate that T cells can form tethers and rolling adhesions on P selectin and E selectin under physiologic flow conditions. Tethering and rolling on P selectin was independent of cell-surface cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) expression, which correlated strictly with the capacity of T cells to form rolling adhesions under flow on E selectin. T cell tethering to P selectin was abolished by selective removal of cell surface sialomucins by a P. haemolytica O-glycoprotease, while cutaneous lymphocyte antigen expression was unaffected. A sialomucin molecule identical or closely related to P selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), the major P selectin ligand on neutrophils and HL-60 cells, appears to be a major T cell ligand for P selectin. P selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 does not appear to support T cell rolling on E selectin. In turn, E selectin ligands do not appear to be associated with sialomucins. These data demonstrate the presence of structurally distinct ligands for P or E selectins on T cells, provide evidence that both ligands can be coexpressed on a single T cell, and mediate tethering and rolling on the respective selectins in a mutually exclusive fashion.",Immunology
7525328,"Rapid exit from G0/G1 phases of cell cycle in response to stem cell factor confers on umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells an enhanced ex vivo expansion potential. Currently, the most commonly used grafts of progenitor and stem cells for patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) are derived from large collections of autologous or allogeneic adult human bone marrow (BM). The feasibility of using human umbilical cord blood (HUCB), normal peripheral blood (PB), and smaller collections of BM as sources of hematopoietic stem cell grafts for adult patients remains questionable. We investigated the ex vivo proliferative potential of HUCB CD34+ cells as a means of expanding HUCB grafts, thereby making them more acceptable for clinical transplantation. HUCB-derived CD34+HLA-DR+ cells, maintained for 5 days in suspension cultures supplemented with 10% HUCB plasma and a combination of stem cell factor (SCF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3), displayed a 10-fold increase in the total number of CD34+ cells. In contrast, only a four-fold increase was observed in identical cultures initiated with BM-derived CD34+HLA-DR+ cells. Whereas BM CD34+ cells failed to proliferate in response to SCF alone, HUCB CD34+ cells expanded 5.6-fold by day 5, thus demonstrating an enhanced response to SCF. When the effects of SCF on the exit of HUCB cells from G0/G1 phases of cell cycle were investigated, we found that although HUCB CD34+HLA-DR+ cells were more quiescent than BM CD34+HLA-DR+ and BM CD34+HLA-DR- cells (97.5% of HUCB CD34+HLA-DR+ in G0/G1 vs. 88.6% of BM CD34+HLA-DR+ and 92.0% of BM CD34+HLA-DR- [p < 0.005]), HUCB CD34+HLA-DR+ cells exited from dormancy more rapidly than BM cells, such that by 36 to 48 hours following exposure to SCF, only 55% remained in G0/G1. Furthermore, an 8.4-fold increase in the number of HUCB CD34+ cells still residing in G0/G1 was observed on day 5 in cultures supplemented with SCF and IL-3, suggesting the generation of large numbers of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) in vitro. When the contribution of HUCB plasma to the exist of HUCB CD34+HLA-DR+ cells from G0/G1 phases of cell cycle was investigated, it was found that in serum-free media supplemented with only SCF or IL-3, HUCB cells did not exist G0/G1 as rapidly as when HUCB plasma or SCF plus IL-3 was present. In contrast, when HUCB plasma was added to any cytokine combination, it did not enhance the exist of BM CD34+HLA-DR+ cells from G0/G1 phases of cell cycle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Immunology

7524708,"Modeling state-dependent inactivation of membrane currents. Inactivation of many ion channels occurs through largely voltage-independent transitions to an inactivated state from the open state or from other states in the pathway leading to opening of the channel. Because this form of inactivation is state-dependent rather than voltage-dependent, it cannot be described by the standard Hodgkin-Huxley formalism used in virtually all modeling studies of neuronal behavior. Using two examples, cumulative inactivation of the Kv3 potassium channel and inactivation of the fast sodium channel, we extend the standard formalism for modeling macroscopic membrane currents to account for state-dependent inactivation. Our results provide an accurate description of cumulative inactivation of the Kv3 channel, new insight into inactivation of the sodium channel, and a general framework for modeling macroscopic currents when state-dependent processes are involved. In a model neuron, the macroscopic Kv3 current produces a novel short-term memory effect and firing delays similar to those seen in hippocampal neurons.",Immunology

7524448,"Arterial infusion chemotherapy in far advanced cancer. From 1978 to 1994, more than 2000 advanced cancers were treated by arterial infusion chemotherapy in the Department of Surgery, Kaohsiung Medical College Hospital. During these 16 years there are a lot of improvements in arterial therapy. The catheter changed from external catheter to implantable port catheter system. The infusion pump changed from spring driven pump to more accurate battery operated electric pump. But the principle of the higher the regional tumor drug exposure, the better the treatment result is the same. There are 3 main factors affecting the successful treatment, proper placement of the catheter, suitable selection of the drugs and adequate regional tumor blood supply. The first two factors can be improved by learning and experience. However, we can do little about the third one. The blood supply of the tumor had decided most of the outcome of the treatment. Those tumors over locations with very rich blood supply such as cancers of head, breast, external genitals and hands, always respond better to chemotherapy no matter the drugs were given regionally or systemically. Of course if the anticancer drug was administered by arterial route, very high concentration of anticancer drug can be delivered to the tumor region to induced rapid shrinkage of the tumor within a relative short time.",Immunology

EMG responses in the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and dorsal neck muscles (DNM) to vertical head acceleration were studied in normal subjects and in patients with spasmodic torticollis, standing on a platform that could be tilted upwards. The vertical body displacement and the induced changes in the head-neck angle (a flexion-extension sequence) were recorded. Excitatory responses, symmetrical on the two sides, were elicited in normal subjects in both muscle groups, at a latency of about 60 msec (DNM) and 90 msec (SCM). With the head initially extended, the latency of DNM response increased, leaving that of SCM unchanged. During an isometric rotatory effort, an early inhibitory period was recorded in the active muscles at a latency of about 40 msec. Downward tilt did not evoke the responses. The DNM excitatory responses appeared to be related to muscle stretch, while those in SCM, as well as the inhibitory responses in both muscles, were thought to originate in the vestibular receptors. During active head rotation the response increased in amplitude in the active SCM and decreased in the lengthened antagonist; decreased responses in the lengthened muscle persisted during passive head rotation. This was attributed to an influence from the tonic neck receptors. In the patients, SCM responses had normal latency, but were reduced in amplitude or absent in the dystonic muscle, in spite of tilt-induced head movements comparable to those recorded in normals. The diminution was even bigger if compared to normal subjects with the head actively rotated to a similar extent. It persisted when the head was returned to normal position by the ""geste antagoniste."" The inhibitory responses were unaffected in the active normal and dystonic muscles. The possible role of a deficit of the central vestibular connections in the decreased excitatory SCM response in dystonic patients is considered.",Immunology

The development of a technique for identifying murine type I interferon messenger RNAs is described that involves the following essential steps: (a) the reverse transcription of total RNA extracts using oligo(dT)12-18 as a primer, (b) the amplification of any type I interferon cDNAs produced by polymerase chain reaction, and (c) the identification of interferon subtypes by hybridization of the polymerase chain reaction products to specific oligonucleotides. The technique was used to characterize the expression of the mouse interferon subtypes alpha 1, alpha 4, alpha 5, alpha 6, and beta in murine L929 cells that had been infected with Newcastle disease virus. The data derived from this study are in excellent agreement with earlier RNA protection experiments performed in the same system to characterize expression of the same genes.

7520256,"Selective potentiation of NMDA-induced neuronal injury following induction of astrocytic iNOS.

In our murine cortical cell culture system, NMDA neurotoxicity was not blocked by addition of the NOS inhibitors, NG-nitro-L-arginine or aminoguanidine. However, following activation of inducible NOS in astrocytes by interleukin-1 beta plus interferon-gamma, NMDA but not kainate neurotoxicity was markedly potentiated. This selective potentiation of NMDA neurotoxicity was blocked by NOS inhibition or antioxidants (superoxide dismutase/catalase or Tempol) and could be mimicked by NO generators (SIN-1 or SNAP) or the oxygen radical generator, pyragallol. These results raise the possibility that NO production by astrocytes may contribute to NMDA receptor-mediated neuronal death, perhaps through interaction with oxygen radicals.",Immunology

7519271,"Regulation of the transcription of a cluster of Bacillus subtilis spore coat genes. The pattern of transcription has been examined for a cluster of genes encoding polypeptides some or all of which are assembled into a cross-linked component of the Bacillus subtilis spore coat. Three promoters, designated PVWX, PX and PYZ, were indicated by reverse transcriptase mapping. On the basis of Northern hybridization, it appeared that the cotV, W and X genes were transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA from PVWX as well as a monocistronic cotX mRNA from Px. The cotY and cotZ genes are cotranscribed from the PYZ promoter with a smaller cotY mRNA resulting from premature termination or RNA processing. All four transcripts were synthesized late during sporulation and were not produced in mutants lacking sigma K, which directs RNA polymerase to transcribe genes in the mother-cell compartment of sporulating cells. The DNA-binding protein GerE, which affects transcription of many genes in the mother cell during the late stages of sporulation, was also shown to be involved. There was essentially no cotX mRNA in a gerE mutant and the amounts of cotVWX, cotYZ and cotY mRNAs were somewhat reduced. In vitro run-off transcription studies with sigma K RNA polymerase and GerE confirmed the presence of the three promoters, and directly showed that GerE was necessary for transcription from PX as well as enhanced transcription from the PVWX and PYZ promoters. The DNase I footprints of GerE for all three promoters were immediately upstream of the -35 regions. These GerE binding sites were compared to those in other GerE-responsive promoters and a larger consensus sequence for GerE binding was recognized. This complex transcriptional pattern of the cotVWXYZ cluster is probably necessary to ensure that an optimal amount of each protein is made for the assembly of the spore coat.",Immunology

Many tumor-promoting chemicals inhibit gap junctional communication between cells. We investigated the possibility that antipromoting chemicals may act inversely and enhance gap junctional communication. The V79/metabolic cooperation assay is an in vitro test that measures gap junctional communication indirectly by determining the extent of metabolic cooperation between mutant and wild-type V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts in culture. Six in vivo antipromoters (caffeine, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), phenidone, dibromoacetophenone, tosylphenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), and acetic acid) were tested in this assay to assess their effects on metabolic cooperation. Caffeine, IBMX, phenidone, and dibromoacetophenone had no effect on metabolic cooperation, while TPCK slightly inhibited metabolic cooperation in one V79 assay. Acetic acid appeared to facilitate metabolic cooperation. In tests where an antipromoter was combined with the established tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), acetic acid, caffeine, and IBMX counteracted PMA-induced inhibition of metabolic cooperation, while phenidone, dibromoacetophenone, and TPCK had little effect. These results indicate that some antipromoters interfere with the ability of a tumor-promoting chemical to inhibit metabolic cooperation and suggest that alteration of gap junctional communication can be a mechanism of antipromoter action.",Immunology

A neutralization-resistant variant of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) that emerged during in vitro propagation of the virus in the presence of neutralizing serum from an infected individual has been described. A threonine-for-alanine substitution at position 582 in the gp41 transmembrane envelope glycoprotein of the variant virus was responsible for the neutralization-resistant phenotype (M.S. Reitz, Jr., C. Wilson, C. Naugle, R. C. Gallo, and M. Robert-Guroff, Cell 54:57-63, 1988). The mutant virus also exhibited reduced sensitivity to neutralization by 30% of HIV-1-positive sera that neutralized the parental virus, suggesting that a significant fraction of the neutralizing activity within these sera can be affected by the amino acid change in gp41 (C. Wilson, M. S. Reitz, Jr., K. Aldrich, P. J. Klasse, J. Blomberg, R. C. Gallo, and M. Robert-Guroff, J. Virol. 64:3240-3248, 1990). It is shown here that the change of alanine 582 to threonine specifically confers resistance to neutralizing by antibodies directed against both groups of discontinuous, conserved epitopes related to the CD4 binding site on the gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein. Only minor differences in binding of these antibodies to wild-type and mutant envelope glycoproteins were observed. Thus, the antigenic structure of gp120 can be subtly affected by an amino acid change in gp41, with important consequences for sensitivity to neutralization.",Immunology

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection of mononuclear phagocytes has been implicated in disease manifestations, but postentry viral replication events in these cells have not been well characterized. Productive infection of activated T cells is associated with cell proliferation and accumulation of full-length viral DNA within 6 h. In infected, nondividing quiescent peripheral blood lymphocytes, reverse transcription is aborted prior to full-length viral DNA formation. For nondividing, cultured mononuclear phagocytes, we now report a third pattern of reverse transcription with relatively slow kinetics, in which full-length viral DNA did not accumulate until 36 to 48 h. The reverse transcription rate in mononuclear phagocytes could be accelerated by addition of exogenous nucleotide precursors, but still not to the rate seen in activated T cells.

No other age-adjusted clinical parameter was significantly associated with delta F508 or any other genotype. These data suggest that in this sample of CF patients, delta F508 genotype is not predictive of disease severity.

At the lower dose, SP had no effect on cortisol output. In contrast, SP inhibited the output of both catecholamines and enkephalins in response to acetylcholine, without affecting the output of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). Increasing the dose of SP to 20 pmol.min-1.kg-1 ia significantly reduced the outputs of both cortisol and CRF (P < 0.025 and 0.01 respectively).

The mutagenicity of the antitumor agent ICR-170 (2-methoxy-6-chloro-9-[(ethyl-2-chloroethyl)amino propylamino] acridine dihydrochloride) in the adenine-3 (ad-3) region was studied with a two-component heterokaryon (H-12) of Neurospora crassa. The objective was to characterize the genetic damage produced by this acridine nitrogen mustard derivative to determine in a lower eukaryotic organism the basis for its potent activity against ascites tumors in mice. As in higher eukaryotes, specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region of strain H-12 result from gene/point mutations, multiple-locus mutations, and multilocus deletion mutations at the closely linked ad-3A and ad-3B loci. Six different treatments of conidial suspensions of H-12 with ICR-170 were used to obtain dose-response curves for inactivation of conidia as well as the overall induction of ad-3 forward mutations using a direct method based on pigment accumulation rather than a requirement for adenine. These experiments demonstrated that: (1) the slope of the dose-response curve for ICR-170-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region was 1.97 +/- 0.02, and (2) ICR-170 is a potent mutagen (maximum forward-mutation frequency between 1000 and 10,000 ad-3 mutations per 10(6) survivors) for the induction of specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region. Both biochemical and classical genetic tests were used to characterize the ICR-170-induced ad-3 mutations from each of the six treatments to distinguish the different genotypic classes and subclasses. The overall data base demonstrates that ICR-170-induced ad-3 mutations result exclusively from gene/point mutations at the ad-3A and ad-3B loci and not multilocus deletion mutations. In addition, the frequency of multiple-locus ad-3 mutations resulting from gene/point mutations at the ad-3A and ad-3B loci with a separate site of recessive lethal damage elsewhere in the genome increases as a function of dose. However, an exceptionally high frequency of multiple-locus ad-3 mutations consisting of gene/point mutations at the ad-3A and ad-3B loci with a separate site of closely linked recessive lethal damage was found at all doses. Comparison of the dose-response curves for the major classes and subclasses of ICR-170-induced ad-3 mutations demonstrates that the gene/point ad-3 mutations and multiple-locus ad-3 mutations with a separate site of recessive lethal damage elsewhere in the genome have different induction kinetics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Immunology

7523104,"Regulation of antioxidant enzymes in lung after oxidant injury. Studies have implicated active oxygen species (AOS) in the pathogenesis of various lung diseases. Many chemical and physical agents in the environment are potent generators of AOS, including ozone, hyperoxia, mineral dusts, paraquat, etc. These agents produce AOS by different mechanisms, but frequently the lung is the primary target of toxicity, and exposure results in damage to lung tissue to varying degrees. The lung has developed defenses to AOS-mediated damage, which include antioxidant enzymes, the superoxide dismutases [copper-zinc (CuZnSOD) and manganese-containing (MnSOD)], catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). In this review, antioxidant defenses to environmental stresses in the lung as well as in isolated pulmonary cells following exposure to a number of different oxidants, are summarized. Each oxidant appears to induce a different pattern of antioxidant enzyme response in the lung, although some common trends, i.e., induction of MnSOD following oxidants inducing inflammation or pulmonary fibrosis, in responses to oxidants occur. Responses may vary between the different cell types in the lung as a function of cell-cycle or other factors. Increases in MnSOD mRNA or immunoreactive protein in response to certain oxidants may serve as a biomarker of AOS-mediated damage in the lung.",Immunology

Deletion mutants or receptors with point mutations of the highly conserved cysteine residues were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells to evaluate PTH binding and PTH-stimulated cAMP production. Deletion of residues 61-105, which are encoded by exon E2 in the PTH/PTH-related peptide receptor gene, did not affect receptor function. An epitope derived from Haemophilus influenza hemagglutinin was, therefore, introduced into this portion of most receptors to allow the independent assessment of cell surface expression. PTH binding capacity was not reduced by the deletion of residues 258-278 in the first extracellular loop. Receptors with deletion of either residues 31-47 in the amino-terminal extension or residues 431-440 in the third extracellular loop failed to bind PTH, although expression of the receptor on the cell surface was only marginally reduced. Most other receptor mutants, including those in which each of the six cysteines in the amino-terminus was replaced by serines, failed to be processed and/or expressed appropriately, whereas the substitution of cysteine-281 or -351 had a less severe effect. The combined replacement of both cysteines concomitantly increased PTH binding and cell surface expression, suggesting the formation of a disulfide bond between these two residues. Our data indicate that residues near the amino-terminus and within the third extracellular loop are necessary for ligand binding, whereas more than 25% of the receptor's extracellular region appears not to be involved.",Immunology
7523096,"Human fibroblasts secrete a serine protease that cleaves insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5. We have previously reported the presence of proteolytic activity in conditioned medium from human fibroblast cultures that cleaves insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) into non-IGF-I-binding fragments. Coincubation of IGF-I or IGF-II and IGFBP-5 with fibroblast cultures decreased proteolysis. The protease was purified by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The purified protease cleaved IGFBP-5 into 22-, 20-, and 17-kilodalton non-IGF-I-binding fragments. Protease inhibitor profiles obtained using partially purified enzyme showed that it was a calcium-dependent serine protease. After chelation with EDTA, the activity could only be partially restored with zinc, indicating that it was probably not a metalloprotease. The protease was specific for IGFBP-5 and did not cleave pure IGFBP-1, -2, -3, or -4. IGF-I and IGF-II caused minimal inhibition of proteolysis in vitro. This suggests that the IGF-I-induced increase in IGFBP-5 in fibroblast medium is only partially due to direct protease inhibition. Heparin, antithrombin-III (AT-III), and heparin cofactor-II had inhibitory activity, and heparin potentiated the activity of AT-III. Synthetic peptides, that contained the active sites of AT-III and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, were also inhibitory. Peptides containing sequences found in two basic regions of IGFBP-5 were tested, and one had inhibitory activity. In summary, fibroblasts secrete a serine protease that cleaves IGFBP-5 and is specific for this form of IGFBP. The protease has properties that are similar to kallikreins, a family of serine proteases that is known to cleave epidermal and nerve growth factor-binding proteins.",Immunology
7523030,"Vitreal insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) are increased in human and animal diabetics. Although patients with diabetic retinopathy have been reported to have elevated vitreal IGF-I levels, it is not known whether diabetes also affects the levels of vitreal IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) which control IGF's bioavailability. To address this issue, vitreal IGFBP levels were assayed in human diabetics, rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and galactose-fed dogs with diabetic-like retinopathy. Using 125I-IGF-II ligand blots, it was found that human diabetics have a 4-fold increase in vitreal IGFBP levels. Also, western blots on human diabetic vitreous reveal increased levels of IGFBP-2 and proteolytic fragments of IGFBP-3. IGF binding assays on vitreous from streptozotocin-treated rats (three months in duration) also indicate a 5-fold increase in IGF binding activity. IGF ligand blots using vitreous from rats with a shorter duration of diabetes (one month) show a 63% increase in IGFBP binding and a marked decrease in serum IGFBP binding. IGF ligand blots and IGFBP-2 and -4 western blots using vitreous from galactose-fed dogs with diabetic-like retinopathy exhibit a 6-fold increase in vitreal IGFBPs. The observation that vitreal IGFBPs are elevated in diabetic humans and rats without overt retinopathy suggests that these increases are not the result of a preexisting end-stage retinopathy but rather are an early ocular event in the diabetic process. Increases in vitreal IGFBPs thus could participate in the proliferative aspects of diabetic retinopathy by virtue of their putative intrinsic bioactivity or their capacity to alter IGF bioavailability.",Immunology

The present study was performed on 22 cats to explore whether r-aminobutyric acid (GABA), endogenous opioid peptide and substance P (SP) were involved in the regulation of presynaptic inhibition in acupuncture analgesia. The size of the antidromic compound C action potentials of the sural nerve evoked by the testing stimulation in spinal cord was measured as an indicator of C-afferent terminal excitability. It was found that the electro-acupuncture (EA) at ""Huantiao"" (GB30) and ""Yang lingquan"" (GB34) points induced significant enlargement of the antidromic C-waves, showing the depolarization of presynaptic terminals of primary C-afferents was enhanced. The depolarization effect of EA was significantly reduced by bicuculline, naloxone and the antiserum of SP locally applied to the surface of spinal cord respectively. It is supposed that GABA, endogenous opioid peptide and SP may be involved in the regulation of presynaptic inhibition in acupuncture analgesia.",Immunology

The aim of the study is to estimate the new tumor marker CYFRA 21-1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and comparison of this results with SCC-Ag. The investigation was carried out on 115 NSCLC patients (55 with squamous cell, 35 with adenocarcinoma, 25 with large cell) qualified for surgical treatment and in 48 nonmalignant lung diseases patients. CYFRA 21-1 was determined by the means of IRMA method (CIS bio international--GIF-SUR-Yvette, France) and SCC-Ag--MEIA method (IMx system Abbott). Elevated levels of CYFRA 21-1 were obtained in 48.7% and SCC-Ag in 39.1%. Elevated levels of examined markers most frequently occurred in squamous cell type (SCC). It was found out that CYFRA 21-1 dependent on: a) SCC stage (I-40%, II-61.1%, III-85.2%), b) tumor size (T1-38.4%, T2-73.1%, T3-87.5%), c) mediastinal lymph nodes metastases (No and N1-53.8% and N2-86.9%). Similar correlations were not observed in SCC-Ag examination. Simultaneous determination of CYFRA 21-1 and SCC-Ag showed minimal sensitivity increase from 48.7% to 52.1% in NSCLC and from 69.1% to 70.1% in SCC and decrease of specificity from 95.8% to 85.4%.

7522635,"Expression of recombinant transmembrane CD59 in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria B cells confers resistance to human complement. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired hematopoietic disorder characterized by complement-mediated hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, and venous thrombosis. These clinical manifestations arise from an underlying molecular defect of bone marrow stem cells. Specifically, somatic mutations in the phosphatidylinositol glycan class A gene result in the ability of blood cells to anchor complement-regulatory proteins (CD59 and DAF) to the cell surface via glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI). In an attempt to circumvent the functional defect in PNH cells, a recombinant transmembrane form of CD59 (CD59-TM) was analyzed for the ability to regulate complement activity. Balb/3T3 stable transfectants expressing similar levels of either CD59-TM or native CD59 (CD59-GPI) were equally protected against human complement-mediated membrane damage. Treatment of these cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C failed to release CD59-TM from the cell surface. Retroviral transduction of GPI-anchoring deficient mouse L cells with CD59-TM resulted in surface expression of the protein and rendered these cells resistant to human complement-mediated membrane damage. Conversely, L cells transduced with CD59-GPI failed to express this protein on the cell surface. A GPI-anchoring deficient complement-sensitive B-cell line derived from a PNH patient was successfully transduced with CD59-TM, resulting in surface expression of the protein. The PNH B cells expressing CD59-TM were protected against classical complement-mediated membrane damage by human serum. Taken together, these data establish that a functional recombinant transmembrane form of CD59 can be expressed on the surface of GPI-anchoring deficient PNH cells and suggest that retroviral gene therapy with this molecule could provide a treatment for PNH patients.",Immunology
7522622,"Protein-tyrosine kinase p72syk in Fc gamma RI receptor signaling. In this report we show that gamma-interferon (IFN) induces the expression of the nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase, p72syk, and that cross-linking the Fc gamma RI receptor in IFN-differentiated U937 cells (U937IF cells) results in the activation of syk kinase. We show that syk is tyrosine phosphorylated (12-fold increase) after Fc gamma RI cross-linking. In vitro kinase assays demonstrate that the specific kinase activity of syk increased eightfold after Fc gamma RI cross-linking. The activation of signal transduction through the Fc gamma RI receptor, as measured by the respiratory burst, is associated with the tyrosine phosphorylation and catalytic activation of the syk kinase. We show that syk coprecipitates with the gamma subunit of the Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RI gamma. The data suggest that p72syk is involved in signal transduction through the Fc gamma RI receptor, involving the Fc gamma RI gamma subunit.",Immunology

Immunocytochemistry using antibodies against phosphotyrosine was employed to identify changes in tyrosine phosphorylation in the rat spinal cord consequent to sciatic nerve injury. Increased immunostaining in the spinal gray matter, dorsal columns and gracile nucleus on the side of the lesion became evident after 3 days and was more pronounced with longer survival times up to 3 weeks (the longest survival tested). This increase was most prominent in the fourth lumbar segment (the focus of termination of sciatic nerve afferents). Immunostaining was ain astroglial cells and their processes in the dorsal horn; stained microglia were also seen. Immunopositivity also increased in glial cells surrounding motoneurons at the same levels. These changes suggest that a diffusible growth factor released centrally by injured nerve fibers activates tyrosine phosphorylation in glial cells via receptor tyrosine kinases.",Immunology
7522241,"Neuronal nitric oxide synthase is localized in extrinsic nerves regulating perireceptor processes in the chemosensory nasal mucosae of rats and humans. Nitric oxide synthase is the enzyme responsible for the production of the free radical gas nitric oxide, which has been implicated as an intercellular messenger in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Immunoreactivity for nitric oxide synthase is often coincident with the histochemical demonstration of NADPH-diaphorase activity. Using an antibody to the neuronal form of nitric oxide synthase and a histochemical technique for NADPH-diaphorase, we have compared the localization of immunoreactivity and histochemical reaction product in the nasal mucosae of rats and humans. Immunoreactivity for neuronal nitric oxide synthase was localized in the extrinsic perivascular innervation of the olfactory and vomeronasal mucosae of rats and in the olfactory mucosa of humans. In the rat nasal mucosa, specific groups of glands were also innervated; the density of nitrinergic innervation varied among them, with vomeronasal glands and posterior glands of the nasal septum being the most densely innervated. In contrast, NADPH-diaphorase activity was present in olfactory, vomeronasal, and septal organ receptor neurons in rats and in olfactory receptor neurons in humans as well as in numerous nerve fibers, glands, and surface epithelial cells. The localization of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in extrinsic perivascular and periglandular nerve fibers suggests that nitric oxide may modulate the perireceptor processes of local blood flow and mucus secretion that influence the access to and clearance of chemical stimuli from rat and human chemosensory mucosae.",Immunology

Recently serum levels of HCV RNA (s-HCV RNA) in chronic hepatitis C has been regarded as one of an important indicator for the activity of disease and outcome of IFN therapy. Quantitative analysis by competitive RT-PCR, however, requires special skills and is too expensive for clinical use. We attempted to determine serial sample of s-HCV RNA and genotypes in 117 cases treated with IFN using bDNA probe assay which has lately been developed by Chiron corporation. Cases with complete response to IFN therapy showed 62% (49/79) in lower than 10(6) levels, 27% (8/30) in 10(6)-10(7) and only 5% (2/41) in higher than 10(7).

Sequence heterogeneities among the clones were generally high but they appeared to be significantly lowered after cessation of therapy. Our results showed, through IFN therapy, a few clones were selected and survived, although many clones disappeared. After discontinuation of the drug, three patients became carrier state, normal ALT levels with viremia. Evolution of defective viruses was seen in most of the cases. These features of HCV genome suggest that the virus could circulate as an extremely heterogeneous population including defective virus, and that this heterogeneity lend itself to selection pressures including interferon therapy and host immune response.",Immunology
7521375,"Differential expression of genes encoding a cysteine-rich keratin family in the hair cuticle. In the hair follicle the cuticle develops as a thin layer of cells between the hair shaft cortex and the inner root sheath. Once the cuticle cells begin to differentiate they accumulate cysteine-rich granules in their cytoplasm but the identity of their constituent proteins has remained largely an enigma. In this report we show differential expression of a family of genes encoding cysteine-rich, glycine-rich keratins in the cuticle. Two clones of the sheep KAP5 gene family were isolated: the KAP5.4 cDNA encodes a protein of 190 amino acids (M(r) = 16,936) containing 32 mol% cysteine, 26 mol% glycine and the partial KAP5.5 cDNA encodes a protein of at least 197 amino acids (M(r) > or = 17,474) containing 29 mol% cysteine, 28 mol% glycine. The predicted amino acid sequences of the KAP5 family show extensive sequence conservation and all the proteins are composed almost entirely of cysteine-rich and glycine-rich repeats. Each KAP5 gene produces an approximately 1.5-kb mRNA species but the KAP5.4 and KAP5.5 mRNA levels appear to be severalfold greater than the KAP5.1 mRNA. Comparative tissue in situ hybridizations reveal a positive correlation between the onset of expression and follicle depth. For a given KAP5 gene two widely different cuticle expression patterns were noted amongst the follicle populations, and on the basis of follicle bulb cell kinetics they are consistent with expression in either sheep primary or secondary follicle types.",Immunology

C3H/OuJ (Lpsn) macrophages are induced by wild-type LPS, rough LPS, or lipid A to express many genes, including TNF-alpha, TNFR-2, IL-1 beta, IP-10, D3, and D8. C3H/HeJ macrophages failed to induce any of these genes when cultured with wild-type LPS or synthetic lipid A, even when pretreated with IFN-gamma. However, rough mutant Salmonella minnesota Ra, Rc, and Rd LPS, and Escherichia coli D31 m3 Rd LPS induced Lpsd macrophages to express a subset of genes within the gene panel. Because bioactive preparations contained trace quantities of endotoxin protein(s), a deoxycholate-modified, phenol-water method was used to repurify rough LPS into an aqueous phase, and extract endotoxin proteins into a phenol phase. Repurified LPS failed to stimulate Lpsd macrophages; however, phenol fractions were approximately 10% as potent in Lpsd macrophages as crude rough LPS. Full potency was restored in C3H/HeJ macrophages when aqueous phase LPS and phenol-phase proteins were co-precipitated, suggesting that LPS and endotoxin proteins interact synergistically. Endotoxin proteins alone induced TNF-alpha, TNFR-2, and IL-1 beta, but not IP-10, D3, and D8 genes in both Lpsd and Lpsn macrophages. Tyrosine phosphorylation of three 41- to 47-kDa proteins was induced by endotoxin proteins, but not by LPS, in Lpsd macrophages. Thus, endotoxin proteins seem to activate a signaling pathway(s) that converges (distal to the Lps gene product) with a subset of LPS-signaling pathways.",Immunology

7520457,"Projections to the cochlear nuclei from principal cells in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body in guinea pigs. Spherical and globular cells in the cochlear nucleus provide input to the cell groups in the superior olivary complex devoted to the analysis of binaural cues. Descending projections from the superior olivary complex appear to inhibit the spherical and globular cells. It is not known which of the numerous cell types in the superior olive provide this descending input, but recent studies have shown that some of the cells are located in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MTB). The present experiments were designed to determine whether the MTB projections arise from principal cells, which are known to play a role in sound localization, and to determine whether their projections terminate on spherical or globular cells. Principal cells in the MTB are characterized by their contacts with synaptic specializations called calyces, which arise from the axons of cells in the contralateral cochlear nucleus. In the first experiment, a fluorescent tracer was injected into one cochlear nucleus to label the calyces anterogradely. A different tracer was injected into the opposite cochlear nucleus to label cells retrogradely in the MTB. In every case, some of the labeled cells were enveloped by a labeled calyx, demonstrating that principal cells do project to the cochlear nucleus. In the second experiment, fluorescent tracers were injected into different parts of the cochlear nucleus. Analysis of the distribution of labeled cells suggested that MTB projections selectively target the globular cell region of the cochlear nucleus. In a third experiment, the axonal arborizations arising from this projection were labeled with biocytin or wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Labeled boutons appeared to contact globular cells but not spherical cells. Multipolar cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus and cells in the dorsal cochlear nucleus were also contacted. The results suggest that MTB projections to the cochlear nucleus arise largely from principal cells and contact, at least in part, cells in the cochlear nucleus that give rise to ascending pathways involved in sound localization.",Immunology

To determine the stoichiometry of Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport in fetal human nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells and the effect of forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, on Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport. 86Rb+ as a marker for K+ was used to study ouabain-insensitive, bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake in cultured human nonpigmented epithelial (NPE) monolayers. The dependence of ouabain-insensitive, bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake upon Na+, K+, and Cl- concentrations was determined. Maximal uptake was observed at about 12 mM, 20 mM, and 120 mM of these ions, respectively. Analysis by Hill plot suggested that the stoichiometry of Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport is 1:1:2, making this an electroneutral process. Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport was found to be stimulated approximately 1.5- to 2-fold after incubation of cells for 15 minutes with 1 microM forskolin. neither ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake nor bumetanide-insensitive, ouabain-insensitive uptake was affected. 8-Bromoadenosine cAMP and 8-chlorophenylthio cAMP at 1 mM stimulated Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport approximately 30% to 40%, whereas 1,9 dideoxyforskolin, a non-adenylyl cyclase-activating analogue of forskolin, had little effect. Stimulation of Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport by forskolin was blocked by prior exposure of cells to 10 microM H-89, a protein kinase A inhibitor. Stimulation by forskolin was also observed in the presence of either 1 mM DIDS, 30 microM NPPB, 3 mM DPC, or 5 mM BaCl2, although all four channel blockers inhibited Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport to various degrees. The data suggest that the human NPE Na+,K+,Cl- cotransporter transports Na+, K+, and Cl- in the ratio of 1:1:2. Activation of adenylyl cyclase stimulates Na+,K+,Cl(-)-cotransport via a mechanism involving protein kinase A. Reduction of Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport by chloride channel blockers raises the possibility that activities of some ion channels can influence the rate of ion influx via Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport.",Immunology

This Musca protein, designated Musca PRI, changes its pI upon illumination in vivo. Drosophila PRI. This Musca protein, designated Musca PRI, changes its pI upon illumination in vivo. (2) Rabbit antibodies raised against Musca PRI, against bovine arrestin, and against a synthetic peptide based on the Drosophila PRI sequence stained the Drosophila and Musca PRIs specifically on 1 and 2-dimensional Western immunoblots. (3) Both Drosophila and Musca PRIs incorporated 32P-radioactivity from gamma-32P-ATP in cell-free homogenates of retinas. Partial peptide digestions of Drosophila and Musca PRIs revealed similarity between these proteins. We observed that Drosophila PRI exists in the random preparation, but it also exists in other subcellular fractions. Immunocytochemistry at the EM level revealed a distribution of both Drosophila and Musca PRI epitopes in membranous vesicular structures in the cytosol as well as in the rhabdomeric microvillar membranes where the visual pigment, rhodopsin, exists. Such distribution of PRI epitopes suggests that PRI and its light-dependent phosphorylation may function in a space remote from the rhabdomere as well as the immediate milieu of photoreception.",Immunology

CD34 is expressed on human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and its clinical usefulness for the purification of stem cells has been well established. However, a similar pattern of expression for murine CD34 (mCD34) has not yet been determined. Two polyclonal anti-mCD34 antibodies that specifically recognize both endogenous and recombinant murine CD34 were developed to characterize the mCD34 protein and to determine its pattern of expression on murine cell lines and hematopoietic progenitor cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis showed that mCD34 is expressed on NIH/3T3 embryonic fibroblasts, PA6 stromal cells, embryonic stem cells, M1 leukemia cells, and a subpopulation of normal bone marrow cells. Murine CD34 was found to be a glycoprotein expressed on the cell surface as either a full-length (approximately 100 kD) or truncated (approximately 90 kD) protein in NIH/3T3 and PA6 cells. Recombinant full-length CD34, when expressed in the CHO-K1 cell line, had a molecular weight of approximately 105 kD. Full-length CD34 expressed on M1 leukemia cells, had a higher apparent molecular weight (110 kD). These results suggest that there are glycosylation differences between CD34 expressed by different cell types.

The specific transfer of normal chromosomes via microcell fusion has been instrumental in identifying putative tumor suppressor gene loci in a variety of human cancers. Using this same technique it has been proposed that the tumorigenicity of the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 is controlled by functionally distinct tumor suppressor genes on human chromosomes I and II. To address these results and perhaps further localize the suppressive effect to particular regions on these two chromosomes, we transferred into HT1080 seven different fibroblast-derived human chromosomes containing either intact or discrete portions of chromosome I or II. Interestingly, we found no evidence of genes on these chromosomes that could alter the growth of HT1080 either in vitro or in vivo. Based on these results we were left with the possibility that a gene, or genes, residing on an entirely different chromosome(s) was involved in the tumorigenesis of HT1080. Since TP53 mutation has been documented in a variety of human tumor types, and we found both copies of TP53 to be mutated in HT1080, we were prompted to examine its role by both cDNA transfection and chromosome transfer. Although by cDNA transfection we found that expression of exogenous wild-type TP53 was incompatible with continued proliferation of HT1080 cells in vitro, chromosome 17 transfer studies revealed that a more physiologic expression of exogenous wild-type TP53 could be tolerated in vitro while being completely incompatible with growth in vivo. These studies demonstrate a differential effect of TP53 growth inhibition and clearly show that TP53 tumor suppressing function can be independent from its potent growth suppressing effect in vitro.",Immunology

The present study evaluated pancreatotrophic factors after massive small bowel resection. Specifically, we examined the role of enteroglucagon in compensatory pancreatic hyperplasia after proximal small bowel resection (PSBR) by using rats fed a fiber-free elemental diet or an elemental diet containing pectin. PSBR increased the net pancreatic weight as well as the protein, DNA, RNA, and amylase contents, and elevated plasma enteroglucagon levels. Pectin addition to the diet provoked a further increase in these parameters and significant positive correlations were found between the plasma enteroglucagon levels and the protein, DNA, and RNA contents of the pancreas. Plasma gastrin and CCK levels were not affected by the small bowel resection. These results indicate that enteroglucagon may exert a potent trophic effect on the pancreas after PSBR.",Immunology
7515917,"Recombinant soluble CD14 inhibits LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha production by cells in whole blood. CD14 functions as a cell surface receptor for LPS in the activation of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils by endotoxin. To assess the utility of soluble forms of the CD14 receptor as a possible therapeutic for endotoxin shock, we have produced recombinant human soluble CD14 using a baculovirus expression system. We find that the recombinant protein is not only expressed on the surface of the insect cells as a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, but is also released into the culture medium as a soluble form that lacks the GPI anchor. Functional analyses of recombinant human soluble CD14 show that it binds specifically to LPS and can inhibit the LPS-induced release of TNF-alpha by macrophages and mononuclear cells as well as by cells in whole human blood when used at concentrations of approximately 70 micrograms/ml. Thus, soluble CD14 may be useful as an adjunct in the treatment of endotoxin shock.",Immunology
7515905,"Primary olfactory fibres project to the ventral telencephalon and preoptic region in trout (Salmo trutta): a developmental immunocytochemical study. We studied the development of the primary olfactory system of a teleost, the brown trout, with the aims of clarifying whether the caudal projection pertains to the olfactory or to the terminal nerve system, of identifying the brain regions receiving this projection, and of investigating its possible functional significance. As olfactory markers (OMs) we used two polyclonal antibodies (to substance P and to alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone) that were found to label the olfactory projection strongly after preadsortion of the antibody with the corresponding antigen (OMs), and as a terminal nerve marker we used an antiserum to FMRF-amide peptide. OM labelling was observed in both perikarya and axons of olfactory neurons. In adults, olfactory neurons projected not only to olfactory glomeruli in the olfactory bulb but also, as has been reported previously, to more caudal targets in the forebrain through the medial olfactory tract. Our results show that these targets include the ventral and commissural nuclei of the area ventralis telencephali, the periventricular preoptic region, and the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis. Glomeruli were not observed before hatching, and the extrabulbar olfactory projections appear late in development. Extensive periventricular preoptic olfactory plexuses and olfactory innervation of the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis did not appear until adulthood. The cells of the ganglion nervus terminalis, which form ganglionic groups along the olfactory nerves, were not stained with these olfactory markers at any developmental stage studied, nor was the medial olfactory tract FMRP-amide peptide immunoreactive. Our results thus confirm the existence of primary olfactory projections to extrabulbar targets in trout. The target regions identified in this study are implicated in sexual behaviour: We discuss the related possibility that, in teleosts, these extrabulbar olfactory projections (rather than projections of the terminal nerve, as is widely held) are the primary mediators of neuroendocrine response to pheromones.",Immunology

Sera from patients with connective tissue diseases exhibit autoantibodies to a spectrum of extracellular matrix proteins. Antibodies binding to solid phase bovine fibronectin (Fn) were investigated by ELISA in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Sera showing binding of 2 s.d. above the mean of the normal human control were considered positive and 43/150 SLE sera (28.7%) demonstrated such binding. These antibodies were mainly IgG and IgA as determined by isotype-specific ELISA. Specificity studies on selected positive sera revealed that binding was inhibited by preincubation with soluble Fn, but not with thyroglobulin or type 1 collagen. The binding was demonstrated not to be related to interactions with rheumatoid factor, complement components or immune complexes. Additional studies to determine which Fn fragment is bound by naturally occurring anti-Fn antibodies demonstrated that the binding was predominantly to the 30-kD collagen binding domain (CBD) of Fn molecule. Inhibition studies using 120-kD, 40-kD and 30-kD Fn fragments confirmed that this binding site was the 30-kD CBD.",Immunology
7509464,"Effects of hypophysectomy on galaninergic neurons in the rat hypothalamus. To understand better the relationship between hypothalamic galaninergic neurons and the pituitary gland, we studied the effects of hypophysectomy on hypothalamic galanin (GAL) content and distribution by radioimmunoassay and immunohistochemistry, and on GAL mRNA by Northern blot analysis. Three weeks after hypophysectomy, performed at 5 or 8 weeks of age, the hypothalamic concentrations of GAL and GAL mRNA were reduced by 30-50% in both male and female rats, compared to age- and sex-matched controls. Similar reverse-phase HPLC retention times of hypothalamic GAL were observed in intact and hypophysectomized rats. The reduction of hypothalamic GAL concentration following hypophysectomy was time-dependent, as peptide levels were unaffected one week after surgery. Immunohistochemistry showed regional differences in the effect of hypophysectomy on galaninergic neurons. In the hypophysiotropic hypothalamus, the scarce GAL immunoreactivity normally observed in the arcuate nuclei was no longer detectable in hypophysectomized rats, and the intense GAL immunoreactivity of the external zone of the median eminence progressively decreased and completely disappeared 3 and 6 weeks after hypophysectomy. In contrast, in the neurohypophyseal system, there was an increase of GAL labelling of the perikarya and emerging axons in the supraoptic and lateral-paraventricular nuclei, 1 and 3 weeks after hypophysectomy, that disappeared 6 weeks after hypophysectomy. An increase of GAL immunoreactivity was also observed in the internal zone of the median eminence 1 week but not 3 weeks after hypophysectomy. We conclude that hypophysectomy reduces the content of GAL and GAL mRNA in the rat hypothalamus. These changes are time-dependent and clearly detected after 3 weeks. The neurohypophyseal and hypophysiotropic galaninergic systems respond differently to hypophysectomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology
7507838,"Functional specificity for salmon gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and chicken GnRH-II coupled to the gonadotropin release and subunit messenger ribonucleic acid level in the goldfish pituitary. GnRH is the key regulator of reproduction in the vertebrates. In this study, we investigated the release and synthesis of maturational gonadotropin hormone (GTH-II) stimulated by native GnRH forms, salmon GnRH (sGnRH) and chicken GnRH-II (cGnRH-II), in the goldfish pituitary. The experimental approach was to study the differences between desensitization induced by sGnRH and cGnRH-II administered in homologous and heterologous fashion. Pulsatile alternate treatments with sGnRH and cGnRH-II (i.e. sGnRH/cGnRH-II or cGnRH-II/sGnRH) at 10(-8) M (every 30 min) resulted in a lower degree of desensitization compared with homologous treatments with either sGnRH or cGnRH-II (sGnRH/sGnRH or cGnRH-II/cGnRH-II), or when combined together (sGnRH+cGNRH-II). We also investigated the effects of continuous treatments with sGnRH and cGnRH-II, administered in a homologous or heterologous fashion. Increasing concentrations of either sGnRH or cGnRH-II (10(-8)-10(-6) M) administered continuously (60 min) in a homologous fashion resulted in significant desensitization of the pituitary GTH-II release. Alternate continuous treatments with sGnRH and cGnRH-II (i.e. sGnRH/cGnRH-II/sGnRH or cGnRH-II/sGnRH/cGnRH-II) resulted in lower degree of desensitization compared to homologous treatments, particularly at lower doses. We further investigated the effects of sGnRH and cGnRH-II on GTH-II beta and GTH-II alpha subunit messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the goldfish pituitary. In sexually regressed animals, sGnRH treatment (4 micrograms/fish) increased the accumulation of GTH-II beta and GTH-II alpha mRNA, whereas cGnRH-II treatment was without effect. In sexually mature animals, however, both cGnRH-II and sGnRH stimulated accumulation of GTH-II beta and GTH-II alpha mRNA, with cGnRH-II exerting a greater effect on GTH-II subunit mRNA production. These results suggest a differential control of GTH-II subunit gene expression or mRNA stabilization by sGnRH and cGnRH-II in the goldfish pituitary based on the stage of gonadal recrudescence. In general, the present findings support the hypothesis that sGnRH and cGnRH-II regulate the release and synthesis of GTH-II through different receptor-effector mechanisms in the goldfish pituitary.",Immunology

Cytogenetic data on cultured lymphocytes of the in utero exposed A-bomb survivors in the RERF Adult Health Study cohort have been analyzed using the G-banding technique to determine the frequency of aneuploid cells. The data consist of blood samples collected between 1985 and 1987 from 264 Hiroshima individuals for whom DS86 maternal uterine dose estimates are available: 124 proximally exposed (74 males and 50 females) with an estimated dose of 0.005 Sv or more, and 140 distally exposed (76 males and 64 females) with a dose estimate of 0 Sv, assuming the neutron relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 10. A main feature of aneuploidy was that aneuploid frequency in autosomes depended generally on chromosome length; aneuploidies were significantly more frequent in shorter chromosomes than in longer chromosomes. The frequency of aneuploidies also depended on type, with chromosome loss approximately five times more frequent than chromosome gain. However, chromosome 21, as well as the sex chromosomes, were notable in that aneuploidy was much more frequent for these chromosomes than would be predicted from a simple relationship with length. X chromosome aneuploidies were significantly more frequent in females than in males. There was no dependence of aneuploid frequencies on dose when measured 40 years after the exposure.",Immunology

7497444,"Analysis of microsatellite repeats in pediatric brain tumors. Tumorigenesis has been shown to proceed through a series of genetic alterations involving protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. However, investigation of genomic instability of microsatellites has disclosed a new mechanism for human carcinogenesis, which is involved not only in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) but also in a number of other malignancies. To determine whether microsatellite instability is involved in pediatric brain tumors, we screened 15 such tumors using seven microsatellite marker loci on six chromosomes 4, 5, 9p, 9q, 11, 14, and 17. Using the polymerase chain reaction method, DNA samples from the tumors and from normal peripheral blood leukocytes from each patient were compared for the allelic pattern produced at each locus. Our preliminary results indicate loss of heterozygosity at the fatty acid binding protein (FABP) locus, located on chromosomal arm 4q28-q31, the only trinucleotide repeat in the panel of markers used, for 3 of 15 cases, suggesting the presence of previously unidentified sequences relevant to brain tumorigenesis at or in the vicinity of this locus. We did not observe any microsatellite instability in these samples, indicating that the mechanisms operating in HNPCC are not active in this subset of pediatric brain tumors.",Immunology

Cells expressing a recombinant human voltage-activated potassium channel (K-channel), Kv1.5, have been used in a functional assay that measures depolarization-stimulated 86Rb+ efflux as an indicator of K-channel function. Neither untransfected nor vector-transfected cells display measurable 86Rb+ efflux under depolarizing conditions. The depolarization-induced 86Rb+ efflux is blocked by standard K-channel blockers quinine, 4-aminopyridine and 3,4-diaminopyridine, but not by tetraethylammonium, quinidine, glibenclamide, or several peptide toxins. The pharmacological profile of the recombinant system reflects that reported for the channel in its native state. In such a system with no observable endogenous background, analysis of recombinant K-channel subtypes allows rapid assessment of pharmacological agents with isoform selectivity and specificity. Inclusion of compounds of unknown activity in an assay such as this could identify agents capable of modulating specific K-channel isoforms. Development of this high through-put assay system for the study of specific isoforms is a critical step in the identification and development of drugs that affect the desired target tissues with predictable pharmacology and minimal side effects due to nonselective K-channel interaction.",Immunology

Expression of the cellular adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin and PECAM in human kidney allografts was assessed by immunoperoxidase labelling of cryostat sections. Biopsies from 10 kidneys immediately prior to transplantation and 58 biopsies from 51 kidney transplants with graft dysfunction were studied. Allograft dysfunction was due to acute tubular necrosis (n = 5), acute rejection (n = 30), cyclosporin A (CyA) nephrotoxicity (n = 6), acute pyelonephritis (n = 3), recurrent glomerulonephritis (n = 4) and chronic rejection (n = 10). There was variability in the distribution of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin expression in pretransplant kidneys but the principal observation was a marked increase in the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 by the renal vasculature and the proximal tubules during acute rejection. By contrast, grafts with dysfunction not attributed to rejection showed a pattern of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression similar to that observed prior to transplantation. E-selectin was expressed only weakly by occasional intertubular capillaries during acute rejection but the three grafts with pyelonephritis displayed strong expression of E-selectin on intertubular capillaries. There was no change in the pattern of PECAM expression following transplantation. The induction of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 during rejection may contribute to the recruitment of mononuclear cells and render endothelial and tubular renal cells more susceptible to cell-mediated injury.",Immunology

The effect of H2O2 and catalase on isolated rat cerebellum nitric oxide (NO) synthase activity was determined by measuring the conversion of L-[3H]arginine to L-[3H]citrulline. H2O2 (1-5 mM) markedly increased NO synthase activity in the presence of endogenous catalase (72 +/- 4 U/mL). This effect of H2O2 was further increased by exogenous catalase (200 U/mL). Exogenous catalase (0.1 to 1000 U/mL) by itself had no significant effect on NO synthase activity. Nitroblue tetrazolium chloride, an electron acceptor, inhibited NO synthase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. This study suggests that H2O2 is not directly involved in NO synthesis and that the H2O2/catalase stimulation of NO synthase activity may be due to the excess oxygen produced by the H2O2/catalase system.",Immunology
7519697,"Vascular renin-angiotensin system and sympathetic nervous system activity in human hypertension. Experimental data indicate the existence of a vascular tissue renin-angiotensin system in several different vessels from various animal models. Active renin can be locally synthesized into the vessel wall or taken up from circulating plasma to produce vascular angiotensin II. Using the human forearm technique, we produced evidence indicating the release of active and inactive renin and of angiotensin II from the vessels of hypertensive patients. Moreover, the production of vascular angiotensin II seems to be strictly correlated to the circulating renin profile, suggesting the possibility that vascular renin might be at least partially taken up from plasma. To investigate a possible function of the vascular renin-angiotensin system, we studied its interaction with sympathetic neurotransmission in essential hypertensive patients. In line with animal studies, vascular angiotensin II increases the vasoconstriction induced by the stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system through the potentiation of noradrenaline release at a presynaptic level, and this effect seems to be mediated by beta-adrenoceptor activation. This facilitating effect on sympathetic neurotransmission exerted by vascular angiotensin II can be antagonized by both angiotensin II antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.",Immunology

Interspecies somatic cell hybrids were generated by fusing the mouse T-lymphoma cell line, BW5147, with normal human T lymphocytes at different stages of differentiation. Thymocytes, activated peripheral T lymphocytes, or an activated T-cell clone were used as human partners, respectively, in three independent fusions. Irrespective of the human cell partner used for fusion, a certain number of hybrids lost CD5 surface expression over a period of time in culture. Analysis at the phenotype and genetic level showed that lack of CD5 expression was due neither to segregation of human autosome 11, on which the CD5 gene has been mapped, nor to deletion of the CD5 structural gene. Furthermore, loss of CD5 surface expression correlated with the absence of specific mRNA. Since these hybrids preferentially segregate human chromosomes, these results indicate the existence of a non-syntenic trans-active locus, or loci, positively controlling the expression of the human CD5 gene.",Immunology

Estrogens stimulate proliferation and squamous differentiation, whereas progesterone redirects differentiation to a mucus-secreting epithelium formed by goblet-like cells. In the present study, we used monospecific keratin antibodies to show the expression and distribution of keratins in SENCAR mouse vaginal epithelium in different stages of the estral cycle and in ovariectomized animals. In ovariectomized animals, the vaginal epithelium expressed K6, K8, K13 and K14, but not K1. After estrogen treatment, K1 was expressed. During proestrus and estrus, the keratin pattern was essentially identical to that observed in 17 beta-estradiol-stimulated animals. In contrast, during the progestational stages (metaestrus and diestrus) or after progesterone treatment of ovariectomized mice, the most relevant change was the loss of K1. Together, these results show that K1 expression is induced by estrogens in the vaginal epithelium.

Vasoconstrictor responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and the 5-HT1D receptor agonist sumatriptan were studied in isolated bovine pulmonary artery rings. The effects of the antagonists, ketanserin (5-HT2A-receptors) and methiothepin (5-HT1- and 5-HT2A-receptors) on these responses were determined. The influences of vascular tone and the effect of removal of the vascular endothelium and pretreatment with the inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, N omega-nitro-L-arginine methylester, were also studied. In the absence of tone, in the majority of vessels, sumatriptan did not induce significant contractions. 5-HT-induced responses were concentration-dependent and ketanserin and methiothepin antagonized these in a competitive fashion. Removal of the endothelium or inclusion of L-NAME potentiated responses to sumatriptan. The sensitivity to sumatriptan was increased by L-NAME only in the presence of the endothelium whilst maximum responses to sumatriptan were potentiated in both unrubbed and rubbed vessels. Removal of the endothelium and/or inclusion of L-NAME had no significant effect on responses to 5-HT. U46619-induced tone markedly increased sumatriptan-induced responses which were competitively antagonized by methiothepin but were relatively resistant to ketanserin, verifying activation of a 5-HT1D receptor. Responses to 5-HT were also potentiated and competitively antagonized by ketanserin, and further antagonized by methiothepin.

Regulation of the activity of src-family kinases is thought to occur, in part, through the phosphorylation of conserved carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues. Although the src-family includes several molecules with tissue or cell-type restricted expression, the only kinase implicated in the regulatory phosphorylation of these enzymes is p50csk. Herein we report the molecular cloning of a tissue specific p50csk-related gene. Like p50csk, the deduced protein sequence of this novel cDNA includes a tyrosine kinase catalytic domain, SH2 and SH3 domains, a short amino terminus, and no autophosphorylation or carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues. Additionally, neither this novel kinase nor p50csk contain the amino-terminal myristoylation site characteristic of the src-family. However, whereas csk is ubiquitously expressed, mRNA corresponding to this novel gene is expressed in brain, natural killer (NK) cells, and activated T cells but not in a variety of other tissues and cell lines. In agreement with the mRNA expression pattern, antiserum reactive with the predicted carboxyl-terminus of the cDNA recognizes a 57 kDa polypeptide in immunoblots of NK cells and PHA-activated T cells. Because of its limited expression and high homology to p50csk, we named this gene lsk; leukocyte carboxyl-terminal src kinase related gene.

We are developing methods for somatic-cell gene therapy directed against infection with human immunodeficiency virus, by enhancing antiviral resistance of target cells through the constitutive production of autocrine interferon (IFN). Using the human IFN-beta coding sequence under the constitutive low-expression control of a 0.6-kb murine H-2Kb promoter-fragment, we have constructed a retroviral vector, HMB-KbHuIFN beta, and have transformed cells of the T98G human neuroblastoma line, the U-937 human promonocytic line, and the CEM human lymphocytic line. These human IFN-beta-transformed cell populations have acquired a low, constitutive production of human IFN, while replicating at a rate similar to that of untransformed cells and of cells transformed with the control vector carrying a human IFN-beta sequence encoding an inactive, mutated protein. In the three different cell populations tested, transformation with the HMB-KbHuIFN beta vector resulted in a 1.3-2.3 log10 reduction in the number of cells infected with a defective amphotropic MFG-LaZ retrovirus. A kinetic study of the fate of the MFG-LacZ retrovirus in the culture medium and intracellularly immediately after exposure of the cells to virus revealed a significant reduction of the appearance of intracellular virus in human IFN-beta-transformed cells. A similar effect was obtained by treating untransformed T98G, U-937, and CEM cells with exogenous human IFN-beta. The blocking effect of autocrine or exogenous human IFN-beta on viral entry was not limited to virus specific for the amphotropic receptor but was also obtained in murine IFN-beta-treated NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts infected with an ecotropic MFG-LacZ retrovirus. Infection of human IFN-beta-transformed CEM cells with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gave comparable results. Immediately following exposure of the cells to human immunodeficiency virus, a kinetic study of the fate of the virus failed to reveal the appearance of intracellular virus and showed that the majority of the input virus remained in the extracellular medium. We conclude that low autocrine IFN-beta synthesis, or exposure of cells to exogenous IFN-beta, prevents virus from getting inside the cells, regardless of the virus receptor involved.",Immunology
7509609,"Functional interactions of galanin and acetylcholine: relevance to memory and Alzheimer's disease. Galanin, a 29-amino acid neuropeptide, is the only peptide known to coexist with acetylcholine in the basal forebrain neurons which degenerate early in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Biochemical and neurophysiological studies demonstrated inhibitory actions of galanin on cholinergic functions. Behavioral investigations found that intracerebrally administered galanin produces deficits on spatial learning and memory tasks in rats. Taken together, the current literature suggests that galanin acts as an inhibitory modulator of acetylcholine in this coexistence. Particularly in the case of Alzheimer's disease, where cholinergic activity is severely compromised, the negative actions of galanin may be particularly deleterious. Recently developed galanin antagonists may provide a novel therapeutic approach toward enhancing memory processes in Alzheimer's disease, by removing the putative inhibitory actions of endogenous galanin on the remaining basal forebrain cholinergic neurons.",Immunology

Our purpose was to determine whether vaginal misoprostol 7 days rather than 3 days after methotrexate injection increases the percent of successful abortions on the day of misoprostol administration. A randomized controlled trial was performed in women requesting an abortion at < or = 56 days' gestation. Eighty-six women were treated with methotrexate 50 mg/m2 intramuscularly followed 3 days (group 1) or 7 days (group 2) later by vaginal misoprostol 800 micrograms. The misoprostol dose was repeated if the abortion did not occur. Complete abortion occurred in 38 of 46 (83%) patients in group 1 and 39 of 40 (98%) in group 2 (p = 0.033). Of the women with complete abortions, 30 of 46 (65%) in group 1 and 27 of 40 (68%) in group 2 aborted the same day as the first or second dose of misoprostol (p = 0.823). Vaginal bleeding lasted 14 +/- 5 (mean +/- SD) days in group 1 and 17 +/- 9 days in group 2. The remaining women aborted after a delay of 24 +/- 6 days in group 1 and 28 +/- 13 days in group 2. For these women vaginal bleeding lasted 18 +/- 17 and 14 +/- 7 days, respectively, and the human chorionic gonadotropin-beta level was < or = 25 IU/L by 22 +/- 7 days after the abortion in group 1 and 19 +/- 9 days in group 2. Treatment failures in group 1 were four continuing pregnancies (9%), two incomplete abortions (4%), and two women who requested surgical termination after receiving both medications (4%). The treatment failure in group 2 was an incomplete abortion. Methotrexate and misoprostol side effects were infrequent. Methotrexate and vaginal misoprostol are more effective abortifacients when the misoprostol is given 7 days rather than 3 days after methotrexate. This treatment regimen may offer an alternative to surgical abortion or the use of antiprogestins and prostaglandin for medical abortion.",Immunology

Application of the Integrated Poverty Measurement Method, explained in the first part of this report, shows a poverty headcount ratio (H) of 70.6% and an extreme poverty H of 44.7%. H turns out higher by the UBN (Unsatisfied Basic Needs) method than by the PLT (Poverty Line plus working time) approach. The poverty gap or poverty intensity (I), is for all poor 0.44 but reaches 0.58 for the extremely poor. Both H and I are substantially higher in the rural than in the urban areas. UBN poverty gap is bigger than the PLT gap. When UBN is disaggregated into its components, deprivation turns out the highest in health care and social security. Degree of poverty calculations (HI), the product of H and I, which constitute a good basis for anti-poverty expenditures allocation, show that despite the fact that a larger number of poor persons live in the urban areas, the number of equivalent poor people is higher in the rural areas.",Immunology
7502137,"Laparoscopic discectomy with anterior lumbar interbody fusion. A preliminary review. Patients presenting with L5-S1 anterior column disease with or without herniation into the spinal canal but without stenosis underwent magnetic resonance imaging screening before surgery to determine surgical suitability for laparoscopic anterior lumbar interbody fusion relative to the aortic bifurcation and approach to the disc space. To analyze and evaluate the laparoscopic approach, technique, and benefit of anterior lumbar discectomy and interbody fusion by distraction and compression-loading of autograft only as compared with cage-spacer-enhanced autograft fusion. Advancement in minimally invasive spine surgery techniques has provided options with less morbidity for posterior lumbar procedures. General surgical advancements in laparoscopy and advantages of traditional anterior lumbar interbody fusion, including restoration of disc height and exposure for safe nerve decompression, provided a basis for an integrated procedure that would address anterior column abnormality with low surgical morbidity. Five patients underwent technically successful laparoscopic anterior lumbar interbody fusion with approach to the disc space by an experienced laparoscopic general surgeon. A sixth patient in the study group was unable to undergo laparoscopic fusion because of an iliac vein tear during the surgical approach. After the approach, a spine surgeon followed with complete manual discectomy and interbody autogenous fusion laparoscopically. Two to three Cloward-type dowels were obtained by separate incision from the anterior iliac crest. All patients by 6-month follow-up examination were clinically fused with no motion on flexion-extension radiographs. One patient had slight anterior retropulsion of one dowel without the necessity of reoperation. Laparoscopic L5-S1 anterior lumbar interbody arthrodesis may represent a viable option for patients with abnormality, including anterior column and degenerative disc disease.",Immunology
7501471,"Two group I introns with a C.G basepair at the 5' splice-site instead of the very highly conserved U.G basepair: is selection post-translational?. In virtually all of the 200 group I introns sequenced thus far, the specificity of 5' splice-site cleavage is determined by a basepair between a uracil base at the end of the 5' exon and a guanine in an intron guide sequence which pairs with the nucleotides flanking the splice-site. It has been reported that two introns in the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene of Aspergillus nidulans and Podospora anserina are exceptions to this rule and have a C.G basepair in this position. We have confirmed the initial reports and shown for one of them that RNA editing does not convert the C to a U. Both introns autocatalytically cleave the 5' splice-site. Mutation of the C to U in one intron reduces the requirement for Mg2+ and leads to an increase in the rate of cleavage. As the C base encodes a highly conserved amino acid, we propose that it is selected post-translationally at the level of protein function, despite its inferior splicing activity.",Immunology

We have now investigated the methylation sensitivity of BsoFI by testing its activity on plasmid DNA 5'-CG-3' methylated with the M.SssI DNA methyltransferase or on synthetic (CGG)n repetitive oligodeoxyribonucleotides which have been partly or completely C methylated. The data demonstrate that BsoFI cannot cleave at its recognition sequence when it is completely 5'-CG-3' methylated.

The changes in the visceral phospholipid spectrum during chronic stress were found to be phasic, which appeared as significant increases in parameters under study within the first fortnight and their drastic drop at month 2 of stress. The time course of changes occurring in the phospholipid spectrum was held to be associated with adaptive and maladaptive phases of chronic stress. Unlike the viscera, the brain and erythrocytes showed no substantial changes in the major phospholipid fractions during chronic stress. The findings are regarded as evidence for the change-over of carbohydrate oxidation to lipid oxidation in the viscera during chronic stress, but not in the brain and erythrocytes.",Immunology

SPf66 produced in Colombia was more immunogenic than SPf66 produced in the USA and a 1.0 mg dose of each vaccine gave higher antibody levels than a 0.5 mg dose. However, antibody levels fell rapidly after administration of the third dose of vaccine and showed little change over the following malaria transmission season. The incidence of clinical malaria was higher among children who received SPf66 than among children who received inactivated polio vaccine, the effect being most marked among children who received 1.0 mg Colombian SPf66.

At micromolar concentrations, bisG10, added on the intracellular side, induced a strong, reversible, flickery block of KATP channels. BisG10, added on the extracellular side, was about 100-fold less potent at inhibiting channel activity. At 10 nM, intracellular bisG10 increased KATP channel activity. This activation was independent of the presence of internal ATP or Mg2+. The inhibitory effect of bisG10 most likely arose from open-channel block whereas activation could result from more complex, indirect interactions.",Immunology

This study was undertaken to examine whether gamma delta T cells derived from cerebrospinal fluid and blood of MS patients could be stimulated by bacterial superantigens: staphylococcal enterotoxins A and B and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. A panel of 16 gamma delta T cell clones isolated from MS patients and controls was found to react with the superantigens used at a nanogram range and displayed specific cytotoxic activity toward target cells pulsed with the corresponding superantigens. The responses of the gamma delta T cell clones did not require MHC-matched accessory cells and were not blocked by antibodies to the MHC molecules, suggesting a non-MHC restricted interaction.

7488868,Incidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in hypothyroidism. In 13 consecutive severely hypothyroid patients no sign of endocrine cardiomyopathy in the form of asymmetric septal hypertrophy (ASH) could be disclosed by M-mode and two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography on examination prior to thyroxine replacement therapy. In previous investigations ASH was demonstrated to be almost invariably present in untreated hypothyroidism irrespective of thyrotropin levels. Consequently application of positive inotropic and afterload reducing agents that may invoke deleterious effects in ASH has been considered hazardous in hypothyroidism even when indicated by concurrent other heart disease. Determination of exact confidence limits reveals that the proportional incidence of hypothyroid hypertrophic cardiomyopathy could not exceed 24.7% with 95% probability. We conclude that ASH is not necessarily inherent in hypothyroidism.,Immunology

The properties and function of Ca(2+)-activated K+ (KCa) and voltage-dependent K+ (IK) currents of rabbit coronary myocytes were studied under whole cell voltage-clamp conditions (22 degrees C). Inhibition of KCa by tetraethylammonium chloride (1-10 mM) or charybdotoxin (50-100 nM) suppressed noisy outward rectifying current elicited by 5-s voltage steps or ramp at potentials > 0 mV, reduced the hump of the biphasic ramp current-voltage relation, and shifted by less than +5 mV the potential at which no net steady-state current is recorded (Enet; index of resting membrane potential). Inhibition of steady-state inward Ca2+ currents [ICa(L)] by nifedipine (1 microM) displaced Enet by -11 mV. Analysis of steady-state voltage dependence of IK supported the existence of a ""window"" current between -50 and 0 mV. 4-Aminopyridine (2 mM) blocked a noninactivating component of IK evoked between -30 and -40 mV, abolished the hump current during ramps, and shifted Enet by more than +15 mV; hump current persisted during 2-min ramp depolarizations and peaked near the maximum overlap of the steady-state activation and inactivation curves of IK (about -22 mV). A threefold rise in extracellular Ca2+ concentration (1.8-5.4 mM) enhanced time-dependent outward K+ current (6.7-fold at +40 mV) and shifted Enet by -30 mV. It is concluded that, under steady-state conditions, IK and ICa(L) play a major role in regulating resting membrane potential at a physiological level of intracellular Ca2+ concentration, with a minor contribution from KCa. However, elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration enhances KCa and hyperpolarizes the myocyte to limit Ca2+ entry through ICa(L).",Immunology
7503979,"Cyclic AMP stimulates efflux of intracellular sterol from cholesterol-loaded cells. The interaction of high density lipoprotein with its putative receptor stimulates translocation and efflux of intracellular sterols by a process involving activation of protein kinase C. This study shows that activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase also stimulates efflux of intracellular sterols. When intracellular sterol pools of cholesterol-loaded cultured human skin fibroblasts and bovine aortic endothelial cells were radiolabeled with the biosynthetic precursor [3H]mevalonolactone, high density lipoprotein3 (HDL3)-mediated 3H-sterol efflux was enhanced by addition of the adenylylcyclase activator forskolin, the phosphodiesterase inhibitors theophylline and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and the cAMP analogues N6-benzoyl-cAMP (N6-cAMP) and 8-thiomethyl-cAMP. The effect of N6-cAMP was abolished by an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (H8). The enhanced sterol efflux was independent of receptor binding of HDL3, as similar effects were observed in the presence of tetranitromethane-modified HDL3, which lacks receptor binding activity. N6-cAMP stimulated efflux of several subspecies of newly synthesized sterols, including cholesterol. Elevation of cAMP levels increased the proportion of radiosterols that were accessible to treatment of cells with the enzyme cholesterol oxidase, suggesting that activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase stimulates translocation of sterols from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane where they desorb from the cell surface. Thus, at least two distinct protein kinase signalling pathways modulate transport of intracellular sterols in cholesterol-loaded cells.",Immunology

A new screening method for inducers of colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) was established using KM-102, a human bone marrow stromal cell line as the producer. In this method, the assay system which uses CSF dependent cell lines is combined with the CSF production system. Interleukin-1 (IL-1), which is known to upregulate CSF production in many cell populations, was used as a positive control for production of granulocyte CSF (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF). Induction in the positive controls was clearly detected within 24 hours. Activators of protein kinase C (PKC), protein phosphatase inhibitors and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were positive in this assay system, but muramyl dipeptide (MDP) and Bestatin which are known macrophage activators, were negative. Inducers of CSFs were successfully detected using this assay method. Among 1,600 microbial strains tested, 2 actinomycete strains were found to produce active substances. One strain produces teleocidin-A, a strong activator of PKC, and the other strain produces a mixture of active compounds including three novel compounds. These three compounds do not induce terminal differentiation of HL-60 cells, suggesting that they are not teleocidin-like substances and form a new class of CSF inducers.",Immunology

Relationships to intracellular peroxides, protein kinase C translocation, and connexin 43 phosphorylation. The naturally occurring antioxidant boldine and its di-methoxy analogue glucine, as well as the drug antioxidant probucol, all inhibit TPA-induced downregulation of gap junctional intercellular communication in WB-F344 rat liver epithelial cells in dose-dependent manners. The compounds were essentially 100% inhibitory to the effect of TPA (10 nM) at 50 microM each. Analysis of the mechanism of the antitumor promotive action of these agents in vitro revealed that boldine and probucol (both at 10 microM) totally inhibited the TPA-induced accumulation of intracellular oxidants. Additionally, boldine, glaucine, and probucol, each at 50 microM, inhibited TPA-induced translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) to the particulate fraction of the cells, with concomitant inhibition of TPA-induced hyperphosphorylation of gap junctional connexin 43 (cx43) and TPA-induced internalisation of cx43 protein from the plasma membrane of the cells. None of the compounds inhibited the binding of (3H)-PDBu to TPA-specific binding sites in the cells. The results indicate that antioxidant molecules, irrespective of structure, possess common antitumor promotive potential in this model of gap junctional intercellular communication. The data also indicate that the compounds may interfere with the promotive function of TPA, at least in part, by the destruction of oxidants within the cells. Xanthine oxidase was excluded as a major source of such intracellular oxidants because allopurinol (50 microM) did not significantly affect either the accumulation of oxidants in the cells or the downregulation of gap junctional communication in response to TPA. Taken together, these data also suggest that TPA-induced oxidants play a role in the translocation of PKC to cellular membranes and it is at this level where the antioxidants may interfere in TPA-induced downregulation of gap junctional function.",Immunology

The cell receptor binding site was assigned to the preS1 (20-47 aa) fragment. In order to obtain a large quantity of preS1 binding domains of HBV the expression vector pWX4 was constructed. It contains four tandemly joined DNA sequences, each coding for preS1 (20-49 aa), fused with the 3' end of a DNA fragment coding for 450 aa of beta-galactosidase. E. coli cells transformed with this vector produce fusion protein beta-gal-preSlx4 in the form of inclusion bodies.

Molecular mimicry has been characterized as the presence of common epitopes, either linear or conformational, shared by host and microbial determinants. Such cross-reactivity may lead to an autoimmune disease. On the other hand molecular mimicry between certain viral proteins and host determinant may protect invading virus to be eliminated by immune system and may promote persistence. In this mini-review I discuss the molecular mimicry of S peplomer protein of mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM (MHV-JHM) to the host Fc gamma receptor (Fc gamma R). MHV-JHM induces in rodents acute encephalomyelitis and surviving animals develop demyelinating disease with concomitant persistent infection. We have demonstrated that rabbit IgG, but not is F(ab')2 fragments, monoclonal rat and mouse IgG and the rat 2.4G2 anti-Fc gamma R mab immunoprecipitated natural and recombinant S peplomer protein of several strains of MHV. Furthermore, MHV-JHM infected cells formed rosettes with anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) - antibody coated SRBC. The 2.4G2 anti-Fc gamma R mab are able to neutralize several strains of MHV, presumably by binding to S peplomer protein. Therefore, the Fc binding site of S is present on the surface of MHV-infected cells. This molecular mimicry between S peplomer protein of MHV-JHM and Fc gamma R has been extended to other members of Coronaviridae, namely bovine coronavirus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus but not to infectious bronchitis virus.

In the other three cadavers, leads placed by currently accepted techniques of subclavian venipuncture were all found to pass through the soft tissues of the subclavicular region before entering the venous system. Cineradiographic results from a patient with a defibrillator, taken before and after replacement of a broken lead, show the effect of clavicular motion on a lead that passes through the MSMC. Furthermore, cineradiography makes it possible to identify the point where the lead entered the vein, and whether or not it escaped being caught up in the soft tissues of the MSMC.",Immunology
7479058,"Aberrant pre-mRNA maturation is caused by LINE insertions into introns of the white gene of Drosophila melanogaster. Insertional mutagenesis screens have provided thousands of mutant alleles for analysing genes of varied functions in Drosophila melanogaster. We here document mechanisms of insertional mutagenesis by a LINE element, the I factor, by determining the molecular structure of RNAs produced from two alleles of the white gene of D.melanogaster, wIR1 and wIR6. These alleles result from insertion of the I factor into introns of the gene. We show that sequences present within the element direct aberrant splicing and termination events. When the I factor is inserted within the white first intron it may lead to the use of a cryptic 3' splice site which does not contain the dinucleotide AG. This splicing gives rise to a chimeric messenger RNA whose synthesis is controlled differently in tissues where the mutated gene is expressed. When the I factor is inserted within the white last intron it induces synthesis of truncated mRNAs. These results provide, for the first time, mechanisms for I factor insertional mutagenesis. They are discussed in the more general context of RNA processing in Drosophila and the evolution of eukaryotic gene introns.",Immunology

A polyglutamine expansion (encoded by a CAG repeat) in specific proteins causes neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease (HD) and four other disorders, by an unknown mechanism thought to involve gain of function or toxicity of the mutated protein. The pathological threshold is 37-40 glutamines in three of these diseases, whereas the corresponding normal proteins contain polymorphic repeats of up to about 35 glutamines. The age of onset of clinical manifestations is inversely correlated to the length of the polyglutamine expansion. Here we report the characterization of a monoclonal antibody that selectively recognizes polyglutamine expansion in the proteins implicated in HD and in spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 1 and 3. The intensity of signal depends on the length of the polyglutamine expansion, and the antibody also detects specific pathological proteins expected to contain such expansion, in SCA2 and in autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia with retinal degeneration, whose genes have not yet been identified.",Immunology

The Syk cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase has two amino-terminal SH2 domains and a carboxy-terminal catalytic domain. Syk, and its close relative ZAP-70, are apparently pivotal in coupling antigen- and Fc-receptors to downstream signalling events. Syk associates with activated Fc receptors, the T cell receptor complex and the B-cell antigen-receptor complex (BCR) in immature and mature B lymphocytes. On receptor activation, the tandem SH2 domains of Syk bind dual phosphotyrosine sites in the conserved ITAM motifs of receptor signalling chains, such as the immunoglobulin alpha and beta-chains of the BCR, leading to Syk activation. Here we have investigated Syk function in vivo by generating a mouse strain with a targeted mutation in the syk gene. Homozygous syk mutants suffered severe haemorrhaging as embryos and died perinatally, indicating that Syk has a critical role in maintaining vascular integrity or in wound healing during embryogenesis. Analysis of syk-/- lymphoid cells showed that the syk mutation impaired the differentiation of B-lineage cells, apparently by disrupting signalling from the pre-BCR complex and thereby preventing the clonal expansion, and further maturation, of pre-B cells.",Immunology
7477347,"Specificity of monosynaptic connections from thalamus to visual cortex. In cortical area 17 of the cat, simple receptive fields are arranged in elongated subregions that respond best to bright (on) or dark (off) oriented contours, whereas the receptive fields of their thalamic inputs have a concentric on and off organization. This dramatic transformation suggests that there are specific rules governing the connections made between thalamic and cortical neurons (see ref. 4). Here we report a study of these rules in which we recorded from thalamic (lateral geniculate nucleus; LGN) and cortical neurons simultaneously and related their receptive fields to their connectivity, as measured by cross-correlation analysis. The probability of finding a monosynaptic connection was high when a geniculate receptive field was superimposed anywhere over an elongated simple-cell subregion of the same signature (on or off). However, 'inappropriate' connections from geniculate cells of the opposite receptive field signature were extremely rare. Together, these findings imply that the outline of the elongated, simple receptive field, and thus of cortical orientation selectivity, is laid down at the level of the first synapse from the thalamic afferents.",Immunology

Synaptic plasticity dependent on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors is thought to underlie certain types of learning and memory. In support of this, both hippocampal long-term potentiation and spatial learning in a watermaze are impaired by blocking NMDA receptors with a selective antagonist D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP5) or by a mutation in one of the receptor subunits. Here we report, however, that the AP5-induced learning deficit can be almost completely prevented if rats are pretrained in a different watermaze before administration of the drug. This is not because of stimulus generalization, and occurs despite learning of the second task remaining hippocampus dependent. An AP5-induced learning deficit is, however, still seen if the animals are pretrained using a non-spatial task. Thus, despite its procedural simplicity, the watermaze may involve multiple cognitive processes with distinct pharmacological properties; although required for some component of spatial learning, NMDA receptors may not be required for encoding the spatial representation of a specific environment.",Immunology

We have reported previously that methoxyacetaldehyde (MALD), a metabolite of 2-methoxyethanol, induces gpt gene mutations in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-AS52 cells but not hprt gene mutations in the standard CHO-K1-BH4 cells. In addition, MALD induces chromosome aberrations in both CHO cell lines. The data presented suggest that MALD induces deletion-type mutations. In this study, we analyzed MALD-induced CHO-AS52 mutants for deletion-type mutations using the nested-polymerase chain reaction (nested-PCR) assay. Spontaneous CHO-AS52 mutants are used as untreated control. Ethylnitrosourea (ENU)-induced CHO-AS52 mutants are used as negative control for multilocus deletions since ENU is a potent inducer of point mutations. The results show that the frequency of MALD-induced mutants containing total deletion of the gpt gene is 42.4% which is 2.3-fold higher than that from spontaneous mutants (18.6%). The frequency of ENU-induced deletion mutation is 3%. The data substantiate our hypothesis that MALD induces major deletion mutations.",Immunology

The conformations of two backbone-cyclized substance P analogs as derived from 1H NMR and molecular dynamics simulations carried out in DMSO and water are described. The method of floating chiralities is used in the simulations to facilitate the diastereotopic assignment of methylene protons. One of the analogs, cyclo-[-(CH2)3-NH-CO-(CH2)4-Arg-Phe-Phe-N-]-CH2-CO-Leu-Met-NH2, is a highly active, selective agonist for the NK-receptor, while the other, cyclo[-(CH2)2-NH-CO-(CH2)2-Gly-Arg-Phe-Phe-N-]-CH2-CO-Leu-Met-NH2, is inactive. Both analogs contain cyclic ring systems of the same size, varying in only the number of amide linkages. From the conformational analysis, the lack of activity can be attributed to the introduction of too much constraint into the ring system. This has an effect on the topological array of the important residues Arg-Phe-Phe. The results presented here are compared with biologically active analogs previously examined. The differences between conformations of active and inactive compounds are used to develop insight into the conformational requirements for biological activity.",Immunology
7518381,"Effects of fibroblast growth factor on type I 5'-deiodinase in FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells. In the present study, we used FRTL-5 cells to study the effects of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) on 5'-deiodinase (5'D) activity and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. In FRTL-5 cells deprived of TSH for 7 days, type I 5'-deiodinase (5'D-I) activity decreased to low, but detectable levels. Incubation of cells with acidic and basic FGFs significantly decreased 5'D-I activity below the basal levels. After 7 days of TSH deprivation, the addition of TSH (100 microU/ml) to the medium for 3 days resulted in an increase in 5'D-I activity. This TSH-induced increase in 5'D-I activity was blocked by the FGFs in a dose-dependent manner. Kinetic analysis revealed that both acidic and basic FGFs decreased the maximum velocity of 5'D-I activity in the presence or absence of TSH, without any significant effect on the Km of enzyme binding. HPLC analysis of the products of the 5'D-I assay revealed that there was no sequential deiodination of rT3. Incubation of FRTL-5 cells with acidic or basic FGF did not affect basal cAMP concentrations, nor did they block the TSH-induced rise in cAMP. However, acidic and basic FGFs inhibited forskolin- and (Bu)2cAMP-induced increases in 5'D-I activity. Incubation of FRTL-5 cells with TSH, (Bu)2cAMP, and forskolin increased 5'D-I mRNA levels. Incubation of FRTL-5 cells with acidic and basic FGFs decreased steady state 5'D-I mRNA levels and blocked the TSH-, forskolin-, and (Bu)2cAMP-induced increases in 5'D-I mRNA. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that FGFs inhibit 5'D-I activity and mRNA levels in FRTL-5 cells in the presence or absence of TSH. The inhibitory effect of FGFs on 5'D-I in FRTL-5 cells is mediated through either a cAMP-independent pathway or pathways distal to the generation of cAMP. The present data together with the identification of FGF in the thyroid gland suggest that FGF may play a physiological role in the regulation of thyroid hormone secretion.",Immunology

While much emphasis has been placed on the role of MHC class I-restricted CD8+ T cells in the recognition of tumor-specific antigens (Ag), evidence has accumulated that CD4+ T cells also play a critical role in the anti-tumor immune response. However, little information exists on the nature of MHC class II-restricted human tumor Ag. In an attempt to develop in vitro systems to characterize such Ag, we examined the ability of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cells to present melanoma-associated Ag to melanoma-specific CD4+ cells. CD4+ T cells cultured from lymphocytes infiltrating a s.c. melanoma metastasis secreted TNF-alpha and GM-CSF specifically in response to autologous cultured melanoma cells expressing MHC class II molecules. These CD4+ cells also recognized MHC class II-compatible EBV-B cells pulsed with extracts of autologous melanoma cells, but failed to recognize EBV-B cells pulsed with autologous non-transformed cells or a variety of allogeneic tumors or normal cells. B cells pre-fixed with paraformaldehyde were incapable of Ag presentation, suggesting that intracellular processing events were occurring. Antibody-blocking studies defined HLA-DR as the dominant if not exclusive restriction locus in this T-B interaction, and HLA-DR genotyping revealed DRBI*0404 to be the probable restriction element. In a second patient, a CD4+ T-cell clone cultured from a melanoma lesion recognized autologous tumor Ag presented by autologous EBV-B; no corss-reactivity was observed with the other tumor system investigated, nor with autologous CD4+ T cells specific for tetanus toxoid. These findings demonstrate that tumor Ag can be processed and presented by EBV-transformed B cells to MHC class II-restricted tumor-specific CD4+ T cells.

7516473,"Disease-activated transcription factor: allergic reactions in human skin cause nuclear translocation of STAT-91 and induce synthesis of keratin K17. Epidermal keratinocytes have important immunologic functions, which is apparent during wound healing, in psoriasis, and in allergic and inflammatory reactions. In these processes, keratinocytes not only produce cytokines and growth factors that attract and affect lymphocytes but also respond to the polypeptide factors produced by the lymphocytes. Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) is one such signaling polypeptide. Its primary molecular effect is activation of specific transcription factors that regulate gene expression in target cells. In this work, we present a molecular mechanism of lymphocyte-keratinocyte signaling in the epidermis. We have induced cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions that are associated with an accumulation of lymphocytes. These resulted in activation and nuclear translocation of STAT-91, the IFN-gamma-activated transcription factor, in keratinocytes in vivo and subsequent induction of transcription of keratin K17. Within the promoter of the K17 keratin gene, we have identified and characterized a site that confers the responsiveness to IFN-gamma and that binds the transcription factor STAT-91. Other keratin gene promoters tested were not induced by IFN-gamma. These results characterize at the molecular level a signaling pathway produced by the infiltration of lymphocytes in skin and resulting in the specific alteration of gene expression in keratinocytes.",Immunology

Coxsackie B viruses are thought to be involved in the induction of myocarditis. However, the diagnosis of acute infections by serology even today is practically impossible. The major problem is that no antigenic determinants of coxsackie B viruses have been identified or characterized which could be used as antigens in a rapid routine antibody screening test. Therefore, we synthesized overlapping peptides according to the sequence of the capsid protein VP1 of coxsackie B3 (CB3) virus in order to identify antigenic determinants located on VP1. Using sera raised against CB3 in mice, we were able to identify several antigenic determinants of CB3. Here we present a characterization of three epitopes found. We also tested the type-specificity of these antigenic determinants by using rabbit antisera against coxsackie viruses B1-B6. One antigenic determinant, peptide VP1-1, representing residues 1-15 of VP1, reacted highly type-specific for CB3. A second antigenic determinant (peptide VP1-3, residues 21-35 of VP1) reacted as well with the anti-CB3 sera as with the anti-CB4 sera. Therefore, the peptide VP1-3 seems to represent a non-type-specific antigenic determinant of coxsackie B viruses. Peptide VP1-24 (residues 229-243 of VP1) showed broad cross-reaction with anti-CB sera except with the anti-CB1 sera. This identification of type-specific and non-type-specific epitopes of coxsackie B viruses may provide the basis for the establishment of an effective and fast antibody screening test for coxsackie B viruses in patients with clinically suspected myocarditis.",Immunology

Survival times were not significantly prolonged and lasted 1-27 months (median, 11 months), but the quality of life was improved due to preservation or restoration of natural laryngopharyngeal functions. Forty-two patients were operated with curative intention. This group primarily underwent transoral laser microsurgery, aiming at complete locoregional tumor resection with function preservation (pT1, 5; pT2, 31; pT3, 4; pT4, 2).

7513295,"Absence of FMR-1 gene expression can be detected with RNA extracted from dried blood specimens. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by abnormal function of the FMR-1 gene. The majority of fragile X syndrome patients carry an expansion of the CGG tri-nucleotide repeat in the FMR-1 gene, whereas others have a deletion or a point mutation in the FMR-1 structural gene. In this report, we analyzed a typical family with three male patients. RNA from Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphoblastoid cells was used for RNase protection assay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Five normal individuals and one asymptomatic heterozygote from this family expressed detectable FMR-1 transcripts, whereas three fragile X patients showed no sign of expression with either assay. To extend the application of this PCR-based assay to laboratory diagnosis of fragile X syndrome, we confirmed that dried blood samples collected on screening filter papers for newborns are an adequate source of RNA for RT-PCR. Moreover, fragile X patients from the study family and another family were reliably identified by the absence of the FMR-1-specific PCR product from the dried blood specimens. Our studies indicate that this simple assay can be used to diagnose the fragile X syndrome for the majority of male patients.",Immunology
7512556,"Defective asialoglycoprotein receptor endocytosis mediated by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Requirement for a tyrosine in the receptor internalization signal. Regulated endocytosis by growth factor receptors requires intact receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity. To determine whether a similar requirement exists for the asialoglycoprotein (ASGP) receptor which lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and participates in constitutive endocytosis, we examined the effect of three tyrosine kinase inhibitors, tyrphostin, genistein, and staurosporine, on receptor-mediated endocytosis in the human hepatoma line HepG2. These compounds inhibited early receptor internalization from the plasma membrane to internal protease-resistant sites in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect correlated with their inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of the ASGP receptor in vitro. Receptor trafficking subsequent to receptor internalization was unaffected. Endocytosis of another constitutively internalized protein, the transferrin receptor, was also inhibited by these compounds. In contrast, pinocytosis of the fluid-phase marker Lucifer yellow was not inhibited. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors also decreased the endocytic rate of transfected ASGP receptor H1 subunit in SK-Hep-1 cells. Therefore an intact ASGP receptor heterooligomeric complex is not required for this effect. Mutation of the single cytoplasmic tyrosine at position 5 of the H1 subunit to phenylalanine produced an ASGP receptor which was endocytosed regardless of treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We conclude that tyrosine kinase activity modulates the rate of receptor endocytosis at a point early in the internalization process.",Immunology

7511231,"Conductive property of the zone of slow conduction of reentrant ventricular tachycardia and its relation to pacing induced terminability. In order to assess the functional characteristics of the zone of slow conduction of reentrant VT, rapid pacing was performed to entrain VT. The orthodromic conduction time was measured as the interval between the stimulus and the orthodromically captured electrogram recorded distal to the zone of slow conduction, but not precisely at the exit point, and its response to rapid pacing was evaluated. In 32 of 33 consecutive patients, rapid pacing was performed to entrain VT. Of these, rapid pacing was repeated in 28 patients at 3-10 cycle lengths in steps of 10 msec before VT was terminated, or rapid pacing produced an acceleration of the rate. A pacing induced prolongation of the orthodromic conduction time (slowed conduction) was observed in 16 (57.1%) patients and in another 12 (42.9%) patients, the conduction time was constant. The pacing induced termination was observed in 93.8% of VT with slowed conduction and in 50% of VT with constant conduction, and the difference was significant (P < 0.05). There was no difference in the cycle length of VT or the shortest paced cycle length between VT with and without slowed conduction. The zone of slow conduction in human VT showed different conductive properties and VT with slowed conduction was associated with an easier and safer terminability with rapid pacing. The fact might be useful in selecting patients for antitachycardia pacing.",Immunology
7510317,"Nitric oxide synthase in motor neurons after axotomy. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS), an enzyme involved in synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), has been localized in many diverse cell types. In the CNS and PNS, discrete neuron cell groups express NOS constitutively. Recent evidence indicates that NOS is inducible in neurons normally not expressing NOS. After transection of peripheral nerves, NOS expression was significantly up-regulated in the axotomized sensory ganglion cells, whereas in the corresponding motor neurons NOS was not induced unless axon regeneration was prevented and ensuing neuron death became massive. Studies on axotomy-induced NOS have been limited largely to spinal nerves, with only one reported in the vagus nerve. The aim of this study was to determine whether NOS induction in motor neurons of the brainstem after axotomy is regulated in a manner similar to that of the spinal cord. By NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry and NOS immunocytochemistry, the status of NOS in neurons of the hypoglossal nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and motor nucleus of the facial nerve was examined 2 weeks after unilateral transection of the respective cranial nerves, and the results were compared with those of spinal motor neurons after transection of the sciatic nerve. NOS, undetectable in neurons of the three cranial motor nuclei of sham-operated animals, was observed in about 30-50% of neurons in the cranial motor nuclei ipsilateral to axotomy, but it was not detected in spinal motor neurons after axotomy. NOS localized in axotomized cranial motor neurons was unrelated to NOS of macrophages or endothelial cells. There was no appreciable cell loss from axotomy at this period except in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, where some loss was observed. The results indicate that there is a fundamental difference in the regulation of NOS expression between motor neurons of the cranial and spinal nerves. The possible role of NOS/NO acting as cytoprotective or cytotoxic agent on injured motor neurons is discussed. Motor neurons of cranial and spinal nerves may serve as a useful model to further define the roles of NOS/NO in neurons, especially after traumatic injury.",Immunology
7510290,"Functional characterization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in apical membranes purified from bovine tracheal epithelium. Inside-out apical membrane vesicles were isolated from bovine tracheal epithelium. They were enriched 13- and 18-fold in two apical membrane markers, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase, respectively, and presented a low level of contamination by basolateral and intracellular membranes. These apical membrane vesicles of homogeneous inside-out orientation were used to measure 36Cl- influx. The 36Cl- influx was found to be (i) voltage-insensitive (ii) diphenylcarboxylic acid-insensitive, and (iii) from 55 to 100% activated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase according to initial rates and accumulation capacities. This rapid and ATP-dependent activation was associated with phosphorylation of a 170-180-kDa protein but was not observed with a nonhydrolyzable nucleotide like adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). Immunodetection experiments showed that the mature form of bovine cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) was only present in the apical membranes. As compared with the previously described characteristics of CFTR, the 36Cl- uptakes detected here are the in vitro manifestation of the functional form of bovine CFTR located at the apical level in these tracheal epithelial cells. Inside-out apical membrane vesicles, with freely accessible cytoplasmic sides and functional CFTR, offer a new model system to study CFTR.",Immunology

First, from an experiment comparing Sendai virus with influenza virus it appears that the nature of the antigen as well as host-parasite interactions may play an important role in efficiency of oral immunization. Second, oral immunization with an inactivated virus can apparently induce a cell-mediated immune response. Preliminary evidence (not shown) indicated that the magnitude of effector cell killing versus virus-infected target cells was positively influenced by including cholera toxin in the oral immunization regimen. This is consistent with a recent report that cholera toxin could enhance T cell proliferative response to co-fed KLH.

7500134,"Responses of cells in the tail of the caudate nucleus during visual discrimination learning. 1. The tail of the caudate nucleus and adjacent ventral putamen (ventrocaudal neostriatum) are major projection sites of the extrastriate visual cortex. Visual information is then relayed, directly or indirectly, to a variety of structures with motor functions. To test for a role of the ventrocaudal neostriatum in stimulus-response association learning, or habit formation, neuronal responses were recorded while monkeys performed a visual discrimination task. Additional data were collected from cells in cortical area TF, which serve as a comparison and control for the caudate data. 2. Two monkeys were trained to perform an asymmetrically reinforced go-no go visual discrimination. The stimuli were complex colored patterns, randomly assigned to be either positive or negative. The monkey was rewarded with juice for releasing a bar when a positive stimulus was presented, whereas a negative stimulus signaled that no reward was available and that the monkey should withhold its response. Neuronal responses were recorded both while the monkey performed the task with previously learned stimuli and while it learned the task with new stimuli. In some cases, responses were recorded during reversal learning. 3. There was no evidence that cells in the ventrocaudal neostriatum were influenced by the reward contingencies of the task. Cells did not fire preferentially to the onset of either positive or negative stimuli; neither did cells fire in response to the reward itself or in association with the motor response of the monkey. Only visual responses were apparent. 4. The visual properties of cells in these structures resembled those of cells in some of the cortical areas projecting to them. Most cells responded selectively to different visual stimuli. The degree of stimulus selectivity was assessed with discriminant analysis and was found to be quantitatively similar to that of inferior temporal cells tested with similar stimuli. Likewise, like inferior temporal cells, many cells in the ventrocaudal neostriatum had large, bilateral receptive fields. Some cells had ""doughnut""-shaped receptive fields, with stronger responses in the periphery of both visual fields than at the fovea, similar to the fields of some cells in the superior temporal polysensory area. Although the absence of task-specific responses argues that ventrocaudal neostriatal cells are not themselves the mediators of visual learning in the task employed, their cortical-like visual properties suggest that they might relay visual information important for visuomotor plasticity in other structures.

To identify the representativeness and sensitivity of the data collected by the Australian Capital Territory Injury Surveillance and Prevention Project (ACTISPP) for ED injury cases seen in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). A retrospective descriptive study was conducted using a systematic sample of people injured in the ACT between January 20 and September 19, 1992, and who received their first treatment for this injury in an ACT ED. The ACTISPP surveillance system is dependent on ED patient or family completion and return of a comprehensive injury survey. The following population variables in the ACTISPP database were compared with those of the injured ED population, as determined by ED and hospital record review: age, gender, postal code of residence, nature of injury, body part injured, and whether the patient had been admitted to hospital. The sensitivity of the surveillance system for injuries seen in the ED was 31% (95% CI = 30-32%). The distribution of the ACTISPP sample did not differ from the expected distribution for sex or socioeconomic status. The distributions differed by age only in the 5-14-year age group (p < 0.001). With respect to the nature of injury and body part injured, the difference was significant (p < 0.001) but was no greater than 7% for any of the categories. Two percent of the surveillance sample were admitted to hospital, compared with an estimated 4% of the target population (p < 0.001). Approximately one-third of all incident injuries managed in the EDs of the ACT are included in the ACTISPP database.

Of 116 pregnant patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 or gestational diabetes, 12 (10.3%) had previously suffered stillbirth, while in four (3.4%) cases spontaneous abortion after the 6th month had occurred. In these 16 cases, we examined the mean daily blood glucose concentration, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fructosamine as well as glucose and albumin elimination via urine. These control data on carbohydrate metabolism were correlated with the intensity of gestational monitoring in relation to course of pregnancy and neonatal morbidity and/or mortality. In addition, we retrospectively analyzed the cause of prior intrauterine death. In six of eight cases evaluable, we could hereby demonstrate disturbed carbohydrate metabolism. Pregnant women with diabetes mellitus type 1 were hospitalized twice as often (on average four times) as patients with gestational diabetes (2.1 admissions on average). While five of seven type 1 diabetics were primarily admitted prior to the 20th week of gestation, the majority of gestational diabetics (7/9) were first examined by qualified medical personnel trained in the care of gestational diabetes after the 28th week of gestation. Two of nine were first diagnosed post partum. 13 of 14 patients with prepartally known diabetes demonstrated mean blood glucose values under 110 mg/dl. While one of the two patients with postpartally diagnosed diabetes suffered stillbirth once again, the other had to be delivered by emergency C-section because of fetal distress (pH art. 7.08).

Fetal ventral mesencephalic grafts have been used as a tool to counteract the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. In this study human fetal ventral mesencephalic xenografts were implanted into the lateral ventricle of unilaterally dopamine-depleted immunosuppressed rats. Rotational behavior elicited by low doses of apomorphine, host striatal dopamine receptor binding, and mRNA levels were investigated. Rotational behavior was reduced beginning 2 months after grafting. After 4 months only a small number of rotations, lasting approximately 30 min, were recorded. Seven months after transplantation, the rotational behavior was completely eleminated. Dopamine D2 receptor binding revealed significantly increased levels in sham-operated 6-hydroxydopamine- (6-OHDA) lesioned control striata. These increased levels decreased, and although still significantly higher at 4 months, normalized at the survival time of 7 months postgrafting. Regional differences were still obvious at 7 months in the dorsolateral quadrant of dorsal striatum. Dopamine D2 receptor mRNA revealed significantly increased levels in the lateral aspects of 6-OHDA-lesioned control striata, reversing by 4 months postgrafting. The D1 receptor binding revealed a moderately reduced signal in striata of lesioned animals. After grafting, this reduction became significantly lower than that seen in the control side, with a continous decrease over time. The same pattern was detected using in situ hybridization for dopamine D1 receptor mRNA, that is, moderate decreases after dopamine depletion and a significant decrease in the dorsomedial part of dorsal striatum 7 months postgrafting. Dopamine D3 receptor binding was increased after dopamine depletion, but reversed already by 4 months postgrafting. Taken together, human ventral mesencephalic xenografts are able to completely reverse apomorphine-induced rotational behavior, provided the grafts are left in vivo for a sufficient time. The increased striatal D2 receptors are reversed after grafting, but the human xenograft further suppressed the D1 receptor subtype both at binding and at mRNA levels. There was no strict correlation in the time courses of dopamine receptor changes and reduction of rotational behavior.",Immunology

Analysis of series of ultrathin sections revealed that synaptic profiles with strong immunogold reactions for GABA usually also displayed strong immunogold reactions for glycine. Pre-embedding immunocytochemistry was performed on sections containing labelled cells with a monoclonal antibody which recognises the glycine receptor-associated protein, gephyrin. Many synapses onto postsynaptic dorsal column neurons were associated with gephyrin-like immunoreactivity and these typically contained irregularly shaped vesicles. Immunogold reactions showed that synaptic profiles apposed to gephyrin-immunoreactive junctions contained GABA and glycine. The evidence suggests that glycine is a neurotransmitter at synapses on spinomedullary neurons and that it is colocalized with GABA.",Immunology

Memory-guided saccades, made to a remembered location to which gaze was directed before a passive body rotation (i.e. with a vestibular input), were electro-oculographically recorded in 24 patients with various cortical lesions and in 18 control subjects. Anticipation and latency, direction errors and accuracy of the first saccade, stability of eye position in darkness and final eye position were quantified. Patients were divided into small groups, each with lesions affecting one of the following cortical areas: left or right frontal eye field (FEF), left or right prefrontal cortex (area 46 of Brodmann) (PFC), left supplementary eye field (SEF), left or right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and right parieto-temporal cortex (PTC). There were some abnormalities in the results of the right FEF group, concerning anticipation, direction errors and latency of the first saccade, but no abnormality in the accuracy of the first saccade or of the final eye position. Results in the left FEF group were normal. Accuracy of the first saccade was impaired in the SEF group, bilaterally. Final eye position was also inaccurate in the SEF group. In both PFC groups, significant and, in general, bilateral abnormalities existed for all tested parameters. Accuracy of the first saccade was impaired in the PTC group, leftwards. In contrast, the results in both PPC groups were not significantly different from those of control subjects. Our results suggest that (i) the PFC is involved in the memorization of saccade goals probably encoded in spatiotopic coordinates; (ii) the SEF, but not the FEF, is involved in the control of accuracy of these vestibular-derived goal-directed saccades; (iii) the PTC (i.e. the vestibular cortex), but not the PPC, is involved in the control of such saccades. Therefore, a cortical network different from that involved in the control of memory-guided saccades made to visual targets, with only the PFC in common, could control vestibular-derived goal-directed saccades.",Immunology

The detection of horizontal angular displacement of the head or trunk was assessed in 13 normal subjects and three labyrinthine defective patients. Discrete rotational displacements to the whole body (vestibular stimulus, VS), the trunk whilst keeping the head earth-stationary (cervical stimulus, CS) or the head upon the stationary trunk (combined VS+CS in passive and active mode) were delivered. Amplitudes ranged from 10 degrees to 40 degrees with peak velocities from 5 degrees to 40 degrees/s. Response was quantified as saccadic gain (final position of the eye/amplitude of the rotational stimulus) in a 'remembered saccade' task. it was found that normal subjects show different accuracy according to the sensory channel investigated. If stimulus amplitude was limited (20-30 degrees), gain dropped as rotational velocity decreased during VS but not in conditions including cervical stimulation (CS or VS+CS). Responses combining cervical and vestibular stimuli (VS+CS) were closer to unity gain and showed less scatter than isolated VS and CS. In the labyrinthine-defective patients, VS yielded no structured response but all responses involving cervical stimulation were identical to those of normal subjects when analysed both as a function of stimulus amplitude and velocity. Neither in normal nor in labyrinthine-defective subjects were there significant differences in the ability to detect head angular displacement between passive or active head turns (passive or active VS+CS). The following conclusions can be made. (i) 'Remembered saccade' techniques can be used to investigate cervico-vestibular perception. (ii) The 'high pass' characteristic of the response during VS agrees with the dynamic sensitivity of the vestibular nerve signals. Cervical experiments confirmed that neck responses are position-driven (i.e. 'tonic'). (iii) The detection of head turns is only slightly more accurate when vestibular and cervical signals are combined, but the main input controlling this perception is provided by neck afferents. No specific function for 'efference copy' was apparent in these experiments. (iv) There is no significant change for detecting head turns (on the trunk) in labyrinthine-defective patients. (v) The lack of detectable changes in cervical tasks in labyrinthine-defective patients does not support the view that the potentiation of the cervico-ocular reflex (COR) observed in these patients is due to enhanced sensitivity of the neck afferent system.",Immunology

Overall, both the intraoperative time and postoperative recovery period were reported as significantly reduced when blepharoplasty is performed by laser as compared with scalpel. In general, the incidences of edema, ecchymosis, and postoperative pain were reported as less severe with laser. No serious complications related to the laser were documented by the survey responders.

This paper outlines some of the theoretical and practical developments being made in neurofuzzy systems. As the name suggests, neurofuzzy networks were developed by fusing the ideas that originated in the fields of neural and fuzzy systems. A neurofuzzy network attempts to combine the transparent, linguistic, symbolic representation associated with fuzzy logic with the architecture and learning rules commonly used in neural networks. These hybrid structures have both a qualitative and a quantitative interpretation and can overcome some of the difficulties associated with solely neural algorithms which can usually be regarded as black box mappings, and with fuzzy systems where few modelling and learning theories existed. Both B-spline and Gaussian Radial Basis Function networks can be regarded as neurofuzzy systems and soft inductive learning algorithms can be used to extract unknown, qualitative information about the relationships contained in the training data. In a similar manner, qualitative rules or information about the network's structure can be used to initialise the system. These areas, coupled with the extensive work being carried out on theoretically analysing their modelling, convergence and stability properties means that this research topic is highly applicable in ""intelligent"" modelling and control problems. Apart from outlining this work, the paper also discusses a wide variety of open research questions and suggests areas where new efforts may be fruitfully applied.",Immunology

Analysis of leukemia-specific and leukemia-associated markers following standard or high-dose treatments is crucial in order to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic strategies.

Each approach is characterized by advantages and limitations, mainly related to its sensitivity and specificity. The general limitations of such tests originates from the size of the sample which can be analysed and the heterogeneous distribution of leukemia after treatment. Clinically useful methods for detecting residual leukemia require not only sensitivity but also speed and reproducibility. The rate of false negative tests is low with polymerase chain reaction as well as flow cytometric analysis. Usually, patients without persistent cells carrying leukemia-associated markers have a lower risk of relapse. However, the detection of a persistent marker at one time point in complete remission cannot be considered a reliable indicator of MRD, whereas increase of positive signals or reappearance of leukemic markers usually precedes relapse. It is likely that one single approach will not allow the monitoring of the majority of patients and that a combination of techniques will be needed. Definitive results will be obtained only through prospective studies in patients receiving standardised therapy. Studies in which therapeutic strategies are designed according to the results provided by techniques for detecting MRD will be necessary to assess the relevance of their contribution to the treatment of leukemia.",Immunology
7496347,"Recommended procedures for the classification of acute leukaemias. The classification of acute leukaemias is now widely based on a combined morphological, cytochemical and immunophenotyping approach. Difficulties are frequently encountered however in reaching an acceptable degree of diagnostic concordance between different laboratories because of variations in the techniques used (in terms of methodologies, reagents and equipment) and diagnostic interpretation. The International Council for Standardization in Haematology (ICSH) convened an expert panel to consider currently available diagnostic techniques with the aim of defining a minimum cytochemical and immunological diagnostic panel that could be used as core components for the classification of acute leukaemia. The proposed ICSH scheme, which attempts to balance the basic requirement for providing precise and informative diagnostic information without limiting its use to only those laboratories with sophisticated facilities, is based on three sequential levels of investigation; primary cytochemistry, intracellular phenotyping and membrane immunophenotyping. The minimum ICSH recommended cytochemistries comprise myeloperoxidase (MPO), chloroacetate esterase (ChlorE) and alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE), and standardised methods for these cytochemistries are detailed in this communication. For cases of acute leukaemia that remain unclassified by primary cytochemistry, subsequent immunological analyses for cytoplasmic CD3, CD22, MPO and nuclear TdT are recommended. The ICSH panel considers that the use of these minimum primary cytochemical and intracellular phenotyping procedures will lead to the consistent classification of most acute leukaemias, and that the third level of investigation (membrane immunophenotyping) should be used for the purposes of confirmation, diagnostic clarification of atypical leukaemias, and the subtyping of acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL). The ICSH panel also recognised that there are a number of additional technologies which can provide definitive diagnostic information, such as cytogenetics and DNA genotyping, but these were excluded from the minimum panel because of their restricted availability. While many specialised laboratories, particularly in the areas of diagnostic research, will continue to use individual investigatory protocols, it is considered that the inclusion of the ICSH scheme as core components would lead to greater consistency when comparing independent studies of acute leukaemia.",Immunology
7496338,"Retinal hemodynamics in patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma. Recently it has been demonstrated that retinal hemodynamics are disturbed in patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma. As the underlying cause a reduction in perfusion pressure due to increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and deficiencies of retinal autoregulation has been discussed. The present study was undertaken to clarify the influence of filtering surgery on retinal hemodynamics in patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma. A total of 17 patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma aged between 37 and 86 years were included in this prospective study. All patients underwent digital fluorescein angiography before and 10 days after fistulating procedures. From the angiograms the arteriovenous passage time (AVP) and arterial mean dye-bolus velocity (MDV) were quantified by means of digital picture analysis. At baseline the AVP was significantly prolonged in the patients as compared with reference values (AVP, 2.5 +/- 0.8 versus 1.6 +/- 0.4 s; P < 0.01). After the fistulating procedure (IOP: before, 29 +/- 5 mmHg; after, 16 +/- 4 mmHg) the AVP was significantly reduced as compared with baseline values (AVP, 2.5 +/- 0.8 versus 2.0 +/- 0.4 s; P < 0.05), whereas the MDV showed only a slight increase (MDV, 5.70 +/- 0.89 versus 5.99 +/- 0.92 mm/s; P > 0.05). This study confirms a disturbance of retinal hemodynamics in patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma. The significant reduction in AVP observed after lowering of the IOP by fistulating procedures demonstrates the positive influence of IOP reduction on the retinal circulation. The improvement in retinal circulation may prevent the occurrence of further glaucomatous damage after fistulating procedures.",Immunology

7496240,Income distribution and life expectancy: a critical appraisal. In a series of papers published during the past decade Richard Wilkinson has advanced the view that income inequality is the key determinant of variations in average life expectancy at birth among developed countries. Yet a careful examination of the two sources of data on income distribution most often used by Wilkinson suggests that if they are analysed more appropriately they do not lend support to his claims. More recent data on income distribution is now available for several countries in the Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation in the mid-1980s and for Great Britain from 1961 to 1991. The use of these data also casts doubt on the hypothesis that inequalities in the distribution of income are closely associated with variations in average life expectancy at birth among the richest nations of the world.,Immunology
7496174,"Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia with ragged-red fibers: clinical, morphological and genetic investigations in 43 patients. The evaluation of the severity of progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) with ragged-red fibers in muscle, at the onset of the disease, when PEO is most often the only presenting symptom, is a difficult problem in neurological practice. In order to address that issue, we have performed a comparative analysis of the clinical, morphological and molecular characteristics of 43 patients affected with that form of ocular myopathy. Quantification of mitochondrial accumulation was performed with an image analysis application on muscle sections stained with succinate dehydrogenase histochemical reaction. The proportion of muscle fibres appearing as cytochrome c oxidase deficient was used as an index of the muscle-energy defect. Muscle mitochondrial DNA deletions were detected, localized and quantitated by Southern blot analysis. Point mutations were screened in five transfer RNA genes in the mtDNA (tRNA(Leucine (UUR)), tRNA(Lysine), tRNA(Glutamine), tRNA(Isoleucine) and tRNA(Formylmethionine)) by a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technique. This investigation confirmed the high frequency of mtDNA deletions or point mutations in PEO. At the onset of the disease, no clinical, morphological or molecular features could predict whether PEO would remain isolated or become part of a more severe multisystem disease. However, patients with mtDNA deletions were characterized by more severe ophthalmoplegia of earlier onset. Their muscle alterations were roughly parallel in severity to the proportion of deleted mtDNA molecules in muscle. Patients with a multitissular disease and mtDNA deletions were always sporadic cases and their clinical presentation was, most often, closely related to Kearns Sayre syndrome.",Immunology
7496172,"Lecithinized superoxide dismutase retards wobbler mouse motoneuron disease. Gene mutations of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) have been discovered in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Oxidative stress also plays a role in the pathogenesis of sporadic ALS. Whether antioxidant therapy is beneficial in this fatal disease is now crucial. We have shown that SOD treatment improves neuromuscular dysfunction and morphological changes in wobbler mouse motoneuron disease. Progressive spinal motor neuronopathy and axonopathy, predominantly in the cervical cord, occur at postnatal age 3-4 weeks, leading to muscle weakness and contracture of the forelimbs in this animal. These motor deficits rapidly increase by postnatal age 6-8 weeks, and then slowly progress. Wobbler mice were given two doses daily of phosphatidyl choline-bound Cu/Zn SOD (PC-SOD, 10(4), 10(5) U/kg) or a vehicle solution by intraperitoneal injection from postnatal 3-4 to postnatal 7-8 weeks of age. PC-SOD treatment attenuated progression of motor dysfunction, prevented denervation muscle atrophy, and delayed degeneration of spinal motoneurons in wobbler mice. This raises the possibility that PC-SOD may have therapeutic potential in human motoneuron disease.",Immunology

Since cytotoxic chemotherapy (BCNU, DTIC and cisplatin, tamoxifen) and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) have each produced responses in advanced malignant melanoma, a phase II trial was conducted to evaluate the response and toxicity of simultaneous administration of both therapies. Of 33 assessable patients, two (6%) had complete response (CR) and 12 patients (36%) had partial response (PR), for a total response rate (CR+PR) of 42% (95% confidence interval 26-58). Four patients had minor response (12%). Mixed responses occurred in five patients (15%). The remaining patients had progressive disease. The duration of CR was 3, 7 and 17 (+) months and the duration of PR was 3+ to 19+ months (median 6 months). The median overall survival for all patients entered into the study was 5 months. Main toxicities included myelosuppression and fatigue. Combined simultaneous cytotoxic chemotherapy and IFN produced a high response rate (42%) which is comparable to that reported for chemotherapy alone. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal schedule for combining chemotherapy and immunotherapeutic agents as well as the impact of biological agents on survival in the treatment of melanoma.",Immunology

Cytotoxicity of the mistletoe lectins I, II and III towards six human breast cancer cell lines was assessed using the Mossman assay. In addition, binding of the three mistletoe lectins to the separated membrane glycoproteins of these cell lines, the binding and uptake of these lectins into the cells in tissue culture and the binding of the lectins to histological preparations of these cell lines were analysed. The results indicate that there are quantitative differences concerning the toxicity of these three lectins towards the different cell lines. Furthermore, the lectin binding pattern in the cell lines differed. In Western blots, several membrane glycoproteins were labelled by the lectins. Our results indicate subtle differences between the three lectins with regard to the parameters mentioned above; however, the toxicity of all three lectins from mistletoe is so similar that they all seem suitable for the construction of immunotoxins.",Immunology

Fifteen samples of non-tumoural breast tissue, 24 cases of benign lesions, four biopsies of inflammatory carcinomas and 94 tumour samples of primitive mammary carcinomas were analysed for HLA class II expression. We found, first, that HLA class II antigens were detectable in all cases of non-neoplastic breast tissue. Secondly, HLA class II antigen expression was notably increased in benign neoplasms and hyperplastic lesions. In contrast, only 32 out of 94 carcinomas showed expression of HLA-DR antigens, 17 tumours had HLA-DP antigens and 11 carcinomas were positive for the presence of DQ molecules. The expression of class II antigen was associated with the degree of histological differentiation (P < 0.05) but was independent of stromal leucocytic infiltration. Thirdly, HLA-DR was very strongly expressed in intravascular tumoural thrombi, especially in the 'inflammatory carcinomas'. The immunophenotype of inflammatory infiltrate was analysed in benign and malignant lesions. In malignant lesions the mean number of inflammatory cells was significantly higher than in benign lesions. Interestingly, we found no differences in the amount and composition of inflammatory infiltrate between HLA-DR positive and negative tumours.",Immunology

Interferon is the only established treatment for chronic hepatitis C but the host-dependent or virus-related factors affecting the response rate to interferon therapy are not yet clear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors predictive of response to interferon-alfa therapy in chronic hepatitis C. Twenty-five consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis C were randomized to three regimens of interferon-alfa: group A (n = 7, 3 MU every day for 3 months), group B (n = 8, 3 MU every other day for 3 months) and group C (n = 10, 3 MU every other day for 6 months). We quantified serum HC RNA levels by competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and performed HCV genotyping using type-specific primers deduced form the NS5 region of the HCV genome. We also attempted to identify which demographic, biochemical and histologic factors in addition to virus-related factors would significantly predict beneficial response to interferon by multivariate analysis. Sustained responders were 8 (36.4%), nonsustained responders were 2 (9.1%) and nonresponders were 12 (54.5%) of 22 patients who had received complete therapy. The initial HCV RNA level (logarithmic transformed copy numbers per ml of serum) in sustained responders (5.75 +/- 0.39) was significantly lower than that of nonsustained responders (6.80 +/- 0.71) and nonresponders (6.70 +/- 0.52) (p < 0.05). In multivariate multiple logistic regression analysis, the serum HCV RNA level before therapy was only the independent predictor of a sustained response to interferon-alfa therapy (p = 0.001). Serum HCV RNA level before therapy was the most useful predictor of a sustained response to interferon-alfa therapy for chronic hepatitis C.",Immunology

Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), an agent that provides symptomatic relief in patients with interstitial cystitis (IC) works via an unknown mechanism. We investigated whether DMSO acts as a chemical stimulant of mast cell degranulation. A radioimmunoassay (RIA) specific for histamine was used to test this hypothesis. Twelve women with strictly diagnosed IC were treated with intravesical instillations of DMSO. Treatments were repeated at varying intervals, and each patient received three to six treatments. Urine histamine levels were measured before and after each intravesical instillation of DMSO. Dilutional effects of DMSO were corrected for by conversion of urine histamine concentration to urine histamine:creatinine ratio. The RIA was unaffected by the addition of DMSO to urine. No consistent change in the urine histamine:creatinine ratio following DMSO instillation was found. Trend analysis revealed no trend in the histamine:creatinine ratio with time. The relief of symptoms reported in 50% to 77% of patients treated with intravesical DMSO is not related to detectable mast cell release of histamine. Other mechanisms of action must be investigated to explain the beneficial effect of this agent.",Immunology
7495099,"Treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin induces a moderate rise in hematocrit and thrombin antithrombin in healthy subjects. Recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) therapy in uremic patients raises the hematocrit (Hct) and increases physical exercise capacity (1,2) and quality of life (1). In general, partial correction of anemia to subnormal levels in uremic patients has proven to be safe with few serious adverse effects apart from hypertension (3). Ever since the advent of EPO the prospect of abuse of the hormone by sportsmen has been subject to scrutiny. Both maximal oxygen uptake and endurance capacity are increased after EPO treatment in healthy subjects (4). Moreover, EPO treatment in healthy subjects has been found to induce an accentuated blood pressure reaction after submaximal exercise (5). Previous studies have shown that extreme physical exertion can predispose to an increased intravascular coagulation (6). Moreover there is a significantly increased risk of thrombosis in patients with myeloproliferative disorders, particularly in polycythemia vera (7). An enhanced risk of cardiovascular events may therefore arise should sportsmen abuse EPO as a blood doping agent. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of an EPO-induced increase in Hct on the coagulation system in healthy subjects.",Immunology

The objective was to prepare polymeric microparticles by atomizing organic polymer solutions into a spray chamber containing compressed CO2 (PCA-process) and to study the influence of various process parameters on their morphological characteristics. The swelling of various pharmaceutically acceptable polymers [ethyl cellulose, poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(epsilon-caprolactone), poly(dl-lactide), poly(l-lactide) and poly(dl-lactide-glycolide) copolymers] in CO2 was investigated in order to find polymers which did not agglomerate during the spraying process. Poly(l-lactide) (L-PLA) microparticles were prepared by spraying the organic polymer solution into CO2 in a specially designed spraying apparatus. The effect of various process (pressure and temperature of the CO2 phase, flow rate) and formulation (polymer concentration) variables on the morphology and particle size of L-PLA-microparticles was investigated. Polymers with low glass transition temperatures agglomerated even at low temperatures. The formation of microparticles was favored at moderate temperatures, low polymer concentrations, high pressures and high flow rates of CO2. High polymer concentrations and low flow rates resulted in the formation of polymeric fibers. Colloidal L-PLA particles could also be prepared with this technique in a surfactant-free environment. Initial studies on the microencapsulation of drugs resulted in low encapsulation efficiencies. The PCA method is a promising technique for the preparation of drug-containing microparticles. Potential advantages of this method include the flexibility of preparing microparticles of different size and morphology, the elimination of surfactants, the minimization of residual organic solvents, low to moderate processing temperatures and the potential for scale-up.",Immunology

The purpose of this study was to determine the existence of insulin-degrading enzyme (EC 3.4.22.11) (IDE) in rat intestinal enterocytes. Subcellular fractionation, biochemical characterization, immunoprecipitation, and western blots were employed. Insulin-degrading activity was localized in the cytosol, constituting 92% of total insulin-degrading activity. Cytosolic insulin-degrading activity had a pH optimum of 7.5, was almost completely inhibited by IDE inhibitors (N-ethylmaleimide, 1,10-phenanthroline, EDTA, p-chloromercuribenzoate, bacitracin), but was not or only weakly inhibited by others (aprotinin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and diisopropyl phosphofluoridate.) Further, cytosolic insulin-degrading activity had a Km of 78 nM, sharing a similar Km value with insulin-degrading enzyme in non-purified forms. Approximately, 87 +/- 1.7% of cytosolic insulin-degrading activity was removed by the monoclonal antibody to IDE.

The selective effects od dopamine and dobutamine in various doses on liver circulation were studied in 12 mongrel dogs. Dopamine increased portal flow but decreased hepatic arterial flow markedly as infusion rate of dopamine increased. Dopamine 3 micrograms/kg/min infusion rate produced vasodilation in mesenteric vascular bed and the portal flow ratio to cardiac output was significantly increased. Dobutamine increased both portal and hepatic arterial flows at the 5 and 10 micrograms/kg/min dobutamine infusion rates, and decreased hepatic arterial flow at the 15 micrograms/kg/min dobutamine infusion rate. Both dopamine and dobutamine increased total liver flows, however, total liver flow ratio to cardiac output was not increased. Pressure gradient of portal system was not changed during dopamine and dobutamine infusion, since both portal venous pressure and hepatic venous pressure were avariant from control values. These findings suggest that congestive hyperemia was not occurred in intrahepatic portal vascular system when portal flows were increased during dopamine and dobutamine infusion. The results of this study demonstrate that both dopamine and dobutamine did not produce selective increases in total liver blood flow. In addition, both agents should be safe to use to the normal liver patient; total liver blood flow did not decrease and intrahepatic congestive hyperemia was not occurred when portal flow was increased.",Immunology

Specific pathogen-free birds were inoculated intranasally with one of these viruses. At daily intervals for 7 days and then at 10, 14, and 21 days post-inoculation (PI), two birds from each group were killed and samples of the brain were collected for histopathological and virological examination. Q10 caused severe nonsuppurative encephalitis with nervous signs and high mortality. Lesions characterized by neuronal degeneration and necrosis, perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, and focal or diffuse astrogliosis occurred mainly in the parahippocampal cortex, hippocampus, hyperstriatum, neostriatum, subleptomeningeal and periventricular regions of the cerebrum. Spongy changes with neuronal degeneration and axonal spheroids were also observed in the brain stem of a few cases. The amount of virus in the brain reached a peak on day 4 PI and virus could not be recovered from the brain after 6 days PI. In contrast, Q0 caused nonfatal asymptomatic disease and virus could not be isolated from the brain, sections of which showed only minimal inflammatory changes. This difference in the lesions of the brain might be related to neurovirulence and, neuroadaptation by serial passage may occur by increased efficiency of viral replication in neurons.",Immunology

The presence of soman, an irreversible inhibitor of cholinesterase was used to bring to the fore a possible modification of the enzyme behaviour in this system under pressure. Results show differences between enzyme in conventional medium and in reversed micelles regarding the mechanism of BuChE catalyzed hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine. In both systems, the enzyme displays a non-Michaelian behaviour with this substrate. In conventional medium the kinetics is multiphasic with an activation phase followed by an inhibition phase at high concentration. In reversed micelles there is inhibition by excess substrate but the activation phase is missing.

7492592,"Mechanism-based inactivation of porcine kidney diamine oxidase by 1,4-diamino-2-butene. Cis- and trans-1,4-diamino-2-butene are substrates and potent inactivators of porcine kidney diamine oxidase. Evidence from absorption and NMR spectra indicates that both are oxidized to pyrrole. Both substrates are irreversible mechanism-based inactivators of the enzyme, although the trans isomer is more potent and results in complete inactivation in a reaction which follows pseudo-first-order kinetics with an apparent Ki of 0.34 mM and a second-order inactivation constant of 500 M-1 s-1. Under the same conditions, 46% of the activity remains when the enzyme is reacted with cis-1,4-diamino-2-butene. Trans-4-amino-2-butenal, the product of oxidation of the trans diamine, has been synthesized and shown to undergo cyclization to pyrrole in a concentration-dependent manner, approaching second-order at low concentrations. Trans-4-amino-2-butenal is itself a potent irreversible inhibitor with IC50 of 2.5 microM. We propose that the irreversible inactivation by both cis- and trans-1,4-diamino-2-butene involves attack by a protein-based nucleophilic residue on the unsaturated aminoenal products of the enzymatic reactions, resulting in a covalent adduct. Cyclization of the cis-aminoenal to pyrrole is much more rapid than in the trans case, thus it is less available for inhibitory reaction with the protein.",Immunology

Insulin regulates hexose uptake by the redistribution of glucose transport proteins from intracellular compartments to the cell surface. We have submitted the trafficking of GLUT1, GLUT4, and GLUT1/GLUT4 chimeras to a mathematical analysis in the context of different models. Our data suggest that a model with one intracellular and one cell surface compartment can describe the glucose transporter-trafficking kinetics in fibroblasts. Moreover, the difference in cellular distribution between GLUT1 and GLUT4 overexpressed in fibroblasts is best explained by a slower rate of movement of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, glucose transporter-trafficking kinetics is adequately described by a three-pool model which includes flow of transporters from the endosomal compartment to cell surface. The kinetic roles of previously identified motifs in GLUT4 trafficking were defined in proposed fibroblast and adipocyte glucose transporter-trafficking models. The C-terminus is important in reducing the exocytosis rate from the endosomal compartment to the cell surface in both fibroblasts and adipocytes, and the N-terminus behaves similarly in adipocytes. The C-terminus has an additional signal(s) that allows GLUT4 to be sequestered more efficiently into the insulin responsive vesicle compartment. Mutation of the dileucine motif in the C-terminus significantly reduces the endocytosis of GLUT4 in both fibroblasts and adipocytes, but these amino acids appear not to be primarily responsible for the different kinetics of wild-type GLUT1 and GLUT4.",Immunology

The reaction of oxygen with cytochrome bo3, a quinol oxidase from Escherichia coli, has been studied by resonance Raman scattering after initiation of the reaction by CO photolysis in a continuous flow apparatus and by directly mixing the enzyme with oxygen. The high-frequency region of the spectrum was monitored to determine the time evolution of the spin, oxidation, and coordination states of heme O and the oxidation state of heme B by using newly established marker lines for each heme. Three phases of the reaction were detected. In phase I, complete in 75 microseconds, O2 reacted with heme O and formed a low-spin ferric or ferryl adduct without significant oxidation of heme B. In phase II, between 75 and 120 microseconds, a small fraction of heme B was oxidized. In phase III, at approximately 1 s, the majority of heme B was oxidized and heme O reverted to a high-spin ferric state. The high rate of oxygen reduction at heme O to the three- or four-electron reduced level, despite a very low rate of heme B oxidation, indicates that there are electron donors active in the enzyme other than the metal centers. Assays of our enzyme preparations rule out a quinol in the tight binding (QH) site as a possible donor but instead suggest electron donation from the protein matrix, such as from tryptophans or tyrosine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology

Four recombinant fragments, representing different sets of EF-hand motifs of rat calretinin (CR) (I-II, I-III, III-VI, IV-VI), were prepared, and their Ca2+ -induced conformational changes were compared with those of full-length recombinant CR. All fragments were able to bind calcium ions as shown by 45Ca2+ overlay method on nitrocellulose and fluorescence measurements. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence intensity (FI) of apo-CR reversibly increased about 3-fold upon addition of calcium, indicating a change of conformation. The FI of fragments I-II (Trp 25) and I-III (Trp 25 and 116) increased about 1.4-fold on calcium binding, but that of fragment III-VI (Trp 116) increased 3.5-fold. Calcium titration of CR monitored by Trp fluorescence intensity showed that recombinant CR and some fragments bound Ca2+ with high affinity (Kd below 0.4 microM) and with high cooperativity. An apparent Hill coefficient for Ca2+ -induced fluorescence changes in CR was about 3.7. CR bound to organomercurial-agarose Cys 101 and 266 did not form cystine. The fluorescence intensities of cysteine-linked fluorescent probes 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein and N-(1-pyreneiodoacetamide) were increased approximately 1.3-fold upon calcium binding by CR. These data indicate that CR binds Ca2+ with high affinity and cooperativity and that this binding induces a change of conformation that involves the interaction of different parts of the molecule. Taken together, our results suggest that CR works as an on/off switch within a narrow range of free Ca2+ by interacting with as yet unidentified targets.",Immunology

Most (95%) of the displacement errors were less than 10 mm in the frontal portal and less than 15 mm in the lateral portals. No correlation to the patient's weight was found. The displacement errors were randomly distributed. The spatial relations between the implants were not altered during the treatments. Small movements of the prostate were observed. To conclude, the positioning system employed at present (laser) can be sufficient for the margins used (2 cm). In lateral portals, however, the system did not have the ability to detect a possible systematic displacement error from simulator to accelerator. The intention is to decrease the margins to 1 cm, which will necessitate a better positioning system.",Immunology

One hundred fifty-six consecutive patients (96 men and 60 women) aged 16 to 60 years admitted as emergencies after bleeding. Potential risk factors (baseline characteristics, health habits, and clinical variables) for death and impaired outcome were studied prospectively up to 1 year after hemorrhage. One year after hemorrhage, 64 patients (41%) were independent and 34 patients (22%) were dependent in the activities of daily living; 58 patients (37%) had died. Risk of death was predicted, after adjustment for sex, age, hypertension, and body mass index, by clinical condition at admission according to the Glasgow Coma Scale (P < .001) and the occurrence of subcortical hematoma (odds ratio [OR], 0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04 to 0.91; P = .04). Risk of poor outcome (dependent state or death) was predicted, after adjustment for sex, hypertension, body mass index, cigarette smoking, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage, and surgery, significantly by the Glasgow Coma Scale (P < .001); presence of subcortical hematoma (OR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.27; P < .001); volume of hematoma (P = .03); age (P = .004); amount of alcohol consumed within 1 week before hemorrhage (P = .03); and presence of cerebellar hematoma (OR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.95; P = .04). Significant independent predictors of impaired outcome (assessed with the Glasgow Outcome Scale) were the Glasgow Coma Scale (P < .001); presence of subcortical hematoma (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.67; P = .006); alcohol intake within 1 week (P = .002); and presence of cerebellar (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.60; P = .008), intraventricular (OR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.19 to 6.28; P = .02), or caudate hemorrhage (OR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.77; P = .03). The mean erythrocyte corpuscular volume was directly associated with an impaired outcome (P < .05). In addition to severity and location of the hemorrhage, the age of the patient and the amount of alcohol consumed within 1 week seem to be independent determinants of outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage.",Immunology

Myoblast transplantation has been considered a potential treatment for some muscular disorders. It has proven very successful, however, only in immunodeficient or immunosuppressed mice. In this study, myoblasts from C57BL10J +/+ mice were transplanted, with no immunosuppressive treatment, in the tibialis anterior of fully histocompatible but dystrophin-deficient C57BL10J mdx/mdx mice. One to 9 months after transplantation, the success of the graft was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. All the transplanted mice (n = 24) developed dystrophin-positive fibers following transplantation. Depending on myoblast cultures, transplantations, and time of analysis, the mice presented 15 to 80% of dystrophin-positive fibers in transplanted muscles. These fibers were correctly oriented and they were either from donor or hybrid origin. The dystrophin-positive fibers remained stable up to 9 months. Possible humoral and cellular immune responses were investigated after grafting. Antibodies directed against dystrophin and/or muscle membrane were developed by 58% of the mice as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Despite the presence of these antibodies, dystrophin-positive fibers were still present in grafted muscles 9 months after transplantation. Moreover, the muscles did not show massive infiltration by CD4 cells, CD8 cells, or macrophages, as already described in myoblast allotransplantations. This lack of rejection was attributed to the sequestrated nature of dystrophin after fiber formation. These results indicate that myoblast transplantation leads to fiber formation when immunocompetent but fully histocompatible donors and recipients are used and that dystrophin incompatibility alone is not sufficient to induce an immunological rejection reaction.",Immunology

Scatchard analysis of the bindings of mouse 125I-D-factor and human 125I-D-factor to the sD-factor-R indicated dissociation constants (Kd) of 12 and 0.267 nM, respectively, which were comparable to those of the binding protein in mouse serum. The apparent molecular masses of the sD-factor-R and human D-factor observed by gel filtration chromatography were 150 and 50 kDa, respectively. The size of the sD-factor-R.human D-factor complex was approximately 200 kDa, indicating that D-factor forms a 1:1 complex with the sD-factor-R.

7489824,"Heterogeneous response of porcine gonadotrope subpopulations to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) during postnatal development. In previous papers, we showed the porcine gonadotrope population to be composed of three GtH subpopulations that can be separated by density using a continuous Percoll density gradient. We also demonstrated that these subpopulations exhibited different hormonal storage patterns and morphological features during porcine postnatal development at three representative ages: neonates (30 days), prepubers (5-6 months) and matures (16-18 months). In this work, we investigated whether these morphologically heterogeneous subpopulations are also functionally different. Thus, the effect of the hypothalamic gonadotropic hormone-releasing factor (GnRH) on these subpopulations was assessed in order to ascertain whether a mutual relationship between the reported morphological features, hormonal storage patterns and physiological response to the stimulation can be established. For this purpose, gonadotropin secretion was measured by cell immunoblot assay and hormonal content by scanning cytophotometry. Low-density gonadotropes (1.049 g/cm3), present in the three age groups studied, were mainly composed of bihormonal LH/FSH cells in neonates and monohormonal LH cells in prepubers and matures. GnRH stimulation was found to increase both LH and FSH secretion, as well as the intracellular content. These results indicate that GnRH can stimulate both the synthesis and release of both gonadotropins in this subpopulation. Middle-density gonadotropes (1.062 g/cm3), present in prepubers and matures only, were composed of bihormonal cells. GnRH stimulated the secretion of LH and FSH in prepubers and matures, but decreased hormonal contents except that of LH in prepubers. However, GnRH stimulation increased the proportion of immunoreactive gonadotropes (particularly monohormonal cells). Finally, high-density cells (1.087 g/cm3), present in neonates and prepubers only, were mostly composed of bihormonal LH/FSH gonadotropes, and exhibited low (neonates) or no response (prepubers) in terms of LH release and content when treated with GnRH. In conclusion, these results indicate that porcine gonadotrope subpopulations are morphologically and physiologically heterogeneous. The heterogeneity remained through porcine postnatal development, thus suggesting that all the subpopulations are physiologically relevant. However, the different hormonal storage patterns between subsets of the same density suggest age-related differences within each subpopulation due, at least in part, to the different physiological condition of the animals during development.",Immunology
7489334,"Role of nitric oxide in control of growth hormone release in the rat. Previous experiments in this and other laboratories have revealed that nitric oxids (NO) plays a role in controlling the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH). Therefore, we have investigated its role in control of growth hormone (GH) release in conscious rats by microinjecting NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA), an inhibitor of NO synthase (NOS), into the third ventricle (3V) of conscious, freely moving castrate male rats. An initial blood sample (0.3 ml) was drawn from an indwelling intra-atrial catheter just prior to injection of NMMA [1 mg in 5 microliters of 0.9% NaCl (saline)] into the 3V. To maintain the inhibitory action on NOS, a second injection of NMMA was administered into the 3V 60 min after the first. Additional blood samples (0.3 ml) were removed at 10 min intervals for 120 min. Other animals received injections of the diluent at the same times and volumes as NMMA. Interleukin (IL)-1 alpha (0.06 pmol in 2 microliters saline) was injected into the 3V immediately after the first injection of NMMA, whereas other animals received the NMMA diluent followed by IL-1 alpha. The effects of IL-1 alpha were almost identical to those of NMMA in that there was a dramatic lowering of plasma GH achieved primarily by a reduction in height of the GH pulses without a significant reduction in their number.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology

This article reviews the literature and describes risk factors frequently identified in relation to pre-, intra-, and postoperative settings, impact of each risk factor on pulmonary function, and issues related to risk factor evaluation. Eighteen risk factors are reviewed regarding their pathophysiologic impact on pre-, intra-, and postoperative pulmonary function. Key issues related to risk factor evaluation are also discussed. Identification of risk factors and prediction of postoperative pulmonary complications are important.

7488214,"Small pH gradients inhibit cytochrome c oxidase: implications for H+ entry to the binuclear center. Respiring cytochrome c oxidase proteoliposomes generate internal alkalinity (delta pH) and a membrane potential (delta psi). Valinomycin collapses delta psi, increases delta pH, and slows steady state respiration. If delta pH is heterogeneously expressed trapped probes will underestimate it. Internal pH changes were therefore followed in COV containing two buffer systems of differing pKs. The alkalinization rate at pH 7 was unaffected by adding AMPSO (pK 9.0) to the usual internal HEPES (pK 7.5). At higher pH, AMPSO slowed the approach to steady state. delta pH inhibition is therefore not due to a large alkalinization in a small COV fraction. The O2-reducing center may move protons via a local aqueous phase that is near electrical and pH equilibrium with the phase inside the COV. The dielectric in this membrane region can put the center electrically 'inside' even though it is physically 'outside'.",Immunology

In a behavioral model it was also demonstrated that 6-11 are 5-HT2A receptor antagonists. The molecular modelling results suggested that the distances between the basic nitrogen atom and the two aromatic centers (d1 = 5.2-8.4 A, d2 = 5.7-8.5 A, and d3 = 4.6-7.3 A) define the molecular topography of the 5-HT2A receptor antagonists under study.",Immunology

This report deals with the findings of an epidemiological interview carried out among two representative samples (n = 800 + 800) consisting of persons born in 1904-13 and in 1914-23, and living at home in the year 1988 in the city of Jyväskylä, central Finland. The participation rate was 80% (n = 1244). It appeared that overall involvement in physical exercise decreased with increasing age, especially among the women. About 50% of the subjects carried out regular walking exercise and 40% practised some form of home gynastics which was considered not to be very intensive. About 20% of the subjects were no more physically active than was essential for performing their daily activities. According to log-linear and regression models, there was a significant association between higher prevalence of depression and no regular physical exercise. Self-rated meaningfulness of life and better subjective health were also significantly related to regular and intensive physical exercise. These relationships were more obvious among the younger cohort (65-74 years). The results suggest that involvement in physical exercise may promote positive perceptions of psychological well-being among the elderly. On the other hand, psychological well-being seemed to be an important predictor for staying physically active at advanced ages. These findings are based on a cross-sectional study and therefore leave open the question of direction of causality which will be pursued in a follow-up survey.",Immunology

Assessing the adequacy of collateral circulatory pathways has become increasingly important in the investigation of cerebral circulation. Using transorbital Doppler ultrasonography (TOD), we examined the ophthalmic artery (OA) in patients with hemodynamic significant internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusive disease. The velocity and the direction of flow in the OA were studied in 45 patients (occlusion n = 27, stenosis > 75% n = 18), and in 30 age matched controls, under baseline conditions and within 30 minutes after the i.v. administration of 1 g acetazolamide as a vasodilatory stimulus. Based on the direction of flow before and after acetazolamide, the 45 patients could be separated into four groups with increasing degree of ICA lesions. In group I the OA flow was anterograde, but the velocity decreased after acetazolamide. In group II the OA direction became retrograde after acetazolamide, indicating collateral flow to the brain. In patients with retrograde OA flow following acetazolamide injection (group II-IV), the vessel reacted similarly to an intracranial artery, with marked increase in velocity when vasoreactivity was tested. TOD and the acetazolamide test provide useful information about potential collateral OA flow to the brain in patients with ICA occlusive disease.",Immunology
7514872,"Immunocomplexes stimulate different signalling events to chemoattractants in the neutrophil and regulate L-selectin and beta 2-integrin expression differently. Neutrophils express receptors for numerous phlogistons which, when occupied, trigger distinct signal-transduction pathways. Previous studies have shown that stimulation of neutrophils with chemoattractants induces shedding of the adhesive molecule L-selectin and increased expression of the beta 2-integrin CD11b/CD18. We determined the effect of ligation of classic, G-protein-linked chemoattractant receptors [C5a, interleukin-8 (IL-8), formylmethionyl-leucylphenylalanine (FMLP) and substance P], receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (Fc gamma receptors) and receptors for transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) on expression of adhesive molecules by neutrophils and the stimulus-transduction mechanisms thought to mediate these changes. We were surprised to observe that occupancy of Fc gamma receptors by immunocomplexes (BSA-anti-BSA) stimulated increased expression by neutrophils of CD11b/CD18 at concentrations which did not affect L-selectin expression (EC50 9 micrograms/ml versus 350 micrograms/ml respectively, P < 0.00001, n = 5). In contrast, similar to previous studies, recombinant C5a, recombinant IL-8 and FMLP all stimulated increased expression of CD11b/CD18 (170-260% of basal, P < 0.001, n = 5) and shedding of L-selectin (56-75% reduction from basal, P < 0.001, n = 5) at similar concentrations and with similar potencies (EC50 = 2, 5, and 3 nM respectively). In contrast, neither TGF beta 1 nor, surprisingly, substance P affected expression of CD11b/CD18 or L-selectin. The regulation of expression of CD11b/CD18 or L-selectin in response to FMLP or immunocomplexes was unaffected by cytochalasin B (5 micrograms/ml) or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin-25 (25 microM). Although occupancy of both chemoattractant (FMLP) and Fc gamma receptors stimulated increments in the second messenger diacylglycerol, disruption of actin microfilaments by cytochalasin B enhanced diacylglycerol generation in response to FMLP but not in response to ligation of Fc gamma receptors. Moreover, both FMLP and immune aggregates provoked fluxes of intracellular Ca2+ concentration which differed with respect to both magnitude and kinetics and did not correlate well with regulation of adhesive-molecule expression. As upregulation of CD11b/CD18 is tightly linked to exocytosis of specific granules, these results suggest that shedding of L-selectin by activated neutrophils is not linked to exocytosis. These studies provide further evidence that receptors for chemoattractants and immunocomplexes on the neutrophil are linked to multiple signalling pathways.",Immunology

During impotence evaluations a positive intracavernous injection test has been presumed to signify normal erectile hemodynamics. This premise was tested by obtaining hemodynamic data in 80 patients 17 to 65 years old with positive injection tests: patients achieved maximal circumference responses and equilibrium intracavernous pressures of 80 mmHg or more (range 80 to 136) sustained for 30 minutes or longer. Corporeal veno-occlusive testing revealed that flow-to-maintain (0.5 to 3 ml. per minute) and pressure decay (0 to 47 mmHg) values as well as pharmaco-cavernosography findings (absent or minimal contrast medium in venous structures in 92% of the cases) were all consistent with low outflow erection states. Arterial testing revealed right and/or left cavernous systolic arterial blood pressures always at 80 mmHg or more, consistent with a prerequisite cavernous artery pressure value for a positive injection test. Systemic-cavernous systolic arterial blood pressure gradients were 0 to 24 mmHg, 25 to 34 mmHg and 35 mmHg or more in 47 (59%), 18 (22%) and 15 (19%) patients, respectively. Large systemic-cavernous pressure gradients suggested the presence of arterial occlusive disease. In 8 patients with positive injection tests and gradients of 35 mmHg or more pharmaco-arteriography revealed hemodynamically significant arterial occlusions. In conclusion, hemodynamic data in selected patients with positive injection tests revealed low outflow erection states, threshold cavernous artery pressures and disparities in systemic-cavernous systolic pressure gradients that suggested arterial disease in 19% of the cases. The erectile response in a positive test is equal to or greater than a threshold response, not always the maximum response as determined by the systemic blood pressure. A positive intracavernous injection test did not necessarily signify normal erectile hemodynamics.",Immunology

Infiltration of inflammatory cells into joint cavity and histopathological changes in synovial tissue were examined at 7 and 14 days following the start of infusion. The continuous infusion of IL-8 for 14 days led to severe arthritis characterized by apparent erythema and joint pain, the accumulation of leucocytes, infiltration of mononuclear cells in synovial tissue, and marked hypervascularization in the synovial lining layer. IL-8 may be a factor which can contribute to the inflammatory process of chronic arthritis by mediating leucocyte recruitment and hypervascularization in inflamed joints.",Immunology
7511994,"High [Ca2+]o-induced electrical heterogeneity and extrasystolic activity in isolated canine ventricular epicardium. Phase 2 reentry. Elevated intracellular calcium activity is thought to play an important role in arrhythmia induction, particularly during ischemia and reperfusion. Delayed after-depolarization-induced triggered activity and intracellular communication problems are thought to be responsible. Increased extracellular calcium levels and rapid pacing are interventions known to elevate intracellular calcium activity. The present study, conducted using standard microelectrode techniques, was designed to compare the effects of increased [Ca2+]o (1.8 to 5.4 mmol/L) in isolated canine ventricular epicardial and endocardial tissues and to test the hypothesis that elevated intracellular calcium activity contributes to arrhythmogenesis in working ventricular myocardial tissues by promoting electrical heterogeneity. High [Ca2+]o caused a slight abbreviation of action potential duration (APD90) in endocardium but more dramatic rate-dependent and dynamic changes in epicardium. Under steady-state conditions, epicardium displayed a marked abbreviation of APD90 at fast rates but no significant changes at slow rates. A significant augmentation of phase 1 was evident at the faster stimulation rates. Vmax and conduction velocity were only slightly reduced. The marked abbreviation of the epicardial response at the factor rates was due to loss of the action potential dome. Recovery of the dome after deceleration was not synchronous throughout the preparation. As a consequence, a sudden slowing of rate caused marked dispersion of repolarization among neighboring epicardial sites, giving rise to ectopic activity via a phase 2 reentry mechanism. These effects of high [Ca2+]o were mimicked by exposure of the preparations to low [Na+]o. Electrical homogeneity was restored and arrhythmias were abolished after addition of the Ito blocker 4-aminopyridine 1 mmol/L. 4-Aminopyridine also eliminated the differential response of epicardium and endocardium to high [Ca2+]o. Our data demonstrate the induction of marked electrical heterogeneity and reentrant activity by high [Ca2+]o and rapid stimulation, conditions known to elevate [Ca2+]i. The results suggest that increased intracellular calcium activity, as occurs during ischemia and reperfusion, may contribute to the development of electrical inhomogeneity in the ventricle and thus to the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias through a mechanism other than triggered activity, namely, phase 2 reentry. Our data point to an increase in net outward current as the underlying mechanism for the calcium-induced changes. Our results also suggest that the presence of a prominent transient outward current (Ito) in epicardium sensitizes that tissue to the effects of high calcium. Finally, the results suggest that Ito blockers can reverse high calcium-induced electrical heterogeneity and thus can exert antiarrhythmic actions.",Immunology

The localization of CD44 was investigated immunohistochemically in postmortem human brain tissue of control subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease. CD44 is a multifunctional cell surface glycoprotein that serves as a receptor for hyaluronic acid, collagen types I and VI, and mucosal vascular addressin. In gray matter, it was found to be associated with some astrocytes of both protoplasmic and fibrous morphology. These positively stained astrocytes were most frequently observed in association with blood vessels, and had morphologies that were highly comparable to those described with the Golgi technique. Double immunostaining for CD44 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) revealed that a significant number of these astrocytes were positive for both antigens. However, GFAP staining was mostly confined to the cell somata and proximal processes, while CD44 staining extended to a rich and extensive array of processes. Occasional CD44 positive cells of spherical morphology with a few thin varicose processes were observed. Their processes formed thick terminations on blood vessels, suggesting that these cells are a special class of astrocyte. In Alzheimer's disease brain, the number of CD44 positive astrocytes increased dramatically. These data suggest that astrocytes have very extensive branching patterns, which are reflected by CD44 staining patterns.

A range of neuropeptides has been identified in the adrenal glands of many mammalian species. In many cases these peptides have been located in nerves supplying the adrenal cortical cells, or within clusters of chromaffin cells within the zona glomerulosa. The function of these neuropeptides has yet to be determined, but from their location within the gland it is clearly possible that they may have a role in the regulation of aldosterone secretion. The effects of Met-enkephalin, Leu-enkephalin, neuropeptide Y, substance P, corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and neurotensin on aldosterone secretion were investigated using the intact perfused rat adrenal gland in situ. All the peptides tested, except CRH, caused a significant increase in aldosterone secretion over the dose range of 1 pmol to 10nmol, with a maximum response of about a twofold increase in secretion. Met-enkephalin, however, at a dose of 10 nmol caused a 350% increase in aldosterone secretion, a response comparable with that seen in response to angiotensin II in this preparation. These results suggest that, while substance P, neuropeptide Y, neurotensin and Leu-enkephalin all have the capacity to cause modest increases in the rate of steroid secretion by the zona glomerulosa, these neuropeptides probably do not have a major role in the acute regulation of aldosterone secretion, at least under basal conditions. Met-enkephalin, on the other hand, was a more potent stimulus to aldosterone secretion, and thus may have a role in the control of aldosterone secretion.",Immunology
7511093,"Involvement of nitric oxide in the regulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone release from the GT1-1 neuronal cell line. A role for nitric oxide (NO) in the regulation of hypothalamic neurohormone secretion has been suggested. The aim of the present study was to establish a direct involvement of this novel intracellular regulatory molecule in the control of GnRH release. For this purpose, the GT1-1 GnRH-secreting continuous cell line was treated with various agents that can modify the endogenous NO synthase activity or, alternatively, with substances that can liberate NO, mimicking an increased concentration of this molecule in the cell. Treatment of GT1-1 cells with increasing concentrations of L-arginine, the direct precursor of NO, produced a marked reduction of norepinephrine-stimulated GnRH release despite a lack of effect on basal secretion. Similarly, the NO donors SIN-1 and acidified NaNO2 potently reduced basal as well as KCl-stimulated GnRH secretion. Conversely, sodium nitroprusside caused a significant inhibition of KCl-stimulated, but not basal, GnRH secretion. Addition of these agents to GT1-1 cells resulted in a marked increase in intracellular cGMP accumulation. Addition of the NO synthase inhibitors N-nitro-L-arginine and N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester stimulated basal GnRH secretion without modifying norepinephrine- or KCl-stimulated release. In addition, treatment of GT1-1 cells with both L-arginine analogs produced a significant inhibition of the basal cGMP concentration. Together, these data suggest an inhibitory role for NO in the control of GnRH secretion from GT1-1 cells.",Immunology

Human metallothioneins (hMTs) are a family of highly homologous proteins thought to be critical in cellular protection against toxins. The comparative function of individual isoforms is, however, obscure. Antibodies to individual MT isoforms might help clarify this issue but their generation has been challenging. We now describe a strategy that has successfully produced an epitope-specific antiserum to a major human isoform, hMT IIA. The immunogen, a conjugated tridecyl amino acid synthetic peptide unique to residues 8-20 in hMT IIA (AAGDSCTCAGSCK), yielded an antiserum (B2) that reacted specifically with hMT IIA in a concentration- and titer-dependent manner and showed no reactivity with human or rabbit liver MT I or horse MTs. This antiserum recognized rabbit liver MT II and, surprisingly, also reacted weakly with chicken MT. MT amino acid sequence comparisons and peptide blocking studies suggested aspartate-11 and threonine-14 are important antigenic determinants for B2. Using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and B2 antiserum, we observed nuclear localization of hMT IIA with human bladder T24 tumor cells in exponential growth but more cytoplasmic localization at confluence.

7510061,"Toluene embryopathy: delineation of the phenotype and comparison with fetal alcohol syndrome. To determine if maternal toluene abuse produces any structural or developmental disabilities in the developing fetus, a cohort of toluene-exposed infants was ascertained and examined. Eighteen infants with a history of in utero toluene exposure were examined at birth. Nine of these infants were reexamined 3 to 36 months after their initial evaluations. The clinical findings in these patients were compared with those of similarly exposed children from the literature and with patients who had the fetal alcohol syndrome. Thirty-nine percent of all toluene-exposed infants described in this and other studies were born prematurely, and 9% died during the perinatal period. Fifty-four percent were small for gestational age, and 52% exhibited continued postnatal growth deficiency. A 33% incidence of prenatal microcephaly, a 67% incidence of postnatal microcephaly, and an 80% incidence of developmental delay were observed. Eighty-three percent of the patients had craniofacial features similar to the fetal alcohol syndrome, and 89% of these children had other minor anomalies. Data from the patients herein described and the available scientific literature suggest that the mechanism of alcohol craniofacial teratogenesis may be nonspecific, with a variety of teratogens, including toluene, giving rise to phenotypic facial abnormalities similar to those of the fetal alcohol syndrome. We propose a common mechanism of craniofacial teratogenesis for toluene and alcohol, namely a deficiency of craniofacial neuroepithelium and mesodermal components due to increased embryonic cell death.",Immunology
7509809,"The residues Leu(Ile)475-Ile(Leu, Val, Ala)476, contained in the extended carboxyl cytoplasmic tail, are critical for targeting of the resident lysosomal membrane protein LIMP II to lysosomes. LIMP II, a type II lysosomal integral membrane protein, and the CD36/LIMP II construct are targeted to lysosomes by means of a signal expressed in the tyrosine-lacking carboxyl cytoplasmic tail of LIMP II (Vega, M. A., Rodriguez, F., Seguí, B., Calés, C., Alcalde, J., and Sandoval, I. V. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 16269-16272; Vega, M. A., Seguí-Real, B., Garcia, J. A., Calés, C., Rodriguez, F., Vandekerckhove, J., and Sandoval, I. V. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 16818-16824). Substitution of Leu475 with Ile resulted in a decreased efficiency of targeting. Mutant forms produced by substituting Leu475 by hydrophobic residues with either large (Val) or small (Ala, Gly) side chains, or by a charged residue (Asp), showed inhibited targeting. In contrast, the contiguous Ile476 residue could be replaced by either Leu, without loss in the efficiency of targeting, or by Val or Ala, with some impediment. Substitution of Ile476 by either Gly or Asp inhibited completely the targeting. The addition of the sequence Ser-Trp-Asp to the carboxyl end of the construct did not interfere with targeting. Data from 1H NMR analysis of the icosapeptide corresponding to the carboxyl cytoplasmic tail of LIMP II indicated the predominance of structures with extended random coil conformations, suggesting that the targeting signal is contained in a domain with an extended configuration.",Immunology
7509102,"Localization of Cu/Zn and Mn superoxide dismutase in various thyroid disorders. The intracellular localization of Cu/Zn- and Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), which catalyze the dismutation of superoxide radicals (O2-) to O2 and H2O2, was studied in the thyroid tissue of various thyroid disorders by an immunohistochemical technique. The concentrations of both SODs in those tissues were measured also by a sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique. Copper/zinc-SOD in thyroid tissues were identified by immunocytochemical staining in most cases of papillary carcinoma and in some cases of other thyroid disorders. In normal follicular cells this enzyme is localized in the perinuclear cytoplasm, whereas in thyroid tumor or hyperplastic follicular cells it exists homogeneously in cytoplasm. Manganese-SOD stained strongly in papillary carcinoma and papillary-growing cells in the thyroid tissue of adenoma and Graves' disease. The concentrations of Cu/Zn-and Mn-SOD in thyroid tumor tissues and hyperplastic follicular disorders were significantly higher than those in normal thyroid tissue when they were compared as a function of protein or deoxyribonucleic acid contents. The ratio of Mn-SOD to Cu/Zn-SOD was significantly higher only in papillary carcinoma, except for other thyroid disorders as compared with that in the normal thyroid. In conclusion, SOD seems to be related to cell proliferation and differentiation in the thyroid follicular cell because Cu/Zn-SOD changes its localization in tumor and hyperplastic follicular cells and because the Mn-SOD concentration is increased in papillary carcinoma or papillary-growing cells.",Immunology

7508826,"Randomized trial of a GPIIb/IIIa platelet receptor blocker in refractory unstable angina. European Cooperative Study Group. Patients with unstable angina despite intensive medical therapy, ie, refractory angina, are at high risk for developing thrombotic complications: myocardial infarction or coronary occlusion during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Chimeric 7E3 (c7E3) Fab is an antibody fragment that blocks the platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor and potently inhibits platelet aggregation. To evaluate whether potent platelet inhibition could reduce these complications, 60 patients with dynamic ST-T changes and recurrent pain despite intensive medical therapy were randomized to c7E3 Fab or placebo. After initial angiography had demonstrated a culprit lesion suitable for PTCA, placebo or c7E3 Fab was administered as 0.25 mg/kg bolus injection followed by 10 micrograms/min for 18 to 24 hours until 1 hour after completion of second angiography and PTCA. During study drug infusion, ischemia occurred in 9 c7E3 Fab and 16 placebo patients (P = .06). During hospital stay, 12 major events occurred in 7 placebo patients (23%), including 1 death, 4 infarcts, and 7 urgent interventions. In the c7E3 Fab group, only 1 event (an infarct) occurred (3%, P = .03). Angiography showed improved TIMI flow in 4 placebo and 6 c7E3 Fab patients and worsening of flow in 3 placebo patients but in none of the c7E3 Fab patients. Quantitative analysis showed significant improvement of the lesion in the patients treated with c7E3 Fab, which was not observed in the placebo group, although the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant. Measurement of platelet function and bleeding time demonstrated > 90% blockade of GPIIb/IIIa receptors, > 90% reduction of ex vivo platelet aggregation to ADP, and a significantly prolonged bleeding time during c7E3 Fab infusion, without excess bleeding. Combined therapy with c7E3 Fab, heparin, and aspirin appears safe. These pilot study results support the concept that effective blockade of the platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptors can reduce myocardial infarction and facilitate PTCA in patients with refractory unstable angina.",Immunology
7508328,"Profile of capsaicin-induced mouse ear oedema as neurogenic inflammatory model: comparison with arachidonic acid-induced ear oedema. 1. We have investigated the mechanism of capsaicin-induced mouse ear oedema compared with that of arachidonic acid (AA)-induced ear oedema, and evaluated the possible involvement of neuropeptides in the development of capsaicin-induced oedema. 2. Topical application of capsaicin (0.1-1.0 mg per ear) to the ear of mice produced immediate vasodilatation and erythema followed by the development of oedema which was maximal at 30 min after the treatment. This oedema was of shorter duration with less swelling than AA-induced oedema (2.0 mg per ear). 3. Capsaicin-induced ear oedema was unaffected when inhibitors of arachidonate metabolites including platelet activating factor (PAF) were administered before capsaicin (250 micrograms per ear) application, while these agents significantly prevented AA-induced oedema. Dexamethasone, histamine H1 and/or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) antagonists, and substance P (SP) antagonists were effective in inhibiting both models. Furthermore, a Ca(2+)-channel blocker and the capsaicin inhibitor, ruthenium red, were effective inhibitors of capsaicin oedema but had no effect on AA-induced oedema. 4. Phosphoramidon (50 micrograms kg-1, i.v.), an endopeptidase inhibitor, markedly (P < 0.001) enhanced only capsaicin-induced ear oedema, but bestatin (0.5 mg kg-1, i.v.), an aminopeptidase, failed to enhance oedema formation. 5. Neuropeptides (1-100 pmol per site) such as rat calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), SP, neurokinin A (NKA), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which are released from capsaicin-sensitive neurones, caused ear oedema by intradermal injection. Furthermore, a synergistic effect of CGRP (10 fmol per site) and SP (10 pmol per site) on oedema formation was observed. 6. The oedema induced by neuropeptides was significantly (P<0.05 or P<0.001) inhibited when cyproheptadine (20 mg kg-1, p.o.), a histamine H, and 5-HT antagonist, was administered before injection. In contrast, nifedipine (50 mg kg-1, p.o.), a Ca2+-channel blocker, and indomethacin(10 mg kg-1, p.o., except for NKA), a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, had little effect on neuropeptide induced oedema.7. These results suggest that the mechanism of capsaicin-induced ear oedema is different from that of AA-induced oedema and suggest that the development of capsaicin-induced ear oedema is primarily mediated by neuropeptides. The neuropeptides released after activation of sensory nerves cause an increase of vascular permeability by interactions with endothelial cells and by histamine (and 5-HT)release from mast cells.",Immunology

The effect of calcium antagonists nifedipine and verapamil on spontaneous rhythmic contractions of human isolated ureter obtained from donor subjects undergoing kidney transplantation was investigated in comparison with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug indomethacin. Stop-times i.e. the time elapsing from application, were determined for each drug. The rank order of potency at 10(-8) and 10(-7) M concentrations of the drugs was: nifedipine > verapamil > or = indomethacin. However, no significant difference of the stop-times was observed at 10(-6) M concentration of the drugs tested. The rhythmic contractions were re-activated by PGF2 alpha after stoppage with indomethacin but not with nifedipine or verapamil. These results suggest that not only endogenous PG synthesis but also an influx of calcium from the extracellular space is responsible for the spontaneous rhythmic activity of human ureter. The beneficial effects of using calcium antagonists in the treatment of ureteric colic is discussed.",Immunology
7508271,"Urinary amylase isoenzymes and amylase polymorphism variants in families with diabetes mellitus type 1. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type 1 is an autoimmune disease of pancreatic beta-cells with a certain genetic predisposition that is not yet clear. In spite of the confirmed association of diabetes mellitus type 1 with several HLA haplotypes it is considered that other loci must be involved for total genetic susceptibility to the disease. The relationship of insulin deficiency and decreased pancreatic amylase activity suggests that insulin itself is a direct activator of amylase gene expression. Endocrine pancreatic function was monitored by the indirect non-invasive method of urinary pancreatic amylase activity determination (expressed in percentage of total amylase activity) in diabetic children, their parents, healthy sisters and brothers, and in a separate group of women with diabetes type 1 of over 20 years duration. The incidence of hereditary amylase polymorphism variants in these subjects was also ascertained. Decreased pancreatic amylase activity in urine (under 58%) was found to be a characteristic trait in diabetics, and a susceptibility trait in asymptomatic family members. Normal pancreatic amylase activity (66.7 +/- 5.4%) is rare in diabetic patients type 1, but may be seen as a favourable prognostic trait, representing resistance to diabetic complications. The results support the suggestion that hereditary predisposition to the disease is inherited from the father rather than the mother, and that heterozygous amylase polymorphism variants protect their carriers against diabetes mellitus type 1.",Immunology
7508201,"Endothelial gaps and permeability of venules in rat tracheas exposed to inflammatory stimuli. This study determined the number of endothelial gaps in venules of the rat trachea and related these values to the amount of plasma extravasation after an inflammatory stimulus (neurogenic inflammation). From 1 to 30 min after the stimulus, vessels were fixed by vascular perfusion, and endothelial cell borders were stained with silver nitrate, which made it possible to quantify the number and distribution of endothelial gaps. It also was possible to quantify the leukocyte attachment sites, to measure the size, shape, and number of endothelial cells, and to delineate the architecture of the tracheal vasculature. Sites of increased vascular permeability were localized with Monastral blue B, india ink, or fluorescent microspheres. After the stimulus, the silver lines around endothelial cells of postcapillary venules and collecting venules were interrupted by stereotyped silver dots (diam, 1.4 +/- 0.03 microns; +/- SE), which were found by electron microscopy to be silver deposits at endothelial gaps. The dots were most abundant in the smallest postcapillary venules (diam, 7-20 microns) where Monastral blue extravasation was greatest. The number of silver dots (14.4 +/- 0.7 dots/endothelial cell) and the amount of extravasation were maximal 1 min after the stimulus. However, the dots disappeared more slowly (half-life, 3.2 min) than did the extravasation (half-life, 1.3 min). In addition to the silver dots, 64% of the sites at which leukocytes were attached to the endothelium were stained with silver. These sites were marked by silver rings (diam, 3.4 +/- 0.2 microns) and were most numerous in the largest postcapillary venules (diam, 20-40 microns). Most (95%) of the silver rings were located at intercellular junctions but usually were not sites of Monastral blue extravasation. The results indicate that endothelial gaps at intercellular junctions are focal openings, which occupy < 3% of the luminal surface and are distinct from sites of leukocyte attachment. The reduction in Monastral blue extravasation that precedes the closure of the gaps could result from a decrease in the driving force for the convective movement of the tracer or from a decrease in the conductance of the gaps, perhaps due to the accumulation of sievelike substances within the gaps.",Immunology

Taxol, a natural product initially isolated from the stem bark of the western yew Taxus brevifolia, is undergoing phase II and III evaluation due to its reported activity against a variety of tumors. Previous studies have described correlations between plasma concentrations and toxicity when taxol is given (a) at lower doses, (b) for shorter infusion times, and (c) without granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor. Because the 24-h infusion schedule is most commonly used in current clinical trials, we attempted to correlate steady-state plasma concentrations of taxol achieved with a 24-h continuous i.v. infusion with toxicities and responses. Plasma samples from 48 refractory ovarian cancer patients were obtained 1-2 h prior to the end of the first taxol infusion. Taxol concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Interpatient variation of taxol plasma concentrations was small (mean +/- SD, 0.85 +/- 0.21 microM. Total taxol body clearance was 256 +/- 72 ml min-1 m-2 (mean +/- SD). Taxol plasma protein binding was 88.4% +/- 1.3% (mean +/- SD, n = 9). Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicity, mainly leukopenia, occurred in 92% of the patients. The leukopenia was transient and did not warrant a reduction in the dose of taxol. Grade 3-4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred in 8% of the patients. No severe hypersensitivity reaction or grade 3-4 neurotoxicity was observed. Correlations of plasma concentrations and toxicities were not feasible due to the high frequency of hematologic effects and the low frequency of nonhematologic toxicity. The low degree of interpatient variation in plasma concentrations hindered the development of correlations with response.",Immunology

The aims of this study were to define the prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies in liver donors; the risk of acquired HCV infection and HCV re-infection according to the pre-transplant anti-HCV status; the prevalence of HCV infection in post-transplant chronic hepatitis. Sera from 42 recipients with follow up longer than 6 months and their donors were tested for anti-HCV. By results at pre-transplant time patients were classified as follows: donor (D) negative and recipient (R) negative (D-/R-) 31; D-/R+ 9; D+/R- 1; D+/R+ 1. Twenty-one patients with sustained hepatic dysfunction underwent liver biopsy. In group D-/R-, 5 patients showed anti-HCV positivity and 3 (9.7%) of them had acquired HCV hepatitis. In group D-/R+, 6 patients showed persistent anti-HCV positivity and 4 (44.4%) of them had recurrent HCV hepatitis; of these 2 died due to liver failure. The 2 patients of groups D+/R- and D+/R+ had normal liver function. Anti-HCV negative hepatitis was found in 2 patients. The prevalence of anti-HCV positivity in liver donors appeared low (3.2%). Acquired HCV infection rate was 9.7%. Pre-transplant HCV infection led to a high incidence of recurrence (44.4%). HCV was the major etiological agent in post-transplant chronic hepatitis (77.8%).",Immunology
7504563,"CD44 participates in the adhesion of human colorectal carcinoma cells to laminin and type IV collagen. CD44 is a cellular adhesion molecule expressed in many different types of cells that may be a receptor for hyaluronic acid, laminin, collagen or fibronectin. In this study, we determined whether CD44 participated in the adhesion of three human colorectal carcinoma cell lines (KM-12c, CCL 188 and MIP-101) to laminin, collagen and hyaluronic acid. All lines were positive for the epithelial form of CD44 (CD44E) with a molecular weight of approximately 160 kD. All of them bound significantly to laminin and type IV collagen but not to hyaluronic acid in a solid phase adhesion assay. Three monoclonal antibodies to CD44 (Hermes 1, Hermes 3 and J173) significantly blocked the binding of colorectal carcinoma lines to laminin and collagen whereas another antibody to CD44 (50B4) bound to cells but did not inhibit adhesion. Only Hermes 1 completely abolished the binding to hyaluronic acid by a human B lymphoblastoid cell line, JY, that expressed the 90 kD haematopoietic form of CD44. Soluble hyaluronate inhibited the adhesion of JY cells to solid phase hyaluronate but did not inhibit adhesion to laminin and collagen by the colorectal carcinoma lines. Thus, (a) CD44E participates in the adhesion of colorectal carcinoma cells to laminin and type IV collagen and (b) the binding site for laminin and collagen on CD44E is different from the site for hyaluronic acid.",Immunology
7504554,"Effect of transurethral resection of the prostate on detrusor instability and urge incontinence in elderly males. Detrusor instability is common in men with evidence of outflow obstruction due to benign prostatic hypertrophy and typically reverses in about two thirds of patients after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). It is also common among the elderly without outflow obstruction and may lead to urge incontinence. To determine whether TURP has an effect on detrusor instability and urge incontinence in elderly men, or whether these abnormalities are due to other age-associated changes, 12 males (mean age 80 years) with urge incontinence or frequency and urgency of micturition, and symptomatic benign prostatic hypertrophy, were studied by 24-hour monitoring of incontinence and videourodynamic examination, before and after TURP; 7/12 patients were significantly cognitively impaired. Preoperatively, all patients showed detrusor instability, which reversed postoperatively in only one patient, a significantly smaller proportion than that consistently reported in younger patients. Preoperatively, 11/12 patients were incontinent. After TURP, 8/11 patients had an improvement in the amount of incontinence, by up to 458 g in 24 hours. Those who improved had been urodynamically more severely obstructed preoperatively. Those with the most improvement were also cognitively impaired. We conclude that, in the geriatric population, detrusor instability and urge incontinence may be the result of age-associated changes and not secondary to obstruction. Detrusor instability is likely to persist following TURP. Preoperative urodynamic assessment of obstruction in the incontinent male with benign prostatic hypertrophy may be useful since the severity of incontinence responds well to TURP if there is marked obstruction. Cognitive impairment should not be a deterrent to operation.",Immunology

The effects of acute and chronic ethanol administration on the motility of the papillary sphincter, pancreatic duct pressures, and exocrine pancreas were studied. Acute administration (n = 5) significantly reduced the peak pressure of the papillary sphincter from 84.2 +/- 19.6 to 15.8 +/- 3.0 mm Hg (p < 0.05) and increased the frequency from 0.041 +/- 0.002 to 0.067 +/- 0.005/s (p < 0.01). Chronic administration (n = 5) significantly increased pancreatic duct pressure and frequency of the papillary sphincter from 8.6 +/- 2.9 to 22.1 +/- 2.9 mm Hg (p < 0.01) and from 0.039 +/- 0.002 to 0.071 +/- 0.004/s (p < 0.01), respectively. However, it reduced the peak pressure of the papillary sphincter from 84.8 +/- 15.1 to 21.1 +/- 2.8 mm Hg (p < 0.05). Electron microscopy showed dilation and a concentric arrangement of the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the acinar cells.

However, whereas viruses encoding the ts-v-sea oncoprotein transform solely erythroid cells, viruses encoding both the v-ski and the ts-v-sea oncogenes were found capable of transforming myeloid cells from the monocytic and/or granulocytic lineages in addition to erythroid cells. Analysis of cell clones transformed by the v-ski/ts-v-sea virus identified one clone that no longer expressed the v-sea protein, indicating that this protein was necessary for the initiation but not the maintenance of transformation. Subsequent experiments testing the effects of various growth factors on transformation of bone marrow cells by the v-ski oncogene product alone identified the avian c-kit ligand (stem cell factor; SCF) as being able to co-operate with the v-ski protein to cause transformation of chicken hematopoietic cells of both myeloid and erythroid lineages.",Immunology
7504141,"Bepridil improves left ventricular performance in patients with angina pectoris. Patients with coronary artery disease and angina pectoris have abnormalities of left ventricular (LV) diastolic performance. These abnormalities, which exist when the patients are at rest and not experiencing angina, are presumably secondary to abnormalities of intracellular calcium metabolism. Twenty-three patients with chronic exertional angina pectoris participated in a placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over trial of bepridil hydrochloride. Angina frequency, nitroglycerin (NTG) consumption, and treadmill exercise capacity were assessed, and each patient underwent first-pass radionuclide cineangiography while receiving placebo or bepridil to assess LV performance. Bepridil decreased angina frequency from 8.5 +/- 0.6 to 4.4 +/- 1.5 episodes per week (p < 0.01) and NTG consumption from 7.2 +/- 2.4 to 3.6 +/- 1.5 tablets per week (p < 0.01). Total treadmill exercise time, time to onset of angina, and time to 1-mm ST segment depression increased significantly during bepridil therapy. Cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), and ejection fraction (EF) increased at rest and during peak upright bicycle exercise. Peak ejection rate and peak filling rate increased, and time to peak ejection rate and time to peak filling rate decreased at rest and at peak exercise during bepridil therapy. In addition, early diastolic filling fraction increased and atrial filling volume decreased during bepridil treatment. Bepridil is effective as monotherapy for treatment of patients with exertional angina; its use is associated with increased exercise capacity and decreased angina frequency and NTG consumption as well as improved LV systolic and diastolic performance at rest and during peak exercise.",Immunology
7504131,"Effects of diltiazem on force, [Ca2+]i, and energy metabolism in porcine coronary artery. The effects of diltiazem, a coronary-specific calcium antagonist, on isometric force generation and [Ca2+]i were measured in isolated porcine coronary artery and related to measured changes in both oxidative and aerobic glycolytic metabolism. Diltiazem, at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 microM, inhibited K+ depolarization-induced increases in tension, intracellular calcium, oxygen consumption, and aerobic lactate release. Inhibition of tension, free calcium content, and oxygen consumption was dependent on diltiazem concentration, whereas inhibition of aerobic lactate release was not strongly dependent on diltiazem concentration. Aerobic lactate release, demonstrated to be coupled to Na(+)-pump activity in porcine coronary artery, was inhibited by diltiazem, but ouabain-sensitive accumulation of potassium by potassium-depleted tissues was not. Diltiazem therefore appears to uncouple the relationship between Na(+)-pump activity and aerobic glycolysis characteristic of coronary artery metabolism. Depolarization-induced increases in oxygen consumption measured in untethered preparations to reduce active tension were also inhibited by diltiazem at concentrations > or = 3 microM. Diltiazem therefore inhibits depolarization-induced increases in intracellular calcium and tension and has major effects on both the contractile and noncontractile components of energy metabolism in coronary arteries.",Immunology
7504120,"Insulin-like growth factor II messenger ribonucleic acid expression in Wilms tumor, nephrogenic rest, and kidney. Wilms tumors (WTs) are embryonic neoplasms of the kidney that are believed to arise from primitive metanephrogenic blastema. Our previous reports and those of others indicate that WTs show an increased expression of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) mRNA. However, the precise role of IGF-II on Wilms tumorigenesis is not known. A central question is to determine whether the increased IGF-II expression in WTs simply reflects the fetal nature of WTs (effect), or is induced by specific changes in gene expression (cause). This study included 31 sporadic WTs, 7 fetal and 3 adult kidneys and 1 yolk sac tumor. Clinical and histologic summaries of WT cases are shown in Table 1. In WTs, the relative area of blastemal, epithelial, poorly differentiated spindle cell and heterologous cell components were assessed. Dot and Northern blot hybridization, using cDNA probes, were done to assess the level of IGF-II mRNA expression. In situ RNA hybridization was employed to localize IGF-II transcripts. Immunohistochemistry was applied to frozen sections to demonstrate cytokeratin and type-IV collagen. These results were then correlated with the histology of WTs and their precursor lesions, i.e., nephrogenic rests (NRs). Dot blot hybridization indicated that IGF-II transcripts were 32- to 64-fold more abundant in WTs than in the adjacent uninvolved kidneys. In situ hybridization showed that WTs, NRs, and fetal kidney shared a common feature in which IGF-II transcripts were predominantly associated with blastema. However, WTs and NRs differed from fetal kidney in that occasional epithelial structures and dense blastema showed aberrant, sustained IGF-II expression. The data indicate two points. 1) There is an inverse correlation between nephroblastic differentiation and IGF-II expression in developing fetal kidney. 2) The IGF-II expression in WTs and NRs does not simply reflect the embryonal nature of the tumor but is rather significantly altered, suggesting a role as a transforming growth factor in Wilms tumorigenesis.",Immunology
7504096,"Mechanism of oxyhemoglobin-induced release of endothelin-1 from cultured vascular endothelial cells and smooth-muscle cells. Release of endothelin-1 from cultured endothelial cells can be induced with oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb). The present study was conducted to explore whether oxyHb affects the release of endothelin-1 and the induction of endothelin-1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and to examine the mechanism whereby oxyHb induces endothelin-1 production in cultured vascular smooth-muscle cells as well as in cultured endothelial cells. Oxyhemoglobin produces concentration-dependent (0.1 to 10 microM) and time-dependent (0 to 24 hours) increases in immunoreactive endothelin-1 in conditioned medium from bovine arterial endothelial cells. Oxyhemoglobin induces immunoreactive endothelin-1 in rat aortic smooth-muscle cells in the same fashion, although the rate is 30-fold less than that of endothelial cells. This promoting effect is much higher than that of other stimulators such as thrombin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Northern blot analysis of total RNA from endothelial cells also showed endothelin-1 mRNA induction. Staurosporine, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, inhibited oxyHb-induced endothelin-1 production in both vascular endothelial and smooth-muscle cells, whereas an increase of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by forskolin or an addition of 8-bromo-cAMP only inhibited this effect in smooth-muscle cells. These findings suggest that oxyHb-induced endothelin-1 production in endothelial cells is regulated by PKC, and in smooth-muscle cells by both PKC and the cAMP-dependent pathway. The production of endothelin, the most potent vasoconstrictor, in both vascular endothelial and smooth-muscle cells by oxyHb may have significance in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm.",Immunology

Using a controlled cortical impact model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) coupled with tissue microdialysis, interstitial concentrations of aspartate and glutamate (together with serine and glutamine) were assessed in rat frontal cortex. Histological analysis indicated that the severity of injury following severe TBI (depth of deformation = 3.5 mm) was approximately twice that occurring following moderate TBI (depth of deformation = 1.5 mm). Both groups demonstrated significant postinjury maximal increases in excitatory amino acid (EAA) concentration, which were proportional to the severity of injury. The mean +/- SEM fold increase in dialysate concentrations of aspartate was 38 +/- 13 (n = 5) for moderate TBI and 74 +/- 12 (n = 5) for severe TBI. Fold increases in glutamate concentrations were 81 +/- 26 and 144 +/- 23 for moderate and severe TBI, respectively. Although these increases normalized within 20-30 min following moderate TBI, concentrations of aspartate and glutamate took > 60 min to normalize after severe TBI. Changes in levels of nontransmitter amino acids were much smaller. Fold increases for serine concentrations were 4.6 +/- 0.6 and 7.6 +/- 1.7 in moderate and severe TBI, respectively; glutamine concentrations had similar small fold increases (2.6 +/- 0.2 and 4.1 +/- 0.6, respectively). Calculation of interstitial concentrations following severe TBI indicated that aspartate and glutamate maximally increased to 123 +/- 20 and 414 +/- 66 microM, respectively. To determine the extent to which such tissue concentrations of EAAs could contribute to the injury seen in TBI, the EAA receptor agonists N-methyl-D-aspartate and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid were slowly injected into rat cortex. Remarkably similar histological injuries were produced by this procedure, supporting the notion that TBI is an excitotoxic injury.",Immunology

7503990,"Loss of a neutralizing epitope by a spontaneous point mutation in the V3 loop of HIV-1 isolated from an infected laboratory worker. The third hypervariable region, or V3 loop, represents the principal neutralizing domain of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Sequential viral isolates from a laboratory worker (LW) accidentally infected with HIV-1IIIB in 1985 were analyzed using type-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies directed to the V3 loop. A single amino acid substitution, Ala-->Thr at position 21 in the V3 loop of HIV-1LW isolated in 1987, was shown to determine the loss of the neutralizing epitope recognized by one of the monoclonal antibodies (M77). However, this antibody efficiently recognized linear V3 loop peptides containing either the Ala or Thr residue at position 21, indicating that a local change in conformation was responsible for the epitope loss in the native gp120. Molecular modeling studies, experimentally supported by different amino acid replacements at position 21, indicated that the Ala-->Thr substitution leads to a drastic change in the domain of the V3 loop, which contains the complementary surface for antibody binding. These results provide evidence for the first time that a conformation-dependent epitope within the V3 loop of HIV-1 is involved in the generation of neutralization escape mutants in vivo.",Immunology
7502978,"The hypoglossal canal: normal MR enhancement pattern. To review the anatomy of the hypoglossal canal and present the normal precontrast and postcontrast MR appearance of axial posterior fossa images. Thirty-one axial MR examinations of the normal posterior fossa were retrospectively reviewed. The hypoglossal canals are well seen on 3-mm-thick axial MR images of the posterior fossa (28 [90%] of 31 patients). Symmetric intense intracanalicular enhancement after intravenous administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine is routine, typically with minor anterior extension into the nasopharyngeal region (28 [100%] of 28). A linear filling defect traversing the enhanced canal often is seen (21 [75%] of 28) and may represent hypoglossal nerve rootlets. Circumferential enhancement of the meninges at the level of the foramen magnum was a common finding (19 [64%] of 28). Enhancement within the hypoglossal canal with anterior extension beneath the skull base is a normal finding. This pattern is characteristic enough on MR imaging to aid interpretation of skull base lesions and to exclude the possibility of a mass within the hypoglossal canal.",Immunology

Four of 13 neoplasms were found in the spleen; skin and kidney each had 2 neoplasms. Single vascular neoplasms were in the liver, testicle, uterus, mesenteric lymph node, and vagina. Hemangioma was more common (5 males, 2 females) than hemangiosarcoma (3 males, 2 females). Vascular neoplasms were considered the cause of death in 2 females, both with hemangiosarcomas involving the spleen or kidney. One male had 2 primary hemangiomas in separate organs. Vascular neoplasms are infrequently reported [1/82 females (1.2%), 1961; 9/880 both sexes (1.0%), 1985] in this rat strain.

7500664,"Using the information system to assess change: the impact of downsizing the acute sector. A population-based approach was used to monitor impact of hospital bed closures in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Four years of administrative data were analyzed. Access to hospital services was not adversely affected: The reduction in beds resulted in increases in outpatient surgery and earlier discharges. In addition, access favored the admission of persons with more health care needs. Quality of care, as measured by mortality within 3 months of admission, readmission rates within 30 days of discharge, and increased contact with physicians within 30 days of discharge, did not change. The health status of the Winnipeg population, measured by premature mortality, did not change. However, health status and hospital use was found to be strongly related to socioeconomic status. In light of this gradient, the authors conclude that well designed and evaluated experiments that focus on the determinants of health, rather than on providing more health care services, could help identify ways of reducing hospital use.",Immunology
7500659,"Expected hospital costs of knee replacement for rural residents by location of service. This article assesses the relative cost of providing a specific procedure, knee replacement (KR) surgery, to rural residents in rural community-based hospitals rather than in urban hospitals. Costs are predicted using regression analysis with readily available data from Health Care Financing Administration's Medicare Provider Analysis and Review. The specification incorporates the effect of referral patterns on volume and the subsequent impact on costs in the different settings. The predicted cost per case was found to be lower in rural rather than urban hospitals across all patient types. Findings indicate scale economies exist for KR surgery in both the urban and rural hospital settings. Results also suggest the total cost of a hospitalization associated with KR surgery in rural hospitals is more sensitive to changes in procedure volume than in urban hospitals, providing preliminary support for increased regionalization of KR surgery in rural hospitals. While long-term outcome measures associated with successful KR surgery (improved function, reduced pain, etc.,) are not available, mortality rates and perisurgical complication rates were not significantly different between rural patients who received KR surgery in rural hospitals and those who received KR surgery in urban hospitals. Among rural hospitals, however, complication rates were significantly correlated with procedure volume (complication rates were significantly lower in rural hospitals that performed more than nine KR surgeries a year). Our results suggest KR surgery can be delivered efficiently in rural community-based settings and support the case for regionalization of this procedure.

Although urine is the sample of choice for drug tests in racehorses, it is rarely obtained following the sudden death of a racehorse on the track while racing. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the significance of postmortem tissue samples as an alternative to urine and blood samples in equine drug analysis following the sudden death of a racehorse on the track while participating in a competitive race. Postmortem tissue samples were frozen (-80 degrees C) until analyzed. A 30-40-g portion of each organ was homogenized in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), deproteinized, hydrolyzed with beta-glucuronidase, extracted, and screened by thin-layer chromatography and immunoassay. Samples that initially tested positive for drug(s) were then extracted using high-flow, solid-phase extraction cartridges. The eluates were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The presence of butorphanol in horses HB355 and CD387, pentobarbital in horse HO940, and ergotamine in horses HO940 and CD387 was detected and confirmed. Thus, in the absence of urine and blood samples following sudden death, postmortem tissue samples are equally useful for forensic toxicological investigations of racehorses.",Immunology

Cardiac IKACh is comprised of two inwardly rectifying K+ channel subunits, CIR and GIRK1 (Krapivinsky, G., Gordon, E. G., Wickman, K., Velimirovic, B., Krapivinsky, L., and Clapham, D. E. (1995) Nature 374, 135-141). A cardiac protein virtually identical to CIR, termed rcKATP-1 (Ashford, M. L. J., Bond, C. T., Blair, T. A., and Adelman, J. P. (1994) Nature 370, 456-459), was reported to form an ATP-sensitive inwardly rectifying K+ channel, IKATP. We attempted to determine whether CIR alone or together with an unknown protein(s) participated in the formation of cardiac IKATP. Expression of CIR in insect, oocyte, and mammalian cell systems did not increase the appearance of ATP-sensitive currents, but rather gave rise to unique strongly inwardly rectifying, G protein-regulated K+ currents. CIR protein is found exclusively in atria, in contrast to the predominance of IKATP functional activity in ventricle. Also, CIR was completely depleted from heart membrane after immunodepletion of GIRK1. We conclude that CIR/rcKATP-1 is not a subunit of cardiac IKATP and that GIRK1 is the only channel protein coassociating with CIR in heart.",Immunology

In essential hypertensive patients, considered to be insulin-resistant, a blunted decline in nocturnal blood pressure is associated with increased adrenergic tone and left ventricular mass. Since insulin stimulates the sympathetic system, we tested whether insulin resistance and insulinemia influence left ventricular mass and the 24-hour blood pressure profile. We studied 29 nonobese hypertensive patients with office diastolic pressure between 95 and 110 mm Hg and normal oral glucose tolerance test after a 4-month washout period. They were then assigned to M-mode echocardiographic evaluation and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The glucose and insulin responses to a 75-g oral glucose load were compared with those obtained in 16 weight-matched normotensive control subjects. During the oral glucose tolerance test the hypertensive patients compared with control subjects presented higher levels of glucose at 60 minutes (138.7 +/- 30.3 versus 108.7 +/- 35.7 mg/dL; P < .05) and 90 minutes (114.0 +/- 23.8 versus 94.8 +/- 31.1 mg/dL; P < .05) and insulin at 60 minutes (287.1 +/- 259.4 versus 142.1 +/- 83.9 pmol/L; P < .05). However, peak insulin levels after glucose load did not correlate with ambulatory blood pressure values or left ventricular mass index. Left ventricular mass index showed significant correlation with mean sleeping systolic pressure (rs = 56, P < .05) and diurnal systolic pressure (rs = .37, P < .05) but not with mean diurnal or sleeping diastolic pressures. In conclusion, our results indicate that in nonobese hypertensive patients, insulin resistance does not have any influence on the 24-hour blood pressure profile or on left ventricular mass index.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology

The postprandial effects of three fat-loads were followed for 5 h. Division of Nutrition, University of Helsinki. Twelve healthy female subjects (aged 23-38 years) were recruited among university students and employees. Postprandial lipaemia was induced by high-fat meals containing fat (RO, SO or BO) 1 g/kg of body weight, skim-milk powder, sugar, strawberries, and water. Each subject ingested each meal in three separate mornings after an overnight fast. The order of the meals was randomised. Blood samples were taken before and 1, 2.5, and 5 h after the test meal. All three test meals similarly affected platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma. Aggregation induced by collagen (0.6, 1 and 2.5 micrograms/ml) decreased during the 5-h period after the meals (P = 0.000). ADP-induced aggregation did not change during the follow-up period after any meal (P = 0.105-0.483).

Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis is a distressing affliction that denies the victim the benefit of normal diet, careers that require normal speech and causes severe facial disfigurement that aggravates psychological stress. Opinions in current literature portray controversy in its management. Hurried clinicians take shortcuts and partially treat symptoms and often make the condition worse. Others ignore shortcomings and erroneously prescribe their preferred techniques as absolute indication to the peril of the affected children. Gap arthroplasty if applied in a growing maxillofacial skeleton as in children, causes iatrogenic arrest of facial growth. The intended correction of facial disfigurement is therefore not achieved. Early detection and immediate psychological support by excision and reconstruction of ankylosed TMJ with a costochondral graft, improves patient comfort and rehabilitation when used as a planned part of a comprehensive therapy. This paper questions prior varied opinions and discusses scientific baseline considerations in management of long standing TMJ ankylosis in children in relatively affordable circumstances.",Immunology

Four species of Glossina had been reported from Gambella out of the five species found in the country in surveys made before 1985. These are Glossina morsitans ugadensis, G. pallidipes, G. fuscipes and G. tachinoides. A tsetse fly survey was carried out in parts of Gambella owing to the fact that the area is undergoing ecological changes due to massive deforestation (because of resettlement and development programmes), poaching, and introduction of domestic animals into tsetse infested parts of Gambella after 1985. Tsetse populations were sampled for one year, March 1993-April 1994, using biconical traps and hand catches. The survey has reported all Glossina spp which were previously reported except G. morsitans ugadensis. It seems that a combination of factors, such as, lack of host and increase in human population have forced G. morsitans ugadensis to decline. This study has consolidated the fact that tsetse flies of the morsitans group specially G. morsitans, are easily affected by human interference while the palpalis group is resistant to this factor. In addition, this study has also indicated, villagization and rural development could be practised where G. morsitans is the only species in a certain area to alleviate pressure on already impoverished land in parts of Africa.",Immunology

Polymer-coated removable stents were used to deliver 14C-labeled etretinate and 3H-labeled forskolin to the vessel wall in 31 New Zealand White rabbits to study their kinetics. Stents loaded with etretinate (n = 8) and forskolin (n = 14) were implanted in the rabbit carotid arteries, and the animals were euthanized at different time intervals. Drug levels were measured in the media and adventitia of the stented segment, in distant tissues, and in blood. In four rabbits, forskolin-loaded stents were percutaneously retrieved 2 hr after implantation in the carotid artery, and the tissue and blood levels were determined 2 and 24 hr after retrieval. In seven rabbits etretinate-loaded stents were retrieved 72 hr after implantation in abdominal aorta, and drug levels were measured in the tissues and blood immediately after and at 1 and 4 days after retrieval. Levels of etretinate in the vessel wall peaked at 24 hr (250 ng/mg) and remained high up to 72 hr (185 ng/mg) after stent placement. Levels of forskolin peaked within 2 hr of stent placement (135 ng/mg) and rapidly declined to 4.9 ng/mg at 24 hr with the stent in situ. About 50% (1.4 mg) of the original etretinate remained in the stent at 72 hr compared to about 5% (0.08 mg) of forskolin at 24 hr.

The frequency of episodes of otitis media was determined, as well as the age at which the first such episode occurred. Information about smoking in the home had been obtained when the child was two weeks old and again at 6, 12, 18 and 40 months of age. In all, 119 mothers (13%) smoked at least 20 cigarettes a day on average, 205 (22%) smoked less than 20, and 593 (65%) stated that they did not smoke at all. Children of mothers who smoked 20 or more cigarettes per day were at significantly increased risk of having four or more episodes of acute otitis media: relative risk (RR) = 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-3.0 and of having their first episode earlier in life RR = 1.3 (CI = 1.0-1.8), after adjustment. Moreover, the risk of recurrent (> or = four episodes) otitis media increases with the amount of cigarettes smoked.

7495499,"Parathyroid hormone-related protein. We review the current state of knowledge of the molecular properties and actions of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) both in cancer patients and in normal physiology. PTHrP is a common product of squamous cancers and is the major mediator of the syndrome of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) by its actions through parathyroid hormone receptors in bone and kidney. Recently developed radioimmunoassays and tissue localization techniques indicate that PTHrP is produced by many more cancers than was originally indicated by clinical studies and that it contributes significantly to malignancy-related hypercalcemia associated with other etiologies, for example, cancers metastatic to bone and hematological malignancies. The gene encoding PTHrP is complex, with multiple exons coding for up to 12 alternate transcripts and three different length proteins, potentially in a tissue-specific manner, by the use of three promoters. Its expression is regulated by hormones and growth factors, and the untranslated exons display features in common with many cytokine genes. Although potential endocrine actions of PTHrP are evident in fetal development, further evidence suggesting that the normal physiological role of PTHrP is predominantly as a locally produced regulator/cytokine comes from localization studies and investigations of its actions in a variety of tissues. Such studies indicate that in addition to its parathyroid hormone-like actions, PTHrP has multiple activities, including those in fetal development, placental calcium transfer, lactation, smooth muscle relaxation, and on epithelial cell growth. Although PTHrP was discovered because of its production by cancers, evidence for its actions as a local regulator highlights the importance of understanding its roles not only in the etiology of HHM in cancer patients but also in normal tissues.",Immunology

Examination of related strains implied that the Esp phenotype was caused by the deletion of DNA that lies close to, but is distinct from, the glucose kinase gene (glkA). Co-transduction of the Esp phenotype with the deletion present in J1668 confirmed this hypothesis. The size of the deletion was found to be 7.4 kb.

The differential diagnosis of stridor in an infant depends on a careful history and examination, followed by radiological and endoscopic investigations. Currently a chest, lateral neck and antero-posterior, high kilovolt (Cincinnatti) view radiographs in association with a diagnostic barium swallow are performed prior to the definitive diagnostic procedure of microlaryngobronchoscopy. Our impression was that some of the routinely ordered radiological investigations were of limited value in the differential diagnosis. We undertook a retrospective audit study to determine the value of radiological investigations in the pre-endoscopic assessment of infants with stridor. The radiological and endoscopic information of 100 infants presenting over the three-year period 1991-1993 at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London (a tertiary referral centre) was collected. It was found that only five out of 65 barium swallow investigations performed had consistent positive findings at diagnostic microlaryngobronchoscopy. The lateral neck and Cincinnatti views identified many of the more gross pathologies of the larynx and trachea e.g. the space occupying lesions, which occur infrequently. The more common diseases e.g. laryngomalacia or subglottic stenosis are rarely identified radiologically. Our results confirmed that radiology had a limited screening role and that in a child presenting with stridor the initial radiological assessment should be a chest radiograph with further imaging and a barium swallow only if an abnormality is found at microlaryngobronchoscopy.",Immunology

In a UK study of 183 individuals from 112 families we have previously shown a fairly similar disease course within families, but quite marked inter-familial variation. We have confirmed an increase in severity when the gene is inherited from an affected mother, but evidence that women are more severely affected than men is lacking. Age at onset of symptoms, of deafness and at diagnosis are identical for the entire dataset and for a comparison of 10 male/female sibling pairs. Only three out of 42 pregnancies in symptomatic women were accompanied by a reversible worsening in symptoms due to vestibular schwannomas.

7493646,"Different basal NAD levels determine opposite effects of poly(ADP-ribosyl)polymerase inhibitors on H2O2-induced apoptosis. We have recently described that poly(ADP-ribosyl)-polymerase (PARP) inhibitors rescue U937 cells from apoptosis induced by 1 mM H2O2 oxidative stress; PARP activation leads to a reversible drop in NAD level, which could be blocked by PARP inhibitors (Nos-seri et al., 1994, Exp. Cell Res. 212, 367-373). A phenotypic variant of U937 is characterized by a lower basal NAD level (low NAD, LN U937, as opposed to the original high NAD, HN U937). In LN cells treatment with 1 mM H2O2, although activating PARP, does not lower NAD concentration; puzzlingly, PARP inhibitors increase (instead of decreasing, as occurs in HN cells) the extent of stress-induced apoptosis, leading to a reduced cell survival. NAD concentration could be increased in LN cells by adding nicotinamide (5-and 25-fold increase) to the culture medium. These cells (LN+) behaved as HN U937: oxidative stress induced a NAD drop, the extent of which is dependent on the cells' basal NAD level; moreover, PARP inhibitors could rescue LN+ cells from peroxide-induced apoptosis. H2O2-induced apoptosis is not triggered by NAD depletion, but instead it takes place only when NAD levels have been preserved or have recovered: on HN U937, peroxide doses (5 and 10 mM) which lead to necrosis induce an irreversible NAD drop, whereas apoptosis occurs only at lower doses, where NAD depletion is reversible; on LN cells NAD levels do not drop even upon 10 mM H2O2 treatment, and these cells die only by apoptosis; moreover, in HN cells apoptosis is not detectable until 8 h posttreatment, when NAD levels recover, whereas in LN cells, where NAD is always present, apoptosis begins to take place as early as 3 h after stress.",Immunology

Using mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) HIS55, we identified a nuclear antigen (ag) that exhibited a staining pattern of discrete foci. Such foci could be detected in cells of many mammalian species. These nuclear foci were not associated with nuclear membrane, nucleoli, or mitotic chromosomes. In isolated rat liver nuclei, HeLa cells, and normal human and rat lymph nodes, staining of HIS55 colocalized with that of 5E10. 5E10 recognizes PML nuclear domains, multimolecular complexes of unknown function containing the product of PML gene and at least two other components. HIS55 foci were expressed widely in many tissues but the expression level varied in a cell type-specific manner, with the number of HIS55 nuclear foci ranging from 0 (as in neurons) to over 100 (as in megakaryocytes) and the size ranging from fine (as in cortical thymocytes) to very large (as in urethra epithelium). HIS55 ag expression level also varied among cells of the same lineage, as observed in embryonic development of rat and in the hemopoietic system of adult rat. The expression level of HIS55 foci roughly correlated with the overall rate of protein synthesis of cells, supporting a role of PML domains as transcription regulatory units. The expression of HIS55 foci, however, did not correlate with the growth index of cell populations. Our observations on normal tissues agreed with the hypothesis that PML domain expression is regulated by external, possibly site-dependent factors. We further supported this by demonstrating that PML domains in rat ventral prostate epithelia were upregulated upon castration.",Immunology
7493631,"Detection of nucleotide excision repair incisions in human fibroblasts by immunostaining for PCNA. During nucleotide excision repair, damaged DNA is incised on both sides of a lesion and an oligomer containing the damage is excised and replaced by repair DNA synthesis. The latter step is accomplished in vitro by proteins that include the DNA polymerase accessory factor PCNA, which binds to DNA ends to initiate repair synthesis. An increased association of PCNA with nuclei occurs after UV irradiation of nonreplicating DNA in normal human fibroblasts, probably following incision of damaged DNA. This property was used to detect the catalysis of nucleotide excision repair incisions in damaged DNA in vivo, by immunostaining of quiescent human fibroblasts with the widely available PC10 antibody. We summarize here a comprehensive survey of PCNA immunostaining in repair-defective xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) cells in comparison to normal cells. XP-A and XP-G cells were completely defective in staining for PCNA 30 min after UV irradiation. This strongly suggests that XPA and XPG proteins are absolutely required in cells before any incisions can be formed in damaged DNA. XP-B, XP-C, XP-D, and XP-F cells showed an intermediate level of staining for PCNA after UV irradiation, indicative of partial incision capacity in those cells. UV-irradiated XP-E and XP-V cells showed normal PCNA immunostaining levels, consistent with evidence that the corresponding factors are not essential for the incision step of repair. The results provide further evidence for the involvement of PCNA in the repair process in vivo and give an alternative to traditional approaches for measurement of nucleotide excision repair capability.",Immunology
7493203,"Strength and aerobic training attenuate muscle wasting and improve resistance to the development of disability with aging. By the age of 50 yrs old, humans become aware that they are losing muscle strength (mass) and endurance (mitochondria). A frequent symptom of neuromuscular disorders is muscle weakness (Walton, 1988). We define the aging-associated muscle wasting as a progressive neuromuscular syndrome that will lower the quality of life in the elderly by (1) decreasing the ability to lift loads (progressing to difficulty arising from a chair), and (2) decreasing endurance (leading to an inability to perform the activities of daily living, which increases health care costs). Campion (1994) states that the most successful outcome would be for the very elderly to take control of the last stage of their life and make it worth living. To obtain this goal, prevention of muscle wasting is an absolute requirement. Muscle mass and motor unit number, activation, and synchronization are highly related to strength; both decrease with aging (Rodgers and Evans, 1993). Resistance-training is the best way to increase muscle mass, neural coordination, and strength. Mitochondrial concentration is highly related to endurance capacity in young and old (Holloszy and Coyle, 1984). Both muscle contractile and mitochondrial protein decrease with aging in sedentary humans (reviewed by Rodgers and Evans, 1993). Endurance training, which is the best exercise to increase/maintain mitochondrial concentration with aging, has generally resulted in relatively small functional benefits to nursing home patients (Fiatarone et al., 1994).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology

Mice lacking TGF-beta 3 exhibit an incompletely penetrant failure of the palatal shelves to fuse leading to cleft palate. The defect appears to result from impaired adhesion of the apposing medial edge epithelia of the palatal shelves and subsequent elimination of the mid-line epithelial seam. No craniofacial abnormalities were observed. This result demonstrates that TGF-beta 3 affects palatal shelf fusion by an intrinsic, primary mechanism rather than by effects secondary to craniofacial defects.",Immunology

Cholesterol-derived oxysterols such as cholestanol, cholestanone and coprostanone were able to potentiate epinephrine-induced lipolysis in intact rat adipocytes but not cholesterol. The relative potency of the oxysterols followed the sequence: cholestanone > or = coprostanone > cholestanol. Cholestanone was selected to study its mode of action on epinephrine-induced lipolysis. A sustained increase in the level of cAMP was observed in adipocytes incubated with both cholestanone and epinephrine compared to a transient peaking of cAMP in adipocytes incubated with epinephrine alone. Binding assays using [125I]cyanopindolol (beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist) showed that cholestanone could increase the binding affinity of [125I]-cyanopindolol to beta-adrenergic receptors on rat adipocyte ghost membranes without affecting the total number of binding sites. The results suggest that cholestanone exerts its potentiation effect by facilitating the binding of beta-adrenergic agonist to its receptor.",Immunology

The proportion of living sperm in semen from six representative mammals was assessed by means of a dual staining technique using the stains SYBR-14 and propidium iodide (PI). SYBR-14, a newly developed fluorescent nucleic acid stain, maximally absorbs at 488 nm and emits at 518 nm when bound to DNA. Microscopic examination revealed that SYBR-14 stained the nuclei of living sperm bright green as determined by simultaneous examination of fluorescence and motility. Conversely, PI stained only nonmotile sperm that had lost their membrane integrity. Sperm from bulls, boars, rams, rabbits, mice, and men were stained and examined through use of fluorescence microscopy. The proportions of living and dead sperm were determined by first staining with SYBR-14 and PI and then assessing stain uptake by flow cytometry. Similar staining patterns were observed in all six mammalian species tested. Three populations of sperm were identified: living--SYBR-14 stained, dead--PI stained, and moribund--doubly stained. The SYBR-14 staining was replaced by PI staining as sperm progressed from living to moribund. The transition from green (SYBR-14) to red (PI) fluorescence started at the posterior region of the sperm head and proceeded anteriorly. The proportions of living and dead sperm in mammalian semen were readily identified through use of dual staining with SYBR-14 and PI and quantified through use of flow cytometry.",Immunology

7491649,"Measurement of infarct size using MRI predicts prognosis in middle cerebral artery infarction. An accurate measure of the severity of ischemic insult and the resulting prognosis is needed to assess the effectiveness of new treatments for acute stroke. We studied the reproducibility and accuracy of measurements of infarct volume with MRI and correlated the measurements with outcome. Infarct volume was measured on T2-weighted images with the Analyze image analysis software. This technique was found to be highly accurate and reproducible. Measurements of infarct volume were found to be highly accurate and reproducible. Twenty-one patients (mean age, 66.5 years; range, 28 to 90 years) with cortical middle cerebral artery territory infarcts in whom adequate data could be obtained were studied within 72 hours from onset (mean delay to MRI, 27.5 hours; range, 5 to 72 hours). The Scandinavian Stroke Scale was used to calculate a prognostic score, and clinical outcome was assessed at 3 months. Infarct volume was found to significantly predict outcome. Mean infarct volume in the independent patients was 35.7 +/- 29.7 cm3 compared with 88.3 +/- 71.3 cm3 in dependent patients and 166.5 +/- 65.9 cm3 in dead patients (F = 10.52, P < .001). Patients with an initial infarct volume less than 80 cm3 were found to have a better outcome than those with larger infarct volumes. Secondary hemorrhage visible on MRI also predicted a poor outcome. In contrast, the Scandinavian Stroke Scale did not significantly predict outcome. The results demonstrate that measurement of the size of middle cerebral artery infarction with MRI is a useful tool in assessing prognosis and will have a valuable role in assessing new therapeutic agents.",Immunology

7490261,"Possible involvement of protein-tyrosine kinases such as p72syk in the disc-sphere change response of porcine platelets. We previously reported that p72syk, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, was activated maximally at 10 s after thrombin or thromboxane A2 stimulation, even in platelets that were not allowed to aggregate [Taniguchi et al. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2277-2279; Maeda et al. (1993) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 197, 62-67]. Then, the change in the shape of porcine platelets induced by the thromboxane A2 analogue, STA2, and the role of protein-tyrosine kinases including p72syk in this response were evaluated, using the shape-change parameter. We show that p72syk activation is correlated with the disc-sphere change in a time- and dose-dependent manner following stimulation by STA2. Tyrphostin B44, a potent protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, reduced the thromboxane A2-evoked p72syk activation and the disc-sphere change in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the translocation of p72syk to the cytoskeleton-rich fraction and an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of an about 120 kDa protein were observed during the disc-sphere change induced by STA2. These lines of evidence suggest that the activation of protein-tyrosine kinases such as p72syk may be involved in the disc-sphere change response in thromboxane A2-stimulated porcine platelets.",Immunology

7489725,"The fragile X mental retardation syndrome protein interacts with novel homologs FXR1 and FXR2. Fragile X Mental Retardation Syndrome is the most common form of hereditary mental retardation, and is caused by defects in the FMR1 gene. FMR1 is an RNA-binding protein and the syndrome results from lack of expression of FMR1 or expression of a mutant protein that is impaired in RNA binding. The specific function of FMR1 is not known. As a step towards understanding the function of FMR1 we searched for proteins that interact with it in vivo. We have cloned and sequenced a protein that interacts tightly with FMR1 in vivo and in vitro. This novel protein, FXR2, is very similar to FMR1 (60% identity). FXR2 encodes a 74 kDa protein which, like FMR1, contains two KH domains, has the capacity to bind RNA and is localized to the cytoplasm. The FXR2 gene is located on human chromosome 17 at 17p13.1. In addition, FMR1 and FXR2 interact tightly with the recently described autosomal homolog FXR1. Each of these three proteins is capable of forming heteromers with the others, and each can also form homomers. FXR1 and FXR2 are thus likely to play important roles in the function of FMR1 and in the pathogenesis of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Syndrome.",Immunology
7489583,"[The human genome--chromosome 20]. There is an increasing interest on one of the smallest human chromosomes as it is shown by the First International Symposium on the Human Chromosome 20 and by the genetic map prepared by EUROGEN. The conserved part of the long arm of human chromosome 20 is synthenic with the distal part of the mouse chromosome 2 allowing for some analogies between them. Human chromosome 20 contains several important genes for the human pathology. Mutations of one of them, the vasopressin-neurophysin II gene, are responsible for hereditary neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus. Severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosin deaminase deficiency is the first human disorder successfully treated by somatic gene therapy. Spongiform encephalopathies are related to mutation and/or polymorphisms of the PRNP amyloid gene. One form of benign familiar neonatal convulsions is mapped to a specific locus on chromosome 20. In some families, maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is caused by alterations of a hypothetical gene closely linked to the ADA locus. Allegile syndrome is often associated with deletions and microdeletions of the short arm of the chromosome. Finally, deletions of the long arm of the chromosome is a frequent finding in several hematologic malignities, specifically in myeloproliferative disorders and myelodysplastic syndromes.",Immunology

No amplification was observed with Enterococcus casseliflavus or vancomycin-susceptible strains. Using PCR and Southern blotting, we found that all 17 VanA isolates had orf-1, orf-2, vanR, vanS, vanH, vanA, and vanY genes in the same sequence and that the intergenic distances in the vanR-vanA segments were the same.

The alpha-chemokines have been implicated as regulators of proliferation and differentiation of normal keratinocytes and as mediators of keratinocyte maturation and migration in inflammatory processes that involve the skin. Using the cutaneous wound repair model, we examined the sites and temporal sequence of the appearance of melanoma growth stimulatory activity or growth-regulated gene (MGSA/GRO;ligand) and the type B interleukin (IL)-8 receptor (IL-8RB) to which MGSA/GRO binds. Human burn tissues (n = 44) representing days 2 to 12 after injury were obtained during surgical debridement, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin. Immunolocalizations were performed with polyclonal antisera for both ligand and receptor, as well as a monoclonal antibody for the IL-8 RB. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of the IL-8 RB in immunoprecipitates of epidermal keratinocyte lysates. In normal skin, MGSA/GRO protein was restricted to sites populated by differentiated keratinocytes (suprabasal compartments, inner root sheath cells, and dermal sweat ducts). MGSA/GRO protein was barely detectable within epithelial margins and islands of burn wounds where the migrating/proliferating keratinocyte populations reside, but staining intensities increased as cells matured into the outer layers. Weak diffuse staining was detected in areas of neutrophilic infiltration (granulation tissue and overlying exudates). By contrast, in normal skin the IL-8 RB was detected in specific locations within epidermal and dermal compartments of healing wounds. In the dermis, polyvalent antibodies detected receptor immunoreactivity most prominently in dermal sweat ducts and endothelium of capillaries, whereas this immunoreactivity was inconspicuous in sections stained with the monoclonal antibody. Receptor immunostaining was noted in migrating/proliferating keratinocytes in epithelial margins and islands but was in the outer layers or in hypertrophic epidermis adjacent to wounds. This same pattern was observed in epidermal appendages such as hair follicles and eccrine sweat ducts. In granulation tissues, IL-8 RB was noted in numerous fibroblasts and in subpopulations of macrophages and smooth muscle. The presence of both MGSA/GRO and its receptor in human burn wounds implicate this cytokine as an autocrine or paracrine mediator of epidermal regeneration in both the inflammatory and proliferative phases of cutaneous wound repair.",Immunology

The course of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection in human infant microglia was studied using purified primary cultures of microglia derived from brain autopsy tissue. Previous in vitro studies have used fetal or adult brain tissue. Important differences may exist between brain tissues of different maturational ages with regard to HIV-1 replication and other neuropathogenic effects. Infant microglia were infected with four different strains of HIV-1 (JR-FL, JR-CSF, Ba-L, and IIIB). Productive infection was demonstrated by p24 antigen production, immunocytochemistry, and recovery of replication-competent virus from the supernatants of the infected cultures. Multinucleated giant cells developed in culture mimicking the neuropathological changes seen in the brains of patients with HIV encephalopathy. Productive infection was more readily established by monocyte-tropic strains (JR-FL and Ba-L) of HIV-1 than by a lymphocyte-tropic strain (IIIB). p24 antigen production in this system peaked at 47 to 51 days postinfection. Viral persistence in giant cells was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry for the gp120 and gp41 viral antigens as late as 70 days postinfection. This in vitro culture system, using infant microglia that support viral replication for more than 2 months, may provide a useful model for studying the pathogenesis of progressive HIV encephalopathy.",Immunology

Our database included the multiple-marker screening test (maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, unconjugated estriol, and maternal age) and genetic amniocentesis results from 1942 women aged > or = 35. A Down syndrome risk > or = 1:190 was considered screen positive. An algorithm to detect trisomy 18 was also used.

However, the multiple-marker screening test detection rate for all aneuploidies was only 61%. Missed aneuploidies included trisomy 21, sex chromosome abnormalities, trisomy 13, trisomy 22, and trisomy 18. The multiple-marker screening test fails to detect approximately 39% of all fetal aneuploidies in women aged > or = 35.

Our purpose was to study the incidence and location of histologic evidence of intrauterine bleeding in preterm and term placentas. A total of 462 consecutive placentas delivered at < 32 weeks' gestation, from which cases of placenta previa, stillbirth, and multiple gestation were excluded, were compared with 108 consecutive term placentas (with similar exclusion criteria) in regard to the presence of hemosiderin in decidua of basal plate or placental membranes. Of the 462 preterm cases, 448 charts made specific reference to the presence or absence of vaginal bleeding. Bloody show alone was not considered bleeding. The blinded scoring of lesions (including acute ascending infection, uteroplacental vascular pathologic processes and related ischemic damage, chronic inflammation, and coagulation related lesions) was analyzed by contingency tables (p < 0.05 significant). A total of 196 of 462 (43%) preterm placentas had any decidual hemosiderin compared with one of 108 (0.8%) at term (p < 0.00001). Among the preterm cases, hemosiderin was significantly more common in preeclampsia (45/76, 60%) and in cases clinically diagnosed as nonhypertensive abruptio placentae (21/33, 64%) than in premature membrane rupture (72/192, 37.5%) and preterm labor (58/161, 36%, p < 0.003). The incidence of placental lesions in preterm cases with extraplacental membrane hemosiderin was not different than it was in cases without hemosiderin. Placental lesions related to basal-plate decidual hemosiderin in the preterm cases were villous infarct (p < 0.0001), uteroplacental vessels with absence of physiologic change (p < 0.003) and increased numbers of circulating nucleated erythrocytes (p < 0.0007), uteroplacental thrombosis (p < 0.0001), and villous fibrosis (p < 0.0001) and hypovascularity (p < 0.0001). Among the preterm cases, 23 of 48 (48%) with first-trimester bleeding, 33 of 66 (50%) with second-trimester bleeding, and 31 of 64 (48%) with multiple episodes of bleeding had decidual hemosiderin (p < 0.0001). A clinical history of gestational bleeding was significantly less common in cases of preterm preeclampsia with histologic evidence of bleeding (four of 73, 5.5%) than in nonhypertensive abruptio placentae (18/31, 58%), premature rupture of membranes (52/183, 28%), or preterm labor (31/161, 19%, p < 0.0001). Hemosiderin was not related to clinical bleeding < 72 hours of delivery (p > 0.20). Decidual bleeding is common in all clinical types of preterm birth and is most common in preterm preeclampsia and nonhypertensive abruption placentae. A clinical history of bleeding is not correlated with the presence of decidual hemosiderin. Bleeding in the basal plate is related to histologic evidence of chronic uteroplacental vascular pathologic processes, which in cases of spontaneous prematurity (premature rupture of membranes, preterm labor, nonhypertensive abruptio placentae) may be associated with decidual bleeding which occasionally may be clinically manifested as gestational bleeding.",Immunology

Although a number of tests have been described to detect the presence of Helicobacter pylori in biopsy specimens, studies of positive and negative value have largely been performed on untreated patients; testing the reliability of posttherapy has not been done. We examined the value of the number and site of biopsies performed and the method used for specimen evaluation posttherapy. For postantimicrobial therapy of 141 patients with previously confirmed H. pylori infection, three biopsies were taken, two from the antrum and one from the corpus. Individual slides were coded, randomized, and interpreted blindly by two pathologists. Furthermore, in 143 patients, a biopsy specimen was taken from the antrum and was immediately inserted into the gel of the rapid urease test, and the results were compared with those obtained from histopathology obtained at the same time. In 71 patients, H. pylori therapy was unsuccessful; in 61 (86%), all three sites were positive. The highest yield with a single large cup biopsy specimen was 94%; the lowest was 91%. Two antral biopsies were negative in 4% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1-12%]. The combination of a biopsy from the angulus incisura and one from the greater curvature of the corpus correctly identified all treatment failures (95% CI = 95-100%). The rapid urease test was false-negative in 5% (95% CI = 1-13%); there were no false-positives. Use of either the rapid urease test or two antral biopsies for evaluation of success of antimicrobial therapy for H. pylori infection will result in a false declaration of cure in at least 5% of cases. Three large cup gastric mucosal biopsies for histology are recommended for evaluation of the success of anti-H. pylori therapy.",Immunology

During a mean follow-up of 22.6 +/- 16 months, six patients had a recurrent stroke (n = 2) or a TIA (n = 4). No systemic embolism was observed. The actuarial risk of having a recurrent stroke was 2.3% (95% confidence interval, 0.6% to 8.2%) at 2 years, whereas the risk of having a stroke or a TIA was 6.7% (95% confidence interval, 3.1% to 14.2%) at 2 years. The average annual rates of recurrence were 1.2% and 3.4%, respectively. In patients with both PFO and ASA, the actuarial risk of a first recurrent stroke was 9.0% (95% confidence interval, 2.4% to 28.5%) at 2 years, with an average annual rate of recurrence of 4.4%. As a group, patients with patent foramen ovale, atrial septal aneurysm, or both and an otherwise unexplained stroke or TIA appear to have a low risk of recurrent stroke whatever the prophylactic antithrombotic therapy used.

Hypertensives and diabetics were divided into those with or without PH, defined as > or = 10 mmHg decline in mean blood pressure in response to head-up tilt. There was no significant change in cardiac output in hypertensives or diabetics with PH, whereas there was a significant increase during tilt in hypertensives without PH (p < 0.0001) and diabetics without PH (p = 0.0054). Hypertensives without PH showed a significant decrease in total peripheral resistance in response to head-up tilt (p = 0.0043). In hypertensives with PH and in both diabetic groups, there was no change in total peripheral resistance in response to head-up tilt. There was no difference in ejection fractions or heart rate responses between subjects with and without PH in either disease group. The difference in cardiac output change was not explained by myocardial changes observed at echocardiography nor by heart rate response nor by differences in total peripheral resistance.

Ancillary investigations (including electromyography) did not disclose any cause to this episode, notably there was no underlying malignancy or systemic disease. A thorough literature review revealed another similar case which too remained unexplained. The hypothesis of a microvascular neuropathy in relation to vascular risk factors is cautiously raised; such a mechanism has been inferred previously in exceptional cases of regressive mental neuropathy in the context of sickle-cell crisis or systemic vasculitis.

A cerebral angiography was compatible with angiitis and a leptomeningeal/cerebral biopsy showed lymphocytic vasculitis in the leptomeningeal and intraparenchymatous cerebral small vessels. These results lead to start a treatment with Cyclophosphamide associated to high dose of steroids. The patient clearly improved and now is almost asymptomatic. Patient 2 concerned a 67 year-old-man that evolved for 4 years with encephalic ischemic lesions distributed and confined throughout the brain stem and cerebellum, temporary remissions occurred and the patient required high-dose steroids and Cyclophosphamide to improve. Conventional and MRI angiographies only suggested the diagnosis that was confirmed at autopsy. The patient died after a massive pulmonary thromboembolism and a complete necropsic study showed abundant lymphocytic infiltrates, without granulomatous lesions, in the intraparenchymatous and leptomeningeal cerebral small vessels specially at the brain stem and cerebellar level where many demyelinated greyish areas and few infarctions were to be seen. The inflammatory cells were, in both cases, predominantly CD4+ T lymphocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology

7480133,"Spontaneous recovery of fluorescence by photobleached surface-adsorbed proteins. Fluorescence photobleaching of a carboxyfluorescein-labeled protein (erythrocyte cytoskeletal protein 4.1) immobilized on bare glass is found to be spontaneously reversible, provided that the sample is deoxygenated. After a short (hundredths of seconds) photobleaching laser flash, the subsequent fluorescence excited by a dim probe beam partly recovers on a long (tenths of second) time scale, even in the absence of chemical exchange or diffusion processes. Neither the fraction of the fluorescence that bleaches reversibly nor its recovery rate is a strong function of fluorophore surface concentration. At a fixed surface concentration, the reversibly photobleached fraction and its recovery rate decreases with increasing duration or intensity of the bleaching flash. On the other hand, nondeoxygenated air-equilibrated samples exhibit almost total irreversible bleaching on this time scale. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy experiments occasionally require deoxygenation to avoid photochemical crosslinking or photobleaching or to enhance the triplet state population. The observation presented here indicate that fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments performed under deoxygenated conditions for measuring diffusion or chemical kinetics should be interpreted with caution: fluorescence recoveries may be due to intrinsic photochemical processes rather than fluorophore mobility. The recovery effect appears too slow to be ascribed simply to a relaxation of a triplet state; other possible explanations are offered.",Immunology
7479965,"Effects of receptor dimerization on the interaction between the class I major histocompatibility complex-related Fc receptor and IgG. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) transports maternal IgG from ingested milk in the gut to the bloodstream of newborn mammals. An FcRn dimer was observed in crystals of the receptor alone and of an FcRn-Fc complex, but its biological relevance was unknown. Here we use surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor assays to assess the role of FcRn dimerization in IgG binding. We find high-affinity IgG binding when FcRn is immobilized on a biosensor chip in an orientation facilitating dimerization but not when its orientation disrupts dimerization. This result supports a model in which IgG-induced dimerization of FcRn is relevant for signaling the cell to initiate endocytosis of the IgG-FcRn complex.",Immunology

Although tracheoesophageal fistula and esophageal atresia (TEF-EA) are surgically correctable, late respiratory complications have been reported. We administered a respiratory and gastrointestinal symptom questionnaire and performed standard pulmonary function tests (PF T's) and methacholine challenge testing on an unselected group of 25 subjects with TEF-EA who underwent surgery at our institution between 1963 and 1985. Results were compared to predicted normals, as well as 10 sibling controls. While the mean values of lung function test results for the TEF-EA group were within the normal range, they were significantly different from their siblings. Thirteen of the 25 TEF-EA group (52%), but none (0%) of the controls, had abnormal pulmonary function. This was classified as restrictive in 9 (36%), obstructive in 3 (12%), and mixed in 1. In addition, airway hyperreactivity [defined as a positive methacholine challenge (PC20 < or = 8 mg/mL)], was found in 6 of 18 TEF-EA subjects and 4 of the 9 controls who were evaluated. Comparison of TEF-EA subjects with normal and abnormal PFTs showed no difference in the incidence of tracheomalacia, esophageal strictures or dilatation, recurrent pneumonias, or gastroesophageal reflux. The respiratory symptom score in the subjects and controls was similar, and did not correlate with abnormal pulmonary function.

Bovine caseinate, derivatives of its glycosylated moiety [caseinoglycomacropeptide (CGP)], and caseinophosphopeptides were evaluated as inhibitors of adhesion of oral bacteria to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads (S-HA). All milk casein-derived components behaved as potent inhibitors of Streptococcus sanguis OMZ 9 and Streptococcus sobrinus OMZ 176 adhesion to S-HA, whereas neither bovine serum albumin nor polyethyleneglycol were able to interfere with the adhesion of these strains. By contrast, none of the molecular species tested was able to inhibit the attachment of Actinomyces viscosus Ny 1 to S-HA. On the other hand, casein derivatives were shown to displace human serum albumin from S-HA beads. They were also able to bind to the bacterial cell surface of all strains examined. Collectively, these findings suggest that interactions between acidic casein-derived milk components and the biological surfaces involved in bacterial adhesion to S-HA result in an inhibitory effect that is selective for the oral streptococci examined.",Immunology

The ability of very low birth weight (VLBW) premature infants to respond differentially to real versus a sham heelstick conditions was examined in this crossover study. Using a multidimensional assessment of responses of premature infants (n = 48) between 26 and 31 weeks gestational age (GA) at the time of the study, it was found that they respond differentially to real versus sham heelstick both behaviourally and physiologically. The multivariate effect of condition (real/sham) was significant with maximum heart rate and upper facial action (lower facial action was not scored) contributing significantly to the main effect. GA had a main multivariate effect, with the younger infants responding less robustly. The variability outcome measures of heart rate standard deviation and range of transfontanelle intracranial pressure contributed significantly to the main effect of GA, but not to the effect of condition. Young VLBW premature infants are capable of a multidimensional differential response to pain. GA is an important factor to consider when assessing pain in premature infants.",Immunology

A method for reflectance in situ hybridization (RISH) is presented. The importance of the method is demonstrated by results obtained on cytological and histological breast cancer specimens. Scattering reflectance signals from 1-nm colloidal-gold particles after RNA/RNA in situ hybridization, using digoxigenin-labelled riboprobes, were detected by confocal scanning laser microscopy. The mRNA expression of two ras-related genes, rho B and rho C, was analysed in human histological breast cancer specimens and in human breast cancer cell lines. Horizontal (x, y) and vertical (z) optical sections after three-dimensional imaging were used for visualization. A marked heterogeneity (between individual cells and between specimens) was noted for the expression of the rho B gene, both in cytological and in histological samples. On the other hand, rho C was always expressed and showed no heterogeneity. This method allows the identification of several cellular constituents in an heterogeneous tissue structure, as demonstrated by the simultaneous detection of rho B (or rho C) by reflectance and of DNA, cytokeratin and/or vimentin by fluorescence.",Immunology

Arylsulfonylamino acids, displaying a wide range of inhibitory activities versus rat lens aldose reductase (RLAR), were analyzed for enzyme selectivity in several test systems. These RLAR inhibitors were found not to produce significant inhibition of genetically-linked reductases (aldehyde reductase, ALR), catalytically similar reductases (Pachysolen tannophilus xylose reductase, PTXR), functionally distinct oxidoreductases (glutathione reductase, GR, lactate dehydrogenase, LDH, and gamma-transaminase, GABA-T), and thymidylate synthase (TS). These data suggest that aldose reductase differs significantly from other oxidoreductases in its inhibitor binding domain(s). Furthermore, the aldose reductase selectivity demonstrated by the arylsulfonylamino acids suggests that these compounds may not inhibit other key metabolic transformations in various cell types and that they may function as selective probes for studies of the relationship between aldose reductase mediated biochemical changes and the pathologies of chronic diabetes.",Immunology

TNF-R1-mediated cytotoxicity can be selectively inhibited under conditions in which Fas-mediated cell death is not affected.

Micronucleus (MN) formation and sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) assays were performed for asbestos in cultured Chinese hamster lung (V79) cells to determine the effect of surfactant treatment on the genotoxicity of two chrysotile asbestos samples of different fiber lengths. The cells were challenged in vitro with NIEHS intermediate- and short-length chrysotile fibers in both their native state and with surfactant pretreatment. For the surfactant pretreatment, the fibers were incubated in a simulated pulmonary surfactant which was prepared by ultrasonically dispersing dipalmitoyl lecithin (DPL), a primary component of pulmonary surfactant, in minimal essential medium (MEM). Chrysotile asbestos was ultrasonically mixed into the prepared surfactant dispersion or into MEM. V79 cells were exposed to DPL-treated intermediate-length chrysotile (TICA), intermediate-length chrysotile (ICA), DPL-treated short-length chrysotile (TSCA) or short-length chrysotile (SCA) fibers for 48 h. For each treatment, 2000 mononucleated cells were scored for MN formation, and 30 M2 metaphase cells were scored for SCE induction. The results showed that all samples, TICA, ICA, TSCA and SCA, caused significant elevation in the frequency of cells with micronuclei and of cells with two or more nuclei. The increase in micronucleus frequency was greatest in cells challenged with untreated intermediate-length fibers, and was greater for untreated than for DPL-treated short-length fibers. For the short-length fiber samples, DPL surfactant treatment decreased activity for multiple nucleus formation, while DPL treatment did not result in consistent changes in that activity for intermediate-length fibers. Results of SCE assays were either negative or inconclusive. Cells were more viable following TICA and TSCA than following ICA and SCA challenge as measured by cell counts after 48 h of incubation.",Immunology
7508516,"Sequence evolution of mitochondrial tRNA genes and deep-branch animal phylogenetics. Mitochondrial DNA sequences are often used to construct molecular phylogenetic trees among closely related animals. In order to examine the usefulness of mtDNA sequences for deep-branch phylogenetics, genes in previously reported mtDNA sequences were analyzed among several animals that diverged 20-600 million years ago. Unambiguous alignment was achieved for stem-forming regions of mitochondrial tRNA genes by virtue of their conservative secondary structures. Sequences derived from stem parts of the mitochondrial tRNA genes appeared to accumulate much variation linearly for a long period of time: nearly 100 Myr for transition differences and more than 350 Myr for transversion differences. This characteristic could be attributed, in part, to the structural variability of mitochondrial tRNAs, which have fewer restrictions on their tertiary structure than do nonmitochondrial tRNAs. The tRNA sequence data served to reconstruct a well-established phylogeny of the animals with 100% bootstrap probabilities by both maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining methods. By contrast, mitochondrial protein genes coding for cytochrome b and cytochrome oxidase subunit I did not reconstruct the established phylogeny or did so only weakly, although a variety of fractions of the protein gene sequences were subjected to tree-building. This discouraging phylogenetic performance of mitochondrial protein genes, especially with respect to branches originating over 300 Myr ago, was not simply due to high randomness in the data. It may have been due to the relative susceptibility of the protein genes to natural selection as compared with the stem parts of mitochondrial tRNA genes. On the basis of these results, it is proposed that mitochondrial tRNA genes may be useful in resolving deep branches in animal phylogenies with divergences that occurred some hundreds of Myr ago. For this purpose, we designed a set of primers with which mtDNA fragments encompassing clustered tRNA genes were successfully amplified from various vertebrates by the polymerase chain reaction.",Immunology

The streptomycin binding site is located in the interface between the ribosomal subunits, close to proteins S5 in the 30 S and to L11 in the 50 S ribosomal subunits. This location explains most of the antibiotic's pleiotropic effects on protein biosynthesis, especially those related to the tRNA selection mechanism, and it also correlates with the location of the ribosomal components involved in the different streptomycin phenotypes.",Immunology

If an infinitely long polymer has a primary structure characterized by an N-residue periodicity, a minimum energy conformation of the polymer under the constraint of the conformational N-residue periodicity corresponds to an equilibrium structure (energy minimal or unstable equilibrium structure) when this constraint is absent. Molecular mechanics calculations showed that with an infinitely long poly-(L,D)-alanine single-stranded beta 6.3-helix (which has a 2-residue periodicity with respect to the primary structure), its lowest energy conformation within the framework of the conformational 2-residue periodicity is also the lowest energy form of this beta 6.3-helix even when no conformational periodicity is assumed. In the course of this study, contour maps of helix parameters and conformation energies for beta structures of poly-(L,D)-alanine were examined. It was also found that beta 6.3-, beta 4.5-, alpha L,D-, and tau L,D-helices constitute the global minima in the whole conformational space of this polypeptide. In the present calculation, an improved formulation of the conformation energy was introduced to estimate the structure and conformation energy of an infinite periodic chain from results on a chain of finite length.",Immunology

Fas/APO-1 is a cell-surface protein capable of inducing apoptosis in a variety of cell types upon specific antibody engagement. Antibodies against Fas/APO-1 have been used successfully for the treatment of several lymphoid malignancies in mice. Before apoptosis triggered by anti-Fas can be fully exploited as a clinical therapy, Fas/APO-1 distribution, function, and regulation must be further studied. In this study, we analyzed freshly isolated B-cell and T-cell lymphomas as well as nonhematological tumor cell lines for Fas/APO-1 expression and sensitivity to the growth-inhibitory effects of anti-Fas. Constitutive Fas/APO-1 was expressed at very low levels on only one of eight B-cell lymphomas analyzed. Expression was markedly up-regulated, however, by culture with high-molecular-weight B-cell growth factor (HMW-BCGF). Fas/APO-1 was constitutively expressed on one of two T-cell lymphomas examined at levels comparable to those of activated normal lymphocytes. However, neither the B-cell nor T-cell lymphomas positive for Fas/APO-1 expression were growth inhibited by anti-Fas. Furthermore, in the case of one HMW-BCGF-activated B-cell lymphoma, a significant growth enhancement was observed upon anti-Fas treatment. Nonhematologic tumor cell lines showed a similar spectrum of biologic responses to anti-Fas, being growth inhibited, growth stimulated or unaffected by antibody treatment. In summary, these studies suggest that engagement of Fas/APO-1 may trigger a diverse spectrum of biologic effects not unlike other members of the nerve growth factor receptor/tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily.",Immunology

7507573,"Genotoxicity of mercury compounds. A review. This article reviews literature data concerning the genotoxicity of 29 mercury-containing agents, including laboratory compounds as well as ingredients of preparations used as fungicides, dyes, disinfectants and drugs. A variety of genetic end-points were investigated in bacteria, yeasts, moulds, plants, insects, cultured cells from fishes, rodents or humans, aquatic organisms, amphibians, mammalia and exposed humans. The overall evaluation is quite complex. Mercury compounds failed to induce point mutations in bacteria but often exerted clastogenic effects in eukaryotes, especially by binding SH groups and acting as spindle inhibitors, thereby causing c-mitosis and consequently aneuploidy and/or polyploidy. Inorganic mercury compounds were also found to induce the generation of reactive oxygen species and glutathione depletion in cultured mammalian cells. Although different mercury compounds tended to produce qualitatively comparable genetic effects, which suggests the involvement of a common toxic entity, methylmercury derivatives and other ionizable organomercury compounds were more active in short-term tests than either non-ionizable mercury compounds (e.g., dimethylmercury) or inorganic mercury salts (e.g., mercuric chloride). The results of cytogenetic monitoring in peripheral blood lymphocytes of individuals exposed to elemental mercury or mercury compounds from accidental, occupational or alimentary sources were either negative or borderline or uncertain as to the actual role played by mercury in some positive findings. Both genotoxic and non-genotoxic mechanisms may contribute to the renal carcinogenicity of mercury, which so far has been convincingly demonstrated only in male rodents treated with methylmercury chloride.",Immunology

In order to study the molecular biology of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) replication, six different recombinant baculoviruses were constructed. The following four recombinants contained genome segment A-specific sequences; (i) AcPP contained the complete polyprotein coding region and Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf) cells infected by these recombinants synthesized the 106-kDa polyprotein (NH2-preVP2-NS protease-VP3-COOH), which was only partially processed by the protease to yield preVP2 and VP3 and unprocessed polyprotein; (ii) AcPP(S) and AcPP(Ss) represented 3' truncated sequences of the segment A cDNA where the VP3 coding region and that coding for 30 and 98 carboxy terminal amino acids of NS in the two constructs, respectively, were deleted. AcPP(S) demonstrated partial, and that of AcPP(Ss), complete loss of proteolytic activity, demonstrating that the carboxy one-third of the 29-kDa NS protease is necessary for the formation of the active enzyme; and (iii) AcPP(B/B) contained all but the first 180 nt of the pVP2 gene, the complete NS coding region, and the amino end of VP3. Analysis of cells coinfected with AcPP(Ss) and AcPP(B/B) showed either that the protease did not work in trans or that the alteration of the structure of the substrate prevented cleavage. Recombinant baculoviruses AcVP1VL and AcVP1ETL contained IPNV genome segment B cDNA encoding the 94-kDa VP1 which is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. AcVP1VL contained the whole segment B cDNA, whereas in AcVP1ETL, the 5' non-coding sequences were deleted resulting in the production of large amounts of VP1 when Sf cells were infected with this recombinant. The use of recombinants AcPP and AcVP1ETL as well as monoclonal antibodies and VP1-specific sera allowed the unambiguous identification of the high molecular weight minor polypeptides present in purified IPNV demonstrating the presence of both VP1 and the polyprotein in purified virus preparations.",Immunology
7507055,"Etiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The natural history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) involves two phases. The first, or pathologic phase, is composed of two stages, microscopic and macroscopic, neither of which produces symptomatic clinical dysuria. Nearly all men throughout the world eventually develop microscopic BPH if they live long enough. In only about 50% of men, however, does microscopic BPH grow to produce a macroscopic enlargement of the gland, suggesting that additional factors are required for BPH progression. The second, or clinical, phase of BPH involves the progression of pathologic BPH to its clinical form, in which the patient develops symptomatic dysuria. Again, only about one half of the men with macroscopic BPH progress to clinical BPH. Although macroscopic enlargement of the prostate is necessary for the development of clinical BPH, it is usually not sufficient by itself for the progression to clinical BPH. Additional factors are required (e.g., prostatitis, vascular infarct, tensile strength of the glandular capsule). Successful treatment does not, therefore, require the prevention of pathologic BPH; instead, what is needed is a therapy to prevent or reverse the progression to clinical disease.",Immunology

The use of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and PET, recognized as an accurate tool for the specific diagnosis and staging of cancer, is currently being tested to monitor cancer therapy. Similar investigations have been performed with the nonPET markers 201Tl and 99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI), two markers of myocardial perfusion shown to concentrate in malignant cells. We have tested the hypothesis that the cellular incorporation of 201Tl and 99mTc-MIBI reflects that of FDG and correlates with treatment efficacy. We measured the incorporation in U937 cells of tritiated deoxyglucose (3H-DG), 201Tl and 99mTc-MIBI in basal conditions after stimulation or inhibition of the glucose metabolic pathway and after exposure to toxic agents selected to mimic the effects of chemotherapy. Thallium-201 or 99mTc-MIBI cell incorporation remained at basal levels after exposure to insulin, whereas 3H-DG cell incorporation was greatly enhanced. Conversely, in the presence of 50 microM of NaF for 3 hr, only 3H-DG cell incorporation was reduced to 57.2% +/- 6.2% from control conditions. Cycloheximide (CYX), metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and bleomycin (BLM) were added to cell cultures. Neither 201Tl nor 99mTc-MIBI followed the changes in cell incorporation observed with 3H-DG. In addition, only 3H-DG cell incorporation was inversely correlated to the time of cell exposure or to the cell culture concentration of MIBG and BLM. In this model, cell incorporation of 201Tl or 99mTc-MIBI differed from cell incorporation of 3H-DG suggesting that it was not directly related to cell glycolysis activity and cell injury. In conclusion, these results do not support the hypothesis that 201Tl or 99mTc-MIBI could replace FDG to monitor cancer treatment.",Immunology
7505606,"Visualisation and selective elimination of a subpopulation of mitogen-responsive bone marrow stromal cells using bromodeoxyuridine and photo-induced cell killing. Porcine bone marrow stromal cells (PBMSC) are a source of skeletogenic mesenchymal progenitor cells. Unfortunately, the heterogeneous nature of these cells in culture complicates the interpretation of their growth-factor responsiveness. We have therefore pulse-labelled mitogen-stimulated PBMSC with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in order to study individual, growth-factor responsive cells in the presence of large numbers of nonresponsive PBMSC. Transfer of growing cells to low serum medium reduced BrdU labelling from 35% to 4% over a period of 24 hours. Subsequent addition of foetal calf serum (FCS) to serum-arrested cultures increased the number of BrdU positive cells to 54% by 16 hours. Addition of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to serum-arrested cultures induced DNA synthesis in 28% of cell by 16 hours after stimulation. In order to selectively eliminate mitogen responsive cells from mixed cultures, BrdU-substituted cells were photosensitised with bisbenzimide and exposed to bright light. BrdU-labelled PBMSC died within 20-40 hours of bisbenzimide treatment and subsequent illumination, whereas BrdU-labelled cells survived in the dark despite treatment with bisbenzimide. The photokilling procedure appeared to have no long term effect upon the viability of non-BrdU-labelled cells because if subconfluent cells were brought to serum arrest prior to photokilling, no change in DNA content relative to controls was observed after a subsequent 4 or 7 day incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/10% FCS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology

A descriptive study was undertaken to document clinical and socio-demographic features and also to identify risk factors for mortality in children hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI). A total of 704 children aged from 1 month to 5 years admitted to Harare Central Hospital were studied. The peak age group was between 1 and 6 months. Seventy per cent of the children were found to have normal nutrition and 12% severe malnutrition. Seventy-eight per cent had severe and the remainder moderate ALRI (WHO classification). Clinical HIV infection was diagnosed in 219 (31%) children. One hundred and four children died, an overall case fatality rate (CFR) of 15%. In the clinically HIV-infected children, a CFR of 28% occurred, which constituted 60% of the overall ALRI mortality. A much lower CFR of 9% was found in the clinically non-HIV-infected children. Malnutrition, severe ALRI, age of 1 to 6 months, concurrent diarrhoea, duration of cough > or = 14 days and previous history of admission for ALRI were significant risk factors for mortality in ALRI. Low birthweight was not found to be a risk factor in this study. The impact of HIV infection on mortality in children with ALRI is of major concern in Zimbabwe and should be an important component of the national ALRI programme.",Immunology

Epitopes involved in the important functions, hemagglutination (HA) and neutralization (NT), were mapped on Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus proteins by using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Fourteen MAbs raised against Nakayama-Yoken strain of JE virus characterized by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) were used to map the epitopes on the JE proteins by Western blot analysis in which non-reducing conditions were used for sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). With these MAbs, at least 8 functional epitopes were demonstrated comprising (i) epitopes recognized by 5 MAbs which gave strong HI but weak NT activities and were mapped on the envelope (E) 53 kDa protein; (ii) epitopes recognized by 2 MAbs which showed weak HI but strong NT activities and were mapped also on the E protein; (iii) epitopes recognized by 2 MAbs which possessed weak HI but no NT activities and were mapped on the E protein; (iv) an epitope recognized by 1 MAb which gave weak NT and no HI activities and was mapped on the nonstructural protein 5 (NS5); (v) an epitope recognized by 1 MAb which showed activities similar to (i) but was mapped on both E and NS5; (vi) an epitope recognized by 1 MAb which had high activities to both HI and NT and was mapped on E and NS5; (vii and viii) epitopes recognized by 1 MAb which also gave low HI but high NT, and strong HI as well as strong NT activities respectively, but their location could not be demonstrated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing condition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology

7503551,"Mutagenesis and reversion analysis of residue Met-209 of the beta-subunit of Escherichia coli ATP synthase. Residue beta-Met-209 is conserved in all known F1-ATPase sequences, and the mutation beta M209I in Escherichia coli causes profound inhibition of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. Based on the properties of this mutant it had previously been proposed that residue beta-209 lies close to the site of catalysis. Two approaches were used to study this residue further. First, revertants were sought. Only wild-type and beta-Ser-209 were found; the Ser revertants involved a two-base change. Significantly, Ser is found at the equivalent position in the homologous vacuolar and archaebacterial ATPases. Second, all 20 natural amino acids were placed at position beta-209 by mutagenesis, and catalytic properties of the mutants were analyzed. The results showed that only a limited set of residues supported significant growth or ATPase activity, and that many of the mutations impacted severely on catalysis. X-ray structure analysis of the bovine enzyme has revealed that residue beta-Met-209 lies only 3.1. A from residue beta-Glu-181, which has been proposed to act as catalytic base. The results reported here emphasize that, in this discrete region of the catalytic site, specific stereo-chemical constraints on structure are critical for catalysis.",Immunology

Impaired wound healing in older individuals may result from a global deficit of fibroblast activity or a decreased response of aged fibroblasts to stimulation by inflammatory cytokines. Twenty-eight fibroblast cell strains were developed from normal human skin aged 3 days to 84 years. Mitogenic response to cytokines, epidermal growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, platelet-derived growth factor or fetal bovine serum was determined using a 4-hour 3H-thymidine incorporation assay. Synthesis of collagen and noncollagen proteins was determined basally and in response to transforming growth factor-beta using a 6-hour 3H-proline incorporation assay. Neither the mitogenic response to cytokine stimulation (p > 0.3) nor the synthesis of collagen and noncollagen protein after transforming growth factor-beta stimulation (p > 0.4) varied with the age of the cell donor. Individual cell lines' response to cytokine stimulation varied widely, reflecting differences commonly seen in patients' wound-healing abilities. Cellular responses to wound-healing cytokines are preserved as people age. Abnormalities in wound healing in older patients may be the result of altered immune initiation of healing or the cumulative result of concomitant disease.",Immunology

In the Western Pomerania region malignant lymphoma was diagnosed during that period in 528 subjects: low grade malignancy lymphomas were diagnosed in 268, therein lymphocytic lymphomas 135, with high grade malignancy 54: malignant granulomatosis 125 cases and 77 plasmocytic myelomas. The following data were taken into consideration: sex, place of residence, type of lymphoma: in case of malignant granulomatosis also the histopathologic subtype, and in multiple myeloma the type of monoclonal protein. Szczecin Voivodeship was found to have the highest incidence rate of malignant lymphoma, namely 9,1/10(5) of inhabitants: in Koszalin and Gorzów Voivodeships respectively 6.9/10(5) and 6.1/10(5) of inhabitants annually. The difference in the incidence rate in Szczecin Voivodeship and two other ones was significant (p < 0.001). No significant differences in the morbidity existed between Koszalin and Gorzów Voivodeships. In the region there was a preporderance of malignant lymphomas in relation to malignant granulomatosis. Morbidity in malignant lymphoma more frequently involved men than women. Morbidity rate of lymphoma with low and high malignancy, as well as plasmocytic myeloma increases with the age. On the other hand, in malignant granulomatosis no statistically significant differences depending on the age and sex were recorded. The incidence rate in respective groups of malignant lymphoma was the highest in Szczecin, followed by other towns in the region, being the lowest in rural environment.

7503410,"Long-term chemotaxis studies on adherent cells: effect of platelet-derived growth factor-BB on human vascular smooth muscle cell migration. Several chemotaxis methods have been developed which allow the study of different aspects of cell migration. The major limitation of such methods is the lack of a sustained chemotactic signal. Long-term chemotaxis phenomena which are known to take place in vivo have remained largely uninvestigated. Ways to maintain sustained chemotactic signals were sought and the used to investigate the long-term chemotactic effect of platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) on human vascular smooth muscle cells (HVSMC). PDGF-BB was adsorbed onto microcarrier beads and then embedded in agar. PDGF-BB diffusion was slow and a high and sustained local concentration was maintained in the agar. When PDGF-BB-loaded beads embedded in agar were placed at the edge of a tissue culture dish with HVSMC plated in the center, preferential movement was observed in the direction of the PDGF-BB source. This method was subsequently used to study directional movement of HVSMC arising from explants. This report demonstrates that PDGF-BB if present in an anisotropic concentration induces directional cell movement from such explants. By allowing the study of the effect of sustained chemotactic signals upon cultured cells or cells arising from explants, this method may provide a suitable model for investigating in vivo chemotaxis phenomena.",Immunology

Angiotensin II (ANG II) regulates whole kidney ion transport, yet its effects in the collecting duct are unknown. The purpose of these studies was to determine whether ANG II regulates luminal alkalinization and acidification in the rabbit cortical collecting duct (CCD). The rate of luminal alkalinization or acidification was measured as the rate of change of luminal fluid pH under stop-flow conditions using in vitro microperfused CCD segments. Outer CCD alkalinized the luminal fluid, consistent with net HCO3- secretion. Addition of ANG II, 10(-7) M, to the peritubular solution for 30 min significantly stimulated luminal alkalinization. The stimulatory effect of ANG II was not due to time-dependent effects and was blocked by peritubular addition of the ANG II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, losartan, at 10(-6) M. Losartan, 10(-6) M, when added to the peritubular solution, did not alter the rate of luminal alkalinization independent of ANG II. In contrast, peritubular ANG II, 10(-7) M, did not alter inner CCD luminal acidification. Addition of ANG II to the peritubular solution at the lower concentration of 10(-10) M did not alter the rates of luminal alkalinization and acidification in the outer and inner CCD, respectively. Peritubular ANG II, 10(-7) M, but not vehicle, stimulated B cell apical HCO3- secretion occurring in response to peritubular Cl- removal. These studies demonstrate that ANG II acts through a basolateral AT1 receptor to stimulate outer CCD luminal alkalinization via, at least in part, B cell stimulation.",Immunology
7503232,"Aquaporin-3 water channel localization and regulation in rat kidney. The aquaporins are a family of water channels expressed in several water-transporting tissues, including the kidney. We have used a peptide-derived, affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to aquaporin-3 (AQP-3) to investigate its localization and regulation in the kidney. Immunoblotting experiments showed expression in both renal cortex and medulla, with greatest expression in the base of the inner medulla. Subcellular fractionation of membranes, using progressively higher centrifugation speeds, revealed that AQP-3 is present predominantly in the 4,000 and 17,000 g pellets and, in contrast to AQP-2, is virtually absent in the high-speed (200,000 g) pellet that contains small intracellular vesicles. Immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence studies revealed that labeling is restricted to the cortical, outer medullary, and inner medullary collecting ducts. Within the collecting duct, principal cells were labeled, whereas intercalated cells were unlabeled. Consistent with previous immunofluorescence studies (K. Ishibashi, S. Sasaki, K. Fushimi, S. Uchida, M. Kuwahara, H. Saito, T. Furukawa, K. Nakajima, Y. Yamaguchi, T. Gojobori, and F. Marumo. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91: 6269-6273, 1994; T. Ma, A. Frigeri, H. Hasegawa, and A. S. Verkman. J. Biol. Chem. 269: 21845-21849, 1994), the labeling was confined to the basolateral domain. Immunoelectron microscopy, using the immunogold technique in ultrathin cryosections, demonstrated a predominant labeling of the basolateral plasma membranes. In contrast to previous findings with AQP-2, there was only limited AQP-3 labeling of intracellular vesicles, suggesting that this water channel is not regulated acutely through vesicular trafficking. Immunoblotting studies revealed that thirsting of rats for 48 h approximately doubled the amount of AQP-3 protein in the inner medulla. These studies are consistent with a role for AQP-3 in osmotically driven water absorption across the collecting duct epithelium and suggest that the expression of AQP-3 is regulated on a long-term basis.",Immunology

To determine the success and complication rates of ultrasonographically guided manual compression in patients with femoral arterial injuries after femoral arterial catheterization, we performed 53 sonographically guided compression repairs in 51 patients. Ultrasonographically guided compression repair was performed on 40 pseudoaneurysms in non-anticoagulated patients, seven pseudoaneurysms in anticoagulated patients, four arteriovenous fistulas on non-anticoagulated patients, and one pseudoaneurysm combined with an arteriovenous fistula. One pseudoaneurysm underwent two separate ultrasonographically guided compression repairs: once when the patient was anticoagulated and once after anticoagulants were withheld. Ultrasonographically guided compression repair was successful in 37 of 48 pseudoaneurysms (77%). Of the 40 pseudoaneurysms in non-anticoagulated patients, ultrasonographically guided compression repair was successful in 36 (90%). This repair technique failed in all seven pseudoaneurysms in anticoagulated patients.

The incidence and morphological characteristics of senile plaque and amyloid angiopathy in the cerebrum of six aged cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), 20 to 29 years old, were studied histopathologically and immunohistochemically. By periodic acid methenamine silver stain (PAM) and alkaline Congo red stain, senile plaques were detected in 5 out of 6 cases, and 3 of them were positive for amyloid in the wall of capillaries and arterioles in the cerebral cortex. Senile plaques were classified into three types. Mature plaques, including classical and primitive types, were more frequently observed than the immature diffuse type. Senile plaques were often seen in the cortex of temporal lobe, putamen and head of caudate nucleus. Since mature types of senile plaques were seen frequently around vascular amyloid deposition and no amyloid angiopathy was detected in the areas without senile plaques, the close relation between senile plaque of the mature type and amyloid angiopathy might be considered. All senile plaques and amyloid angiopathy were positively stained immunohistochemically with antibody against amyloid beta-protein (A beta P) 1-40 synthetic peptide, but all diffuse and some primitive plaques were negative for antibody against A beta P 8-17 synthetic peptide. Neither senile plaque nor amyloid angiopathy was detected in the cerebrum of 15 young monkeys, 9 to 11 years old, examined as controls.",Immunology

To investigate the relations among popular measures of neonatal stress and their link to subsequent temperament, 50 full-term newborns from a normal care nursery were examined responding to a heelstick blood draw. Baseline and heelstick measures of behavioral state, heart period, vagal tone, and salivary cortisol were obtained. Recovery measures of behavioral and cardiac activity were also analyzed. Mothers completed Rothbart's Infant Behavior Questionnaire when their infants reached 6 months of age. Baseline vagal tone predicted cortisol in response to the heelstick, suggesting that baseline vagal tone reflects the infants' ability to react to stressors. Greater reactivity to the heelstick (more crying, shorter heart periods, lower vagal tone, and higher cortisol) was associated with lower scores on ""Distress-to-Limitations"" temperament at 6 months. This finding was consistent with the expectation that the capacity to react strongly to an aversive stimulus would reflect better neurobehavioral organization in the newborn. Recovery measures of cardiac activity approximated and were correlated with baseline measures indicating the strong self-righting properties of the healthy newborn. Finally, vagal tone and salivary cortisol measures were not significantly related, suggesting the importance of assessing both systems in studies of the ontogeny of stress-temperament relations.",Immunology

The sequence processor (SP) is a small workstation computer that interfaces to the control computer of computer-controlled treatment machines, and to other parts of the larger CCRS system. The system reported here has been interfaced to a computer-controlled racetrack microtron with two treatment gantries, and also to other linear accelerator treatment machines equipped with multileaf collimators. An extensive design process has been used in defining the role of the SP within the context of the larger CCRS project. Flexibility and integration with various components of the project, including databases, treatment planning system, graphical simulator, were key factors in the development. In conjunction with the planned set of treatment fields, a procedural scripting language is used to define the sequence of treatment events that are performed, including operator interactions, communications to other systems such as dosimetry and portal imaging devices, and database management. A flexible system has been developed to allow investigation into procedural steps required for simulating and delivering complex radiation treatments. The system has been used to automate portions of the acceptance testing for the control system of the microtron, and is used for routine daily quality assurance testing. The sequence processor system described here has been used to deliver all clinical treatments performed on the microtron system in 2 years of clinical treatment (more than 200 patients treated to a variety of treatment sites).

Migraine and ischemia share an excessive release of neuroexcitatory amino acids. Inhibitory amino acids also may be implicated in both diseases. We investigated whether fluctuations of these amino acids occur in headache accompanying cerebral infarction. We studied 100 patients with infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. Neurological impairment was assessed using the Canadian Neurological Scale and Barthel Index. Size of infarction was determined with CT. Twenty-eight patients developed headache. Glutamate, aspartate, and taurine were quantified in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within 24 hours of stroke onset with cationic exchange chromatography. Stroke subtypes, size of infarct on CT, and clinical scales were similar in patients with and without headache. Plasma glutamate level was 321.14 +/- 149.53 mumol/L in patients with headache and 233 +/- 107.23 mumol/L in those without headache (P < .005). Glutamate in CSF was higher in patients with headache (4.6 +/- 1.49 mumol/L) than in patients without headache (3.11 +/- 1.18 mumol/L) (P < .001). Aspartate concentrations in plasma and CSF were similar in both groups.

In the present study, we standardized and compared a Dot-ELISA for IgM and IgG antibodies against S. mansoni antigens from eggs and worms with a routine IgG and IgM immunofluorescence assay using similar antigens, in the study of sera from 27 patients who had quantified egg stool excretion. The positivity obtained for IgG Dot-ELISA was 96.3% and 88.9% for IgM Dot-ELISA with worm antigen and 92.6% and 90.9% with egg antigen. The IFI presented similar positivities using worm antigen, 92.6% (IgG) and 96.3% (IgM), and lower results with egg antigen, 77.8%(IgG and IgM).

Despite the filtering effect of the lens, a secondary peak in spectral sensitivity to ultraviolet wavelengths was found. These results suggest that G. albogularis does possess the visual mechanisms for discrimination of the color pattern of conspecifics based on either hue or brightness. These findings are discussed in terms of the variation in coloration and social behavior of Gonatodes.",Immunology

The Filial Anxiety Scale (Cicirelli, 1988) was used in a cross-sectional design to assess whether the filial anxiety of adult caregivers of aging parents varied in a manner consistent with Blenkner's concept. Results clearly supported Blenkner's position that there is a late-in-life period of development during which some individuals experience heightened levels of filial anxiety, or a filial crisis, prompted by the caregiving demands of an aging parent. This crisis is then followed by a significant decrease in anxiety and results in the attainment of a developmental period characterized by filial maturity.",Immunology
7473157,"Inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary edema by isozyme-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors in guinea pigs. There is a need for pharmacological agents for the treatment of pulmonary edema associated with the adult respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, we examined the effects of isozyme-selective cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (cAMP PDE) inhibitors, as well as aminophylline and dexamethasone, on the pulmonary edema, protein leakage into the airways and airway neutrophilia induced by aerosolized lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in intact guinea pigs. Twenty-four hours after LPS exposure lung wet/dry weight ratios increased from 4.9 +/- 0.004 to 5.8 +/- 0.02. Rolipram (PDE4 selective), CI-930 (PDE3 selective), aminophylline and dexamethasone (given p.o. 1 hr before and 4 hr after LPS exposure) inhibited pulmonary edema formation with ED50 values of 1.7, 0.5, 31 and 2.8 mg/kg, respectively. Maximum inhibition occurred with rolipram at 10 mg/kg (70 +/- 17%), CI-930 at 10 mg/kg (101 +/- 4%), aminophylline at 50 mg/kg (88 +/- 14%) and dexamethasone at 3 mg/kg (64 +/- 6%). Denbufylline and milrinone also inhibited pulmonary edema formation at 10 mg/kg i.p., supporting the inhibition of PDE4 and PDE3 as the mechanisms of action of rolipram and CI-930, respectively. Rolipram, CI-930, aminophylline and dexamethasone (at maximum doses for inhibiting pulmonary edema) inhibited the 3-fold increase in bronchoalveolar lavage albumin concentration 24 hr after LPS exposure (42 +/- 14%, 98 +/- 2%, 70 +/- 9% and 53 +/- 13%, respectively). However, none of these compounds (at maximum doses for inhibiting pulmonary edema) inhibited the corresponding 400-fold increase in lavage neutrophil counts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology
7473032,"Stereotype threat and the intellectual test performance of African Americans. Stereotype threat is being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group. Studies 1 and 2 varied the stereotype vulnerability of Black participants taking a difficult verbal test by varying whether or not their performance was ostensibly diagnostic of ability, and thus, whether or not they were at risk of fulfilling the racial stereotype about their intellectual ability. Reflecting the pressure of this vulnerability, Blacks underperformed in relation to Whites in the ability-diagnostic condition but not in the nondiagnostic condition (with Scholastic Aptitude Tests controlled). Study 3 validated that ability-diagnosticity cognitively activated the racial stereotype in these participants and motivated them not to conform to it, or to be judged by it. Study 4 showed that mere salience of the stereotype could impair Blacks' performance even when the test was not ability diagnostic. The role of stereotype vulnerability in the standardized test performance of ability-stigmatized groups is discussed.",Immunology

Long-term follow-up examination with esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed on seven patients who had undergone successful delayed anastomosis for isolated esophageal atresia. The follow-up period ranged from 1.2 to 11.3 years (mean, 5.3). All patients had undergone fundoplication because of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux (GER). Three anastomotic strictures had to be resected. At the time of the last follow-up examination, the subjective results were excellent for five patients and good for two. The last endoscopy showed macroscopic esophagitis in three and normal mucosa in four. The fundoplication was partly disrupted in two patients. In three patients the fundoplication was competent but partly intrathoracic. Histological examination showed moderate esophagitis in one, mild esophagitis in one, and normal mucosa in five patients; however, four patients were on continuous medication for esophagitis. In conclusion, the subjective results of patients with isolated esophageal atresia treated with esophageal anastomosis are good. However, long-term complications caused by GER are common in these patients. Therefore, active search and treatment of reflux is necessary for these patients.",Immunology

A fetal lamb model of amniotic band syndrome (ABS) was developed to study the pathophysiology of banded extremities and evaluate the possibility of in utero treatment with the potential for functional recovery. Eight fetal lambs underwent banding of their extremities with umbilical tape at 100 days' gestation. Two lambs aborted after the open fetal surgery. The limbs of two unoperated newborn lambs served as controls in addition to five sham-operated control limbs that had no bands applied. Nine limbs were banded without reducing blood flow assessed by laser doppler (group 1), and 6 limbs were similarly banded and released fetoscopically at 125 days' gestation. Four limbs were banded, with a mean reduction in blood flow to the limb of 18.7% (group 2) by laser doppler flowmeter. Shortly after birth the lambs were killed, and segmental limb length, circumference, joint range of motion, and histology were evaluated. At birth, banded limbs showed marked brawny edema and absence of wool distal to the band. Segmental limb measurements showed shorter distal forelimbs in banded limbs compared with controls (10.97 +/- 0.59 versus 12.98 +/- 0.69, P < .05). Banded limbs were associated with progressive increase in hoof circumference (P < .03) and a decrease in joint range of motion (P < .003). In sharp contrast, there were no differences between fetoscopically released limbs and control limbs in any of the parameters measured. Histology of banded extremities showed edema, venous and lymphatic congestion, and fibrosis compared with controls. This model of ABS in fetal lambs is simple, reproducible, and replicates all the clinical features of extremity ABS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology

Fundoplication remains a common operation in the brain-damaged pediatric patient, but recent reports suggest a poor outcome in these patients. The factors that might be associated with complications or recurrence after fundoplication have not been extensively examined. Fifty-six brain-damaged children, aged 6 months to 12 years, with documented gastroesophageal (GE) reflux underwent preoperative nutritional evaluations (percentage of ideal weight, albumin, nutrition risk index [NRI]) and documentation of medications (dexamethasone for bronchopulmonary dysplasia) before standard Nissen fundoplication. Hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and time on ventilator, as well as major postoperative complications (wound infection/dehiscence, pneumonia) were prospectively analyzed. Survival and recurrence rates 1 to 3 years postoperatively were also assessed. Eighty-two percent of patients were < 90% ideal weight, and 50% had NRI < 90 (normal = 100) and 29% had albumin < 3.5 g/dL. Albumin < 3.5 was significantly (P < .01) associated with prolonged hospitalization (26.8 + 2.2 versus 15.1 + 1.1 days) and ICU stay (13.8 + 1.0 versus 4.4 + .5 days) and time on ventilator (8.0 + 1.0 versus 1.8 + .4 days). NRI < 90 showed similar significant differences (P < .01). Ideal body weight < 90% was not significant.

The sensitivity of an antigen detection enzyme immunoassay (Ag-ELISA) based on a Trypanosoma brucei group-specific monoclonal antibody was evaluated to detect circulating Trypanosoma evansi antigen in horse sera. Three horses and 2 mules were experimentally infected with T. evansi. Circulating antigens were detected on 7 and 21 days postinfection. Antigen levels increased during the course of the illness and remained high even when parasitemia was low or when parasites could not be detected. Antigens were cleared from serum when drug treatment was effective but persisted when it was not. In 6 outbreaks of ""mal de caderas"" involving 125 horses, T. evansi was found in 78 horses using standard parasite detection methods and antigenemia was detected in 58 of them (74%). The Ag-ELISA sensitivity rate varied between 63% and 100% for the 6 different outbreaks. A combination of Ag-ELISA and parasitologic methods diagnosed a total of 93 infected animals.

In a sample of 30 partially edentulous subjects, provided with an immediate complete upper denture and a partial lower denture and followed for 2 years, a correlation analysis was performed between facial morphology, as measured by lateral head films, and EMG peak mean voltages of the anterior temporal and masseter muscles when clenched and during swallowing and chewing, and of the lip muscles during swallowing. At the pre-treatment stage, when the patients occluded on a residual anterior dentition, correlations between facial morphologic characteristics and peak mean voltages of the jaw closing muscles indicated stronger muscle activity in individuals with a square facial type. No significant associations were observed between muscle activity and the age of the subjects, which ranged from 36 to 71 years. After placement and use of the dentures a significant forward-upward rotation of the mandible with a decrease in overbite occurred, as a result of resorption of the edentulous maxillary ridge. At the 1 year stage of denture use, the elevator activity showed no significant correlations with facial morphology. On the other hand, negative correlations were observed especially between the anterior temporal activity and anterior overbite. Similar negative correlations were observed for the lip activity during swallowing, especially of the upper lip. These findings suggest occlusal contact between the incisors during the various functions in subjects with a small overbite. The findings further suggest that the anterior temporal and the upper lip muscles are sensitive to changes in anterior occlusal relations of the dentures.",Immunology

Farnesyl-pyrophosphate is required for the posttranslational modification of G proteins including p21 ras, prelamin A and lamin B, each of which plays an essential role in cell proliferation. As a consequence, competitive inhibitors of mevalonate synthesis, the rate-limiting substrate for the synthesis of the prenyl-pyrophosphates, arrest cultured cells at the G1/S interface of the cell cycle and initiate apoptotic cell death. Geraniol, an acyclic monoterpenoid alcohol, suppresses 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity and concomitantly arrests the growth of cultured tumor cells.

The authors tested the hypothesis that anesthetic agents may affect cerebrovascular responses to ethanol. A closed cranial window preparation in the rat was used to compare the response of pial arterioles to topically applied ethanol (0.01% to 1% vol/vol) in the presence of alpha-chloralose/urethane (50 and 600 mg/kg, respectively) or halothane (0.5% to 1%) anesthesia. Heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, and blood gas levels were maintained stable and within the physiological range throughout each experiment. Ethanol induced significant vasoconstriction in alpha-chloralose/urethane-anesthetized animals (multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), p = 0.039); conversely, ethanol induced significant vasodilation of the pial arterioles in halothane-anesthetized animals (MANOVA, p = 0.017). These responses were significantly different from one another (MANOVA, p = 0.001). Thus, the choice of anesthetic agent alters the cerebrovascular response to ethanol, and care should be taken to ascertain the influence of anesthesia in both research and clinical settings.",Immunology

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection of the nervous system is frequent in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and can be responsible for encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, meningoradiculitis or polyradiculo-neuropathy. Encephalitis is characterized at microscopy by its periventricular and cerebellar location, and by the presence of cytomegalic cells, containing intranuclear and/or intracytoplasmic inclusions, microglial nodules and necrotic foci. The virus can infect almost all types of cells. Coexistence of CMV and HIV has been observed in giant cells of macrophagic origin. It has been suggested that the two viruses could act in synergy. The nervous system is seldom infected by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in AIDS. The infection can be responsible for multifocal leukoencephalitis, ventriculitis, vascular lesions associated or not with cerebral infarction, or with meningomyeloradiculitis. In almost all cell types Cowdry's type A intranuclear inclusions have been found. The virus can be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization.

7472464,"PDGFs protect hippocampal neurons against energy deprivation and oxidative injury: evidence for induction of antioxidant pathways. Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) and PDGF receptors are expressed in brain, where their functions are largely unknown. We tested the hypothesis that PDGFs play a role in promoting the survival of neurons exposed to metabolic and oxidative insults. Exposure of rat and mouse hippocampal cell cultures to glucose-deficient medium or the hydroxyl radical-promoting agent FeSO4 resulted in progressive neuronal loss. Pretreatment of cultures with PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB resulted in highly significant attenuation of glucose deprivation- and FeSO4-induced neuronal degeneration. In each injury paradigm the neuroprotective actions of the PDGFs were concentration dependent (3-100 ng/ml). In the case of glucose deprivation, significant protection was seen when cells were exposed to PDGFs prior to, or up to 8 hr following, the onset of glucose deprivation. Pretreatment with PDGFs was required for protection against FeSO4-induced oxidative injury. Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses demonstrated that cultured embryonic hippocampal neurons expressed both PDGF alpha- and beta-receptors. PDGFs induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins including a band at 180 kDa, the molecular weight of PDGF receptors. Induction of peroxide accumulation in neurons by FeSO4 was attenuated in cultures pretreated with PDGFs, suggesting that PDGFs enhanced cellular antioxidant mechanisms. Measurements of anti-oxidant enzyme activities in control and PDGF-treated cultures showed that both PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB increased both catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities, and PDGF-AA also increased superoxide dismutase activities. These findings suggest that PDGFs, which are widely expressed in brain and induced in response to injury, may play roles in protecting neurons against metabolic and oxidative insults.",Immunology

Various amounts of paraquat (10(-5) to 10(-12) g) in 0.1 ml saline were instilled directly into the left bronchus of male adult rats. Gravimetric, macroscopic, and microscopic studies on the left lobe of the lung showed that 10(-5) g of paraquat produced lung oedema and macroscopic lesions two and 14 days after doing. The pathology of the lung was similar to that seen after systemic poisoning. When 10(-6) g of paraquat was instilled, some animals developed lung oedema and macroscopic lesions. Microscopic examination showed subtle changes in the parenchyma of the lung. With amounts of paraquat equal to or less than 10(-7) g (doses as little as 10(-12) g were used), no changes in the lung were seen. This is contrary to published accounts in which amounts as low as 10(-12) g (1 Pg) were reported to cause acute damage to the rabbit lung. When 3H paraquat was instilled into the left lobe (doses of 10(-5) to 10(-10) g were used), the loss of paraquat from the lung was biphasic. The initial half-life was less than one hour. The secondary phase obeyed first-order kinetics, and the half-life was dependent on the dose of paraquat instilled. This half-life was as short as 11 hours when 10(-5) g paraquat was instilled and was 76 hours after the instillation of 10(-10) g paraquat. The decrease in the half-life of the secondary phase with increasing doses of paraquat is possibly associated with the production of oedema or lung cell damage, or both. After the instillation of 10(-8) g 3H paraquat, the initial half-life was less than 15 minutes, and paraquat was detected in the urine and plasma at that time. This suggests that 50% of the instilled paraquat was rapidly absorbed from the lung into the plasma.",Immunology

The influence of preventive treatment with a low dose of carbon tetrachloride on paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity was evaluated in the rat. The haloalkane was given intraperitoneally (200 microliter/kg) 48 hours prior to paracetamol (PRCT; 2000 mg/kg, os). In parallel groups of rats were treated with CCl4 or PRCT alone. Twelve hours after paracetamol all the animals were killed. Liver damage was determined by evaluating total lipid and triglyceride accumulation in hepatic tissue and the serum activity of alanine-amino transferase (S.GPT). In addition, both the hepatic concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH) and the production ""in vitro"" of TBA-reacting compounds by liver homogenate were assayed. The results obtained indicate CCl4 ""per se"" induces a significant triglyceride accumulation but does not influence either the hepatic GSH level or the leakage of GPT into the blood stream. In addition, the haloalkane does not stimulate the production of TBA-reacting substances by hepatic tissue. Paracetamol, alone, produces a slight increase of hepatic triglycerides while induces a significant (+ 108%) enhancement of S.GPT activity. The drug is also able to stimulate the lipid peroxidation ""in vitro"", whereas provokes a marked decrease of GSH in liver tissue. Combined treatment with the two poisons results in a minor alteration of hepatocyte function as shown by the lack of GPT in serum and by the reduced fall of hepatic GSH as well as by a decreased production of TBA-reacting compounds. In our opinion, CCl4 partially protects against paracetamol-induced liver injury by interacting with enzymes which are responsible for the biotransformation of PRCT to a reactive arylating species that bind to cell molecules.",Immunology

The accuracy of this simple and rugged method was well within NIOSH recommendations and the method could be used to determine concentrations well below 0.1 ppm using 1-4L/min personal sampling pumps for less than 10 minute sampling or 0.05-0.20 L/min pumps for sampling over 3 hours.",Immunology

To elucidate the relationship between heart rate (HR) and left ventricular ejection time (LVET) during early exercise, 30 patients with chest pain were studied at 1 (1') and 4 minutes (4'). Mean results for control leads to 1' exercise: HR 79 to 105 beats per minute, LVET 247 to 260 msec. Thus instead of shortening as predicted by the HR change at 1' of exercise, LVET rose significantly (p less than 0.001). Subsequently LVET fell as HR continued rising, and by 4' had fallen toward control level. This phenomenon is comparable to the paradoxical decline in LVET as HR decreases early post-exercise and is comparably explained by transiently disproportionate change in determinants of LVET, stroke volume, and ejection rate. Absence of difference in response of exercise-positive (ST depression greater than or equal to 1 mm) and exercise-negative patients, also supports this initial paradoxical lengthening in LVET as a physiologic response.",Immunology
7468417,"The creatine kinase curve area and peak creatine kinase after acute myocardial infarction: usefulness and limitations. We determined creatine kinase (CK) curve areas in 112 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Two-hour sampling was performed for the first 24 hours or until peak CK was reached, and a gamma density function was used to calculate curve areas from all available samples. Attempts to predict CK curve area by means of the portion of the curve prior to peak CK proved to be inaccurate; not until values 2 hours or more beyond peak CK were utilized did predicted and actual CK areas agree well. A good correlation (r = 0.93) was found between CK area and peak CK. To establish an approach for detecting peak CK in the clinical setting, a range of sampling intervals (4 to 24 hours) was assessed; 4- and 6-hour sampling intervals for 48 hours produced maximum CK values at or above 85% of true peak CK in 90% and 89% of patients, respectively, and average maximum CK at both sampling intervals exceeded 94% of that obtained with 2-hour samplings. We conclude that this simplified approach can provide a basis for estimating infarct severity in the individual patient.",Immunology

It was found that the cerebellum contained the highest amounts of ATP, ADP and total adenine nucleotides, while the lowest values were detected in the medulla oblongata. There were no statistically significant difference in the distribution of AMP, although its concentration tended to be highest in the medulla oblongata. The snake-headed fishes were shown to have the highest amounts of ATP, ADP and AMP in the brain.

One bill defined death to permit the withdrawal of life supports; the other permitted the cessation of active treatment when demanded by terminal patients. Members of the Medical Association of the State of Alabama (MASA) in practices permitting independent action in such cases composed the sample. Twenty percent of 1,300 questionnaires were returned. Most participants idealistically resented legislative interference but realistically were resigned to or welcomed legal clarification of physicians' rights and responsibilities. Respondents encountering demands for life-support withdrawal generally acceded, usually after consultation with family and/or colleagues.

7507965,"A role for lectin interactions during human neutrophil aggregation. We have recently reported that neutrophil aggregation is dependent on both L-selectin and the beta 2-integrin Mac-1, raising the possibility that carbohydrate interactions play a role in aggregation. We used mono- and polysaccharides known to inhibit L-selectin-dependent adhesion of lymphocytes to high endothelial venules to test whether these carbohydrates could inhibit neutrophil aggregation. Similar types and concentrations of carbohydrates found by others to inhibit lymphocyte adhesion were effective in blocking neutrophil aggregation. Thus, nanomolar concentrations of the polysaccharides dextran sulfate (m.w. 500,000) and fucoidan inhibited aggregation, whereas dermatan sulfate, alpha-carrageenan, and dextran sulfate (m.w. 5,000) showed no inhibition. All of the phosphorylated monosaccharides tested inhibited aggregation with ED50 values between 8 and 17 mM, the most potent being mannose-6-phosphate and fucose-1-phosphate. The nonphosphorylated monosaccharides glucose and fucose were noninhibitory. The inhibitory effects of fucoidan or dextran sulfate (m.w. 500,000) did not appear to be due to altered regulation of L-selectin after stimulation because fucoidan reduced the rate of L-selectin shedding, whereas dextran sulfate had no effect compared with control. Neither carbohydrate inhibited the binding of formyl peptide to its receptor. However, carbohydrates were able to compete with mAb binding to a number of known leukocyte adhesion proteins. We used endotoxin pretreatment to create L-selectin-deficient neutrophils to study the minimum adhesive requirements for aggregation using two-color fluorescence flow cytometry. Our results implicate a lectinlike contribution to neutrophil aggregation, and suggest that L-selectin is the molecule that mediates the carbohydrate-dependent adhesive event.",Immunology

The superficial temporal artery was anastomosed to the cortical artery of the parietal MCA segment. The MCA was exposed and trapped for 40 minutes during barbiturate infusion, with electroencephalographic and somatosensory evoked potential monitoring. During MCA trapping, the aneurysm was collapsed by dome puncture and obliterated by neck clipping. After surgery, she had only mild amnestic aphasia and an infarct in the medial temporal lobe demonstrated by computed tomography. However, cerebral angiography disclosed complete occlusion of the MCA by the displaced aneurysm clip, and perfusion of the distal MCA segments through the anastomosis.

The pharmacodynamic profiles of methotrexate (MTX) and 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin (10-EdAM) were determined in three head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines. Cell growth inhibition was tested using a semi-automated 96-well based proliferation assay, the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Drug concentrations ranged from 10(-5) to 10(-9) M, with exposure periods of 4, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hr. The SRB-test was performed after each of these periods of continuous exposure and after an additional period of 24 and 48 hr in drug-free medium. Without a drug-free period the IC50 values strongly depended on the time of exposure. For example, with respect to MTX, IC50 values at 24 hr ranged from 2.9 (UM-SCC-14C) to over 10 microM (UM-SCC-22B and -11B), but when exposed continuously for 96 hr, IC50 values varied between 0.039 and 0.1 microM. 10-EdAM followed a similar sensitivity pattern with 5-20-fold lower IC50 values. The minimal time to achieve significant growth inhibition varied between the cell lines, < 24 hr for UM-SCC-14C, > 24 and > 48 hr for UM-SCC-11B and -22B, respectively. The cell lines also varied with respect to growth behaviour when placed in drug-free medium for an additional period. Growth of UM-SCC-14C cells was recovered significantly after removing the drug, whereas UM-SCC-22B showed a different pattern: when cultured for over 48 hr, cell growth was strongly inhibited, independent of the drug being removed. This variable pattern of sensitivity could be correlated with the capacity of the cells to form polyglutamate derivatives. After 24 hr, drug accumulation was at least three times lower in UM-SCC-14C than in both other cell lines. The low level of antifolate accumulation in UM-SCC-14C is in line with the recovery from growth inhibition at culture in drug-free medium, while the persistent growth inhibition observed in UM-SCC-22B agrees with the intracellular accumulation of higher polyglutamates. In conclusion, these experiments show that the pharmacodynamic profile varies between HNSCC cell lines and plays an important role in the growth inhibition by antifolates. Both exposure time and the intrinsic capacity to synthesize polyglutamates are important factors in the sensitivity of HNSCC to antifolate drugs.",Immunology
7505843,"Selective expression of foreign genes in glioma cells: use of the mouse myelin basic protein gene promoter to direct toxic gene expression. We have previously demonstrated that retrovirus-mediated genes were transferred to mouse glioma cells in a meningeal gliomatosis model (Yamada et al.: Japanese Journal of Cancer Research 83:1244-1247, 1992). This retrovirus vector contains the Escherichia coli. beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) gene as a marker for integration of the lacZ gene, which is controlled by the SV40 early promoter. We investigated whether lacZ genes could be specifically controlled in mouse glioma cells by glial-specific promoters, including the 2.5 kb 5' flanking region of the mouse glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene, the 1.3 kb 5' flanking region of the myelin basic protein (MBP) gene, and the 1.5 kb 5' flanking region of the myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) gene. Psi-2 packaging cells were transfected with each retrovirus vector (GFAP promoter-, MBP promoter-, and PLP promoter-lacZ) and the infectious virus particles were recovered from the supernatants. Blue staining for beta-gal was detected in various fibroblast, myeloma, and glioma cell lines transduced with the retrovirus BAG vector. On the other hand, blue staining was only detected in glioma cells after transduction with the lacZ gene-bearing retrovirus controlled by glial-specific promoters. The strongest promoter activity was detected after transduction with the retrovirus in which the MBP promoter controlled the lacZ gene. Mouse glioma cells transduced with retrovirus containing the MBP promoter directing the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HTK) gene were extremely sensitive to ganciclovir, while the parental cells and cells transduced with retrovirus containing the lacZ gene were not sensitive to ganciclovir.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology

Nonselective cation channels have been found in various parts of the nephron and represent a heterogeneous group of channels. We briefly review their putative physiological function.

In some renal epithelia cGMP seems to be involved in the regulation of nonselective cation channels. Furthermore, there is evidence that a gene related to the cGMP-gated photoreceptor channel, a well-characterized, nonselective cation channel, is also expressed in whole rat kidney tissue. In the context of these observations, we review recent findings from our own work on a nonselective cation channel in the M-1 mouse cortical collecting duct cell line.

The frequency of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon 4 allele and its relationship with coexistent Parkinson's disease (PD) neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not been extensively explored. We determined ApoE genotype in 100 dementia patients with neuropathologically confirmed AD with and without concomitant Parkinson's disease (PD) changes (nigral degeneration and Lewy bodies at various sites). Fifty ""AD+PD"" patients were matched closely with 50 ""pure AD"" patients for age, sex, and duration of dementia. We found identical overrepresentation of the epsilon 4 allele in the two groups: 72% of the patients in each group had at least one ApoE epsilon 4 allele, compared with approximately 25% in the general population (p < 0.005) and in our institutional autopsy population (p < 0.001). Age at onset varied inversely with epsilon 4 allele dosage in men but not in women in both the AD and the AD+PD groups. As with amyloid deposition and plaque frequency in AD, we observed an association between epsilon 4 dosage and PD-related changes. Specifically, the severity of ubiquitin-positive neuritic change in CA2/3 of the hippocampus, but not the frequency of cortical Lewy bodies, varied significantly with epsilon 4 dosage in the AD+PD cases.",Immunology
7500954,"Hyperspeckled mutants of Schizosaccharomyces pombe: frequent mating-type switching without detectable double-strand breaks. Mating-type (MT) switching in homothallic (h90) strains of Schizosaccharomyces pombe is initiated by a DNA double-strand break (DSB) at the distal end of the expression cassette mat1. The cis-acting smt-s1 mutation C13-P11 reduces the frequency of MT switching. It is a small deletion mapping approximately 50 bp distal to the site of the DSB. From the h90 smt-s1 strain we isolated 13 mutants with a hyperspeckled iodine reaction. In these mutants the frequency of MT switching is increased. The mutations define nine different hsp genes, none of which maps in or close to the MT region. We tested one mutant of each gene for the presence of DSBs at mat1. Curiously, in none of the h90 smt-s1 hsp strains could DSBs be detected, although some sporulate nearly as efficiently as the h90 smt-n wild type. The hsp mutations show no effect in smt-0 strains; the smt-0 deletion abolishes MT switching completely. Furthermore, we tested the interaction of hsp1-1 with swi1, swi2 and swi7 mutations. hsp1-1 has no effect in swi2 strains, whereas it increases MT switching in swi7 and, to a lesser degree, in swi1 mutants.",Immunology
7500944,"Structural genes for salicylate biosynthesis from chorismate in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Salicylate is a precursor of pyochelin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and both compounds display siderophore activity. To elucidate the salicylate biosynthetic pathway, we have cloned and sequenced a chromosomal region of P. aeruginosa PAO1 containing two adjacent genes, designated pchB and pchA, which are necessary for salicylate formation. The pchA gene encodes a protein of 52 kDa with extensive similarity to the chorismate-utilizing enzymes isochorismate synthase, anthranilate synthase (component I) and p-aminobenzoate synthase (component I), whereas the 11 kDa protein encoded by pchB does not show significant similarity with other proteins. The pchB stop codon overlaps the presumed pchA start codon. Expression of the pchA gene in P. aeruginosa appears to depend on the transcription and translation of the upstream pchB gene. The pchBA genes are the first salicylate biosynthetic genes to be reported. Salicylate formation was demonstrated in an Escherichia coli entC mutant lacking isochorismate synthase when this strain expressed both the pchBA genes, but not when it expressed pchB alone. By contrast, an entB mutant of E. coli blocked in the conversion of isochorismate to 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate formed salicylate when transformed with a pchB expression construct. Salicylate formation could also be demonstrated in vitro when chorismate was incubated with a crude extract of P. aeruginosa containing overproduced PchA and PchB proteins; salicylate and pyruvate were formed in equimolar amounts. Furthermore, salicylate-forming activity could be detected in extracts from a P. aeruginosa pyoverdin-negative mutant when grown under iron limitation, but not with iron excess. Our results are consistent with a pathway leading from chorismate to isochorismate and then to salicylate plus pyruvate, catalyzed consecutively by the iron-repressible PchA and PchB proteins in P. aeruginosa.",Immunology

7500877,"Measurement of fluid-shear rate by Fourier-encoded velocity imaging. A new technique for estimating the blood fluid shear rate at the vessel wall is presented. The technique uses Fourier-encoded velocity imaging to determine the velocity distribution within a spatial element (voxel) that straddles the blood-vessel wall interface. By appropriate processing, the velocity distribution (1) can determine the location of the wall-blood interface within the voxel and (2) estimate the velocity profile across the spatial extent of the voxel. From this information, accurate estimates of fluid shear rate may be obtained. Simulations are presented to illustrate this technique and to show the effects of various error sources, including differences in proton densities between blood and wall tissues and flow-related signal changes. Experimental evidence obtained for steady flow in straight tubes is also presented in support of the technique. The mean error in the experimental shear rate estimates found using the proposed technique was -15%. This represents a significant improvement over estimates obtained by extrapolation of the velocity profile over multiple voxels (mean error of -73%).",Immunology

Lipomatous uterine masses are uncommon hyperechoic pelvic neoplasms composed partly of adipose tissue. Because of the high level of echogenicity, these uterine masses can produce produce a sonographic appearance strikingly similar to the ""dermoid plug"" that is considered characteristic of benign cystic teratomas. The key to distinguishing the two tumors is to ascertain the parent organ: the lipomatous uterine mass should clearly originate from the myometrium. In our experience, however, the origin of some echogenic pelvic masses can be difficult to determine, particularly from the endovaginal perspective. This report describes the transabdominal and endovaginal ultrasonographic findings in three patients with lipomatous uterine masses for whom the endovaginal perspective alone, without supplemental transabdominal views, would have resulted in misdiagnosis.",Immunology

In recent years there has been an increased interest in the use of oligonucleotides as therapeutic agents. Oligonucleotide therapeutics may have significant potential over traditional drugs due to their high degree of specificity and increased affinity. The major drawbacks to the use of oligonucleotide therapeutics are the problems associated with their delivery and their relative instability in serum. The serum instability problem has been partially overcome through the use of oligonucleotides with modified backbones. Transdermal electrotransport may be used to overcome the problems associated with delivery.

7500025,"Oncostatin M induces association of Grb2 with Janus kinase JAK2 in multiple myeloma cells. Oncostatin M (OSM) is a 28-kD glycoprotein recently identified as a growth factor for human multiple myeloma cells. It belongs to a family of distantly related cytokines that includes interleukin 6, ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia-inhibitory factor, and interleukin 11. These cytokines initiate signaling by inducing either homodimerization of gp130 or heterodimerization of gp130 with leukemia-inhibitory factor receptor beta components. Such dimerization in turn activates receptor-associated tyrosine kinases. In the present study using U266B1 human multiple myeloma cells, we show that OSM induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of JAK2, but not JAK1 or Tyk2, kinases. The results also demonstrate that OSM induces direct interaction of JAK2 kinase with Grb2, an SH2/SH3 domain containing adaptor protein. The SH2 domain of Grb2 is directly associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated JAK2. Furthermore, the presence of Sos in the JAK2-Grb2 complex suggests a role for Ras in OSM-transduced signaling.",Immunology
7500012,"Molecules from Staphylococcus aureus that bind CD14 and stimulate innate immune responses. Mammals mount a rapid inflammatory response to gram-negative bacteria by recognizing lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin). LPS binds to CD14, and the resulting LPS-CD14 complex induces synthesis of cytokines and up-regulation of adhesion molecules in a variety of cell types. Gram-positive bacteria provoke a very similar inflammatory response, but the molecules that provoke innate responses to these bacteria have not been defined. Here we show that protein-free, phenol extracts of Staphylococcus aureus contain a minor component that stimulates adhesion of neutrophils and cytokine production in monocytes and in the astrocytoma cell line, U373. Responses to this component do not absolutely require CD14, but addition of soluble CD14 enhances sensitivity of U373 cells by up to 100-fold, and blocking CD14 on monocytes decreases sensitivity nearly 1,000-fold. Deletion of residues 57-64 of CD14, which are required for responses to LPS, also eliminates CD14-dependent responses to S. aureus molecules. The stimulatory component of S. aureus binds CD14 and blocks binding of radioactive LPS. Unlike LPS, the activity of S. aureus molecules was neither enhanced by LPS binding protein nor inhibited by bactericidal/permeability increasing protein. The active factor in extracts of S. aureus is also structurally and functionally distinct from the abundant species known as lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Cell-stimulating activity fractionates differently from LTA on a reverse-phase column, pure LTA fails to stimulate cells, and LTA antagonizes the action of LPS in assays of IL-6 production. These studies suggest that mammals may use CD14 in innate responses to both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, and that gram-positive bacteria may contain an apparently unique, CD14-binding species that initiates cellular responses.",Immunology
7499968,"Vitamin E supplementation with interferon-gamma administration retards immune dysfunction during murine retrovirus infection. Murine retrovirus infection induces loss of vitamin E and immune dysfunction with loss of cytokine production by T-helper cells. Therefore interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was given during dietary vitamin E supplementation to effectively prevent murine retrovirus-induced immunosuppression, cytokine dysregulation, and development of murine AIDS. Administration of IFN-gamma during vitamin E supplementation significantly prevented development of retrovirus-induced suppression of splenic natural killer cell activity and T cell proliferation. It also significantly slowed retrovirus-induced elevation of T helper (Th) 2 cytokine [interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-10] production and monokine (IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) secretion by splenocytes. The treatment also prevented loss of Th1 cytokine (IL-2 and IFN-gamma) secretion by splenocytes from retrovirus-infected mice alleviating splenomegaly and hypergammaglobulinemia. The combined therapy had an additive therapeutic impact. It was more effective than IFN-gamma treatment or vitamin E supplementation alone in delaying the development of retrovirus-induced immunosuppression with its cytokine dysregulation.",Immunology
7499873,"Oligoclonality of lung T lymphocytes following exposure to allergen in asthma. We were interested in studying the lung allergen-specific T cell repertoire in different conditions of allergen exposure in subjects with atopic asthma. Twenty-one allergic individuals were studied: 17 subjects suffering mainly from asthma and 4 from rhinitis. They all performed spirometry and methacholine challenge. All patients were subjected to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), either at base line (no challenge) or after allergen or histamine challenge, and the TCR repertoire of their lung T cells was studied with heteroduplex analysis. Expansion of single T cell clones was observed in one (of seven) asthmatic subject that reported a recent exposure to allergen and had high bronchial hypersensitivity to methacholine, and in seven/seven asthmatic subjects who underwent BAL after they suffered an early asthmatic reaction to experimental allergen inhalation. Remarkably, ex vivo expanded clones included allergen-specific T cells. In two of the seven subjects who underwent BAL after allergen challenge, two different lung segments were lavaged. A strikingly symmetrical distribution of the expanded clones was found in these samples. Control subjects and six of seven asthmatic patients studied at base line showed polyclonality of lung T cells. In conclusion, T lymphocytes are clonally expanded in the lower respiratory tract only in asthmatic subjects exposed to allergen. These results suggest that in allergic asthma, the inhalation of sensitizing allergens can recruit to the lung T lymphocytes that include allergen-specific T cell clones.",Immunology
7499592,"Lipoteichoic acid inhibits remineralization of artificial subsurface lesions and surface-softened enamel. Dental plaque produces not only acids by which underlying enamel is demineralized but also compounds which may inhibit repair of the lesions. The aim of this study was to determine how lipoteichoic acid, a bacterial compound that is abundant in dental plaque and inhibits calcium phosphate precipitation in vitro, affects the remineralization of incipient enamel lesions. Subsurface and surface-softened lesions were made in thin sections of bovine enamel, incubated with various amounts of lipoteichoic acid (isolated from Lactobacillus casei), and remineralized in 1.5 mmol/L CaCl2, 0.9 mmol/L KH2PO4, 130 mmol/L KCl, and 20 mmol/L Hepes, pH 7.0. Remineralization was followed during several weeks by repeated microradiography of the sections, and characterized by the changes in the integrated mineral loss of the lesions and the differential mineral profiles. The results showed that: (1) the effects of lipoteichoic acid on lesion remineralization were dose-dependent; (2) in subsurface lesions only the highest dose of lipoteichoic acid affected remineralization, which was delayed throughout the lesions; and (3) in surface-softened enamel, lipoteichoic acid did not affect the remineralization of the deeper parts, but remineralization of a surface zone of from 25 to 30 microns was increasingly inhibited with increasing doses. These effects were explained by different permeabilities of the surfaces of both types of lesions for the inhibitor: In subsurface lesions, lipoteichoic acid may have mainly clogged the porosities in the surface layer, whereas it could penetrate substantially into surface-softened enamel.",Immunology

The kinematic center of the temporomandibular condyle is that condylar point which follows as much as possible the same movement path during different types of mandibular movements. In this study, the location of the kinematic center with respect to the palpated lateral pole of the condyle was investigated. Also, the lengths of the condylar movement path reconstructed by means of the kinematic center and the palpated condyle were compared. Mandibular movements were recorded with 6 degrees of freedom in 20 healthy subjects. A software procedure calculated the location of the kinematic center as that mandibular point for which the protrusive and opening movement path showed a minimal difference. For each subject, its average location was calculated on the basis of 16 pairs of protrusive and opening movements. The kinematic center was located posteriorly and superiorly with respect to the palpated condylar point (p < 0.0001). The standard deviation in the anterior-posterior coordinate of the average kinematic center was smaller than that in the superior-inferior coordinate (p < 0.0001). During opening, the path length of the kinematic center is longer than that of the palpated lateral pole of the condyle (p < 0.0001). In contrast to left-right differences found in the path lengths of the lateral pole of the condyle, no left-right differences were found for the kinematic center.",Immunology
7499585,"Effect of growth hormone on the distribution of decorin and biglycan during odontogenesis in the rat incisor. Previous studies have shown that growth hormone can influence the expression of N-acetylgalactosamine-containing molecules in the extracellular matrix of developing rat incisors. N-acetylgalactosamine is a principal component of proteoglycans containing chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate, as well as of some glycoproteins. Since chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are identifiable components in enamel, dentin, and cementum, we have tested the hypothesis that growth hormone modulates their expression in developing rat incisors. The distribution of the chondroitin-sulfate-rich proteoglycans, decorin and biglycan, was investigated. We used the Lewis dwarf rat as a model because their circulating growth hormone levels are markedly reduced. Polyclonal antibodies against decorin and biglycan were used to localize these two proteoglycans. Semi-quantitative assessments of the staining patterns and intensities were made for each proteoglycan within compartments of the developing teeth. In normal Lewis rats, decorin and biglycan differentially expressed throughout the enamel organ, dental papilla, and dental follicle. Decorin displayed a wide distribution throughout all three regions and was closely associated with different cellular components. In contrast, biglycan showed little association with cells and was identified in the predentin and osteoid matrices. The expression of both proteoglycans was dramatically decreased in the growth-hormone-deficient animals. Administration of growth hormone to the dwarf rats markedly elevated the expression of both proteoglycans, approximating the distribution and intensity of staining seen in normal animals. These findings confirm that growth hormone status can modulate the expression of decorin and biglycan, and hence matrix deposition, in the rat tooth.",Immunology

7499557,"Time-course of neuropeptide changes in peri-ischemic zone and amygdala following focal ischemia in rats. Previously, using a middle cerebral artery occlusion model in Wistar rat, we showed autonomic disturbances similar to those seen clinically and observed striking neurochemical changes in cortical and subcortical sites at 5 days following stroke. The neurochemical changes may account for functional recovery and/or autonomic disturbances after focal ischemia. To understand the possible mechanisms and to facilitate future studies, it is necessary to define the time-courses of these changes. Using immunohistochemical staining with the peroxidase-antiperoxidase reaction, the changes in several neuropeptides over the peri-ischemic region and the ipsilateral central and basolateral nucleus of the amygdala were investigated at different times after middle cerebral artery occlusion. In the experimental group, neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity appeared to increase by 6 hours in the peri-ischemic region. Using image analysis to quantify the staining intensity, the change became statistically significant at 1 day, peaked around 3 days, and subsided at 10 days. There was a delayed increase in neuropeptide Y in the ipsilateral basolateral nucleus of the amygdala with a peak around 3 days. Immunoreactive staining for leucine-enkephalin, dynorphin, and neurotensin demonstrated an increase that was localized to the ipsilateral central nucleus of the amygdala with a peak around 3 days and a return to baseline levels by 10 days. The results support a specific time-course for each of the neuropeptides studied and indicate that a survival time of 3 days after focal ischemia is the critical period for examining the relationship between neuropeptide responses and neuronal or functional recovery.",Immunology
7499548,"Nerve growth factor prevents apoptotic cell death in injured central cholinergic neurons. Experimental lesions have been widely used to induce neuronal degeneration and to test the ability to trophic molecules to prevent lesion-induced alterations, but these studies have not demonstrated unequivocally that afflicted neurons die as a result of these manipulations. The documentation of neuronal death in the above-described models and the time when it occurs after injury are crucial for the interpretation of trophic effects. In the present study, we combined multiple approaches to investigate the nature of retrograde neuronal changes in cholinergic neurons of the medial septal nucleus (MSN) after complete, unilateral transection of the fimbria-fornix (F-F). Projections neurons of the MSN were prelabeled with the fluorescent tracer Fluoro-gold (FG) 1 week prior to lesion. By counting both FG-labeled and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-immunoreactive neurons in the MSN at multiple time points postaxotomy, we differentiated the phenotypic response to injury from the degenerative process and established a critical time between the third and fourth weeks postaxotomy, during which approximately 50% of fluorescent perikarya disappear. Working in the previous time window, we identified dying cells by electron microscopy (EM) and terminal transferase-mediated (TdT) deoxyuridine triphosphate (d-UTP)-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) and showed that MSN neurons die via apoptosis, beginning at 16 days postaxotomy. An additional group of animals was allowed to survive for 1 month (i.e., 10 days after cell death has been completed); during this period, animals were treated with intraventricular nerve growth factor (NGF). Quantitative analysis of surviving cholinergic perikarya showed that NGF prevented degeneration of the majority of neurons. In concert, the results of the present study establish that NGF does not merely protect the phenotype but also prevents cell death in lesioned central cholinergic neurons.",Immunology
7499544,"Development of the chiasm of a marsupial, the quokka wallaby. We have previously shown that the mature optic chiasm of a marsupial is divided morphologically into three regions, two lateral regions in which ipsilaterally projecting axons are confined and a central region containing only contralaterally projecting axons. By contrast, in the chiasms of eutherian (placental) mammals studied to date, there is no tripartite configuration. Ipsilaterally and contralaterally projecting axons from each eye are mixed in the caudal nerve and in each hemichiasm and encounter axons from the opposite eye near the midline of the chiasm. Here, we show that, unlike eutherians, marsupials have astrocytic processes in high concentrations in lateral regions of the nerve and rostral chiasm. Early in development, during the period when optic axons are growing through the chiasm, many intrachiasmatic cells are seen with densities five to eight times higher in lateral than in central chiasmatic regions. Such cells continue to be added to all chiasmatic regions; later in development, considerably more are added centrally, as the chiasm increases in volume. In the mature chiasm, cell densities are similar in all regions. By contrast to the marsupial, cell addition in the chiasm of a placental mammal, the ferret, is almost entirely restricted to later developmental stages, after axons have grown through the chiasm, and there are no obvious spatial variations in the distribution of cells during the period examined. During development, similar to the adult marsupial, ipsilaterally projecting axons do not approach the chiasmatic midline but remain confined laterally. We propose that the cells generated early and seen in high densities in the lateral chiasmatic regions of the marsupial may play a role in guiding retinal axons through this region of pathway selection. These data suggest that there is not a common pattern of developmental mechanisms that control the path of axons through the chiasm of different mammals.",Immunology

The single CS was deeper (9.7 +/- 0.81 mm) than in cases with double parallel sulci (7.5 +/- 0.48 mm). There were dimples parallel to the CS in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anastomoses between the CS and the superior CS.

The relationship between retrogradely labelled or intracellularly filled phrenic motoneurons and varicosities containing thyrotropin-releasing hormone immunoreactivity was investigated in rats by light and electron microscopy. Phrenic motoneurons were identified via retrograde tracing from the diaphragm with cholera toxin B subunit, which was followed by immunocytochemistry to visualise retrogradely labelled motoneurons and thyrotropin-releasing hormone-immunoreactive nerve fibres in their vicinity. At the light microscopic level, varicose thyrotropin-releasing hormone-immunoreactive nerve fibres were distributed sparsely in the phrenic motor nucleus, with some axons surrounding retrogradely labelled motoneurons. In separate intracellular experiments, four phrenic motoneurons identified by antidromic activation from the C5 phrenic nerve root were subsequently filled with Neurobiotin, and nerve fibres that contained thyrotropin-releasing hormone immunoreactivity were identified by immunocytochemistry. The numbers and locations of thyrotropin-releasing hormone-immunoreactive varicosities that were closely appeared to the intracellularly labelled motoneurons were mapped using a camera lucida technique. Close appositions by thyrotropin-releasing hormone-immunoreactive varicosities were seen on somata as well as on proximal and distal dendrites. The closely apposed varicosities were usually present in tight clusters, which were formed by single varicose axons. However, the distribution was nonuniform, in that some dendrites did not receive any close appositions. Ultrastructural analysis of random ultrathin sections through retrogradely labelled neurons showed that varicosities with thyrotropin-releasing hormone immunoreactivity made 1.8% of all synapses and direct contacts on somata and 2.3% of synapses and contacts with dendrites of the retrogradely labelled phrenic motoneurons. The results of these experiments suggest that thyrotropin-releasing hormone-immunoreactive varicosities provide similar numbers of inputs to both the somata and dendrites of phrenic motoneurons. These thyrotropin-releasing hormone-containing inputs seen via light and electron microscopy could modulate the excitability of phrenic motoneurons.",Immunology
7499524,"Developing mossy fiber terminal fields in the rat cerebellar cortex may segregate because of Purkinje cell compartmentation and not competition. Many mossy fiber afferent projections to the rat cerebellar cortex terminate in parasagittal bands. In particular, the anterior lobe vermis of the cerebellum contains alternating bands of mossy fibers from the spinal cord and external cuneate nuclei. The cerebellar cortical efferents, the Purkinje cells, are also organized in parasagittal bands. These can be revealed by immunochemical staining for the antigen zebrin II, which is selectively expressed by bands of Purkinje cells. In some cases, the boundaries between mossy fiber terminal fields align with identified transitions between zebrin+/- sets of Purkinje cells, whereas others are located within apparently homogeneous Purkinje cell compartments. Two theories can explain the terminal-field topography: In one view, mossy fiber terminals segregate during development, because growth cones from different sources compete for common territory. Alternatively, mossy fiber growth cones directly recognize chemically distinct target territories, and activity-dependent mechanisms play only minor roles. To explore these issues, two sets of experiments were performed. First, the terminal-field map of the neonatal spinocerebellar projection was compared to the Purkinje cell compartmentation as revealed by anticalbindin immunocytochemistry. Second, subsets of spinocerebellar mossy fiber afferents were ablated early in postnatal development, and the consequences for the neighboring cuneocerebellar terminal fields were mapped in the adult with reference to the zebrin II+/- compartments. These experiments revealed no evidence that competitive interactions constrain the mossy fiber terminal-field distribution but, rather, suggest that the organization of the mossy fiber projections follows the compartmentation of the Purkinje cells.",Immunology

Effects of increased hydrostatic pressure (range 0.1-10 MPa) on isometric twitch and tetanic contractions of single intact muscle fibres, isolated from frog tibialis anterior muscle, were examined at 4-12 degrees C. The tension changes produced on exposure to steady high pressures are compared with those produced on exposure to low concentrations of caffeine (0.5 mM, subthreshold for contracture) and when pressure is rapidly released during a contraction. The peak twitch tension was potentiated by pressure accompanied by increased rate of tension rise and increased duration; the pressure sensitivity of twitch tension was approximately 8% MPa-1. The correlation between the rate of tension rise and peak tension in caffeine-induced twitch tension potentiation was quantitatively similar to that in pressure-induced twitch potentiation. Experiments involving the rapid release of pressure (approximately 2 ms) during twitch contractions demonstrate that high pressure need only be maintained for a brief period during the early part of tension development to elicit full twitch potentiation. The tetanic tension was depressed by pressure (approximately 1% MPa-1). Results demonstrate that the major effect of increased hydrostatic pressure on intact muscle fibres, which results in tension potentiation, is complete very early during contraction and is similar to that of caffeine.",Immunology
7499275,"Both the amino and carboxyl termini of Dictyostelium myosin essential light chain are required for binding to myosin heavy chain. Dictyostelium myosin deficient in the essential light chain (ELC) does not function normally either in vivo or in vitro (Pollenz, R. S., Chen, T. L., Trivinos-Lagos, L., and Chisholm, R. L. (1992) Cell 69, 951-962). Since normal myosin function requires association of ELC, we investigated the domains of ELC that are necessary for binding to the myosin heavy chain (MHC). Deleting the NH2-terminal 11 or 28 amino acid residues (delta N11 or delta N28) or the COOH-terminal 15 amino acid residues (delta C15) abolished binding of the ELC to the MHC when the mutants were expressed in wild-type (WT) cells. In contrast, the ELC carrying deletion or insertion of four amino acid residues (D4 or I4) in the central linker segment bound the MHC in WT cells, although less efficient competition with WT ELC suggested that the affinity for the MHC is reduced. When these mutants were expressed in ELC-minus (mlcE-) cells, where the binding to the heavy chain is not dependent on efficient competition with the endogenous ELC, delta N28 and delta N11 bound to the MHC at 15% of WT levels and delta C15 did not bind to a significant degree. I4 and D4, however, bound with normal stoichiometry. These data indicate that residues at both termini of the ELC are required for association with the MHC, while the central linker domain appears to be less critical for binding. When the mutants were analyzed for their ability to complement the cytokinesis defect displayed by mlcE- cells, a correlation to the level of ELC carried by the MHC was observed, indicating that a stoichiometric ELC-MHC association is necessary for normal myosin function in vivo.",Immunology
7498263,"LCB 2183 inhibits tracheal hyperreactivity and pulmonary inflammation in mouse airways. The pulmonary delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction induced by picryl chloride is characterized by enhanced albumin concentration in the airway tissue in the early phase (2 h after challenge with picryl sulphonic acid). During the later phase (48 h after the challenge) enhanced tracheal reactivity to carbachol in vitro and cellular (mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leukocytes) accumulation into the airway tissue in vivo are prominent features. In this present study, the effects of a novel drug, LCB 2183, were examined in the pulmonary DTH reaction. LCB 2183 (25 mg/kg twice daily intragastric gavage) failed to inhibit the enhanced albumin accumulation in the early phase of this response. In contrast, LCB 2183 abolished the tracheal hyperreactivity and the leukocyte accumulation in the airways of picryl chloride-sensitized mice 48 h after the challenge. These results demonstrate that LCB 2183 could be effective in the treatment of airway hyperreactivity and pulmonary inflammation.",Immunology
7496206,"[Maintenance of the relation between the pulsed secretion of hormones and the internal sleep structure in human African trypanosomiasis]. In order to determine whether sleep disturbances would affect the hormonal patterns and the normal relationships between hormone pulses and sleep stages, the 24-hour profiles of cortisol, prolactin and plasma renin activity (PRA) were analysed in 6 sleeping sickness patients studied at Brazzaville and in 5 healthy African controls studied in Abidjan. Polysomnographic recordings were done continuously and blood was taken every 10 minutes throughout the 24-hour period. Plasma was analyzed for cortisol, prolactin and PRA. The circadian rhythm of cortisol, considered as an example of an endogenous rhythm was attenuated in all the patients but one, but as in normal subjects, slow wave sleep (SWS) remained associated with the declining phases of the secretory episodes. Prolactin and PRA profiles, which are strongly influenced by the sleep-wake cycle did not show the increase normally associated with long sleep periods and reflected the spreading of sleep and wakefulness throughout the 24-hour period. However, rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep began in sleeping sickness patients, as in normal subjects, during the descending phases of prolactin pulses. In both groups, PRA reflected the sleep stage distribution with non rapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep occurring during the ascending phases and REM sleep during the descending phases of the oscillations. However, in sleeping sickness patients, the marked sleep fragmentation often did not allow sufficient time for PRA to increase significantly, as observed with regular NREM-REM sleep cycles. These results demonstrate that, together with the disruption of the sleep-wake cycle, there are profound differences in the temporal organization of the 24 hour hormone profiles in human African trypanosomiasis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology
7493030,"A mutation in the mucosal keratin K4 is associated with oral white sponge nevus. White sponge nevus (WSN) is a benign autosomal dominant disorder which affects non-cornifying stratified squamous epithelia (MIM 193900) (ref. 1). Phenotypically it presents as white 'spongy' plaques (oral leukokeratoses), most commonly in the mouth but also reported in the esophagus and anogenital mucosa. Histologically, the plaques show evidence of hyperproliferation, acanthosis and tonofilament aggregation. These types of pathogenic changes are characteristic of many of the epidermal keratin disorders. Keratins are expressed in pairs by epithelial cells in a tissue and cell specific manner. The major differentiation specific keratins of the buccal mucosa, nasal, esophageal and anogenital epithelia are K4 and K13 (ref. 7). The tissue distribution and nature of the lesions in patients affected by WSN suggested that mutations in K4 and/or K13 might be responsible for this disorder. We have now confirmed this hypothesis and report here a three base-pair (bp) deletion in the helix initiation peptide of K4 in affected members from two families with this condition.",Immunology
7493029,"M6P/IGF2R gene is mutated in human hepatocellular carcinomas with loss of heterozygosity. The mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II receptor (M6P/IGF2R) functions in the intracellular trafficking of lysosomal enzymes, the activation of the potent growth inhibitor, transforming growth factor beta 2, and the degradation of IGF2 (ref. 1), a mitogen often overproduced in tumours. We have recently shown that 70% of human hepatocellular tumours have loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the M6P/IGF2R locus which maps to chromosome 6q26-q27 (ref. 8). Using a coarse screen, we have now identified point mutations in the remaining allele of 25% of human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) with LOH. These mutations give rise to truncated receptor protein and significant amino acid substitutions, and provide evidence that the M6P/IGF2R gene functions as a tumour suppressor in human liver carcinogenesis.",Immunology

The opioid dynorphin-A (dynA) is thought to contribute to the secondary injury process following spinal cord trauma although little is known about the biochemical mechanisms involved. In the present study, we have used a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) and hindlimb motor function tests to examine the effects of intrathecal dynA infusion on rat spinal cord. Infusion of 100 nmol of dynA (1-17) caused pronounced edema development as determined by MRI at 24 h after infusion. Infusion of 100 nmol of the dynA (2-17) fragment, which does not have any activity at opiate receptors, also produced profound edema whereas 100 nmol of the low potency kappa opiate receptor ligand dynA (1-8) or artificial CSF (ACSF) did not produce any edema. Both dynA (1-17) and dynA (2-17) produced significant hindlimb motor deficits at 24 h when compared to dynA (1-8) and ACSF (P < 0.05), but the deficits in the dynA (1-17) group were significantly worse than in the dynA (2-17) treated animals (P < 0.05). Similarly, mortality in the dynA (1-17) treated animals was significantly higher than in the other groups (P = 0.002). Phosphorus MRS demonstrated that the dynA (1-17) and dynA (2-17) treated animals also had a pronounced decline in high energy phosphates in the spinal cord 24 h after infusion. We conclude that dynA contributes to spinal cord cell death by causing metabolic failure and edema development.",Immunology
7492938,"Behçet's disease: epidemiology and eye manifestations in German and Mediterranian patients. Behçet's disease (BD) is a systemic disease of unknown etiology, characterized by multiple organ involvement. Although its incidence is high in the Mediterranean countries and in Japan, BD is not often found in German patients. We therefore compared the epidemiological and clinical involvement of BD in 39 patients of German and of Mediterranean origin. The first manifestation was oral aphthosis in 72% of patients, followed by eye involvement (62%), skin lesions (25%), and arthritic problems (23%). Eventually, all our patients developed oral aphthosis. Whereas Germans had eye involvement in only 55% of cases (Mediterraneans, 71%), they came up with venous thrombosis or thrombophlebitis more often (64%) as compared with Mediterraneans (29%). The first ocular symptom was anterior uveitis in 87.5% of patients; the visual prognosis was poor due to occlusive retinopathy. Among 22 eyes of 12 patients, 16 had a visual acuity of 0.1 or less after 5 years of disease. We found a similar association with human leukocyte antigen B5 (HLA-B5) in the German patients (66.7%) and in the Mediterranean group (54.4%). There was no significantly higher HLA-B5 association with the uveitis or arthritis type. These results demonstrate a few differences between the two ethnic groups but illustrate that in Germans the disease also has a poor prognosis.",Immunology

The concern that use of talc or talc-containing substances in the perineal region of women may subject them to an increased risk for ovarian cancer has become an important issue in the study of ovarian cancer. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether this concern, heightened by several epidemiological studies purporting to show an increased risk, is valid. Epidemiological studies examining the possibility of this relationship are reviewed, and meta-analyses of their results are performed. The conclusion reached herein is that the evidence regarding the risk of ovarian cancer associated with talc exposure is equivocal, and further examination of the relationship is required before a sound conclusion can be made.",Immunology

Clinical isolates Enterococcus gallinarum AIB39 and E. gallinarum GS1 were studied to establish whether the expression of vanC-1-mediated resistance may be inducible or constitutive. By growth curve analysis, strain AIB39 exhibited the same lag period (i.e., 1 to 1.5 h) whether it was subcultured to unsupplemented brain heart infusion broth or broth containing 6 micrograms of vancomycin per ml, a growth pattern typical of constitutively expressed resistance. Use of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to separate peptidoglycan precursor extracts substantiated this finding because the serine-terminating pentapeptide precursor UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ser was produced in the presence and absence of vancomycin, whereas no UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala was detected. In contrast, results with strain GS1 were consistent with inducible expression. GS1 demonstrated a lag time that was 3 to 4 h longer when it was subcultured to vancomycin-containing broth than when it was subcultured in unsupplemented broth. HPLC analysis showed that in the absence of vancomycin only UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala was detected, but in the presence of drug only UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala was found. Inducible expression of vanC-1-mediated resistance in E. gallinarum is consistent with recent findings suggesting the presence of at least two ligases in this species. Although vanC-1 may be intrinsic to E. gallinarum, our findings raise doubt regarding the natural mechanism of this gene's expression.",Immunology

The undescended inferior parathyroid gland is a well-established although infrequent embryologic abnormality resulting in an ectopically located gland usually associated with thymic tissue and is found most commonly within the carotid sheath at the level of the carotid bifurcation. Embryologically undescended superior glands (either normal or enlarged), clearly above the level of the upper pole of the thyroid gland and found within or in approximation to the lateral pharyngeal wall, have not been previously described. The locations of all parathyroid glands at the time of cervical exploration were carefully examined as to embryologic origin in a combined experience of more than 3000 patients with primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism. Five patients had enlarged abnormal glands located within or in close approximation to the pharyngeal wall. All were above the upper pole of the thyroid gland. Two were identified at reoperation on the basis of localization studies. One gland was found after resection of a massive concomitant cervical goiter. The other two were found after an extensive search for a superior gland. Undescended superior glands are extremely rare (0.08%). They are located within or in approximation to the pharynx above the level of the thyroid gland with an unusual blood supply, which supports an embryologic rather than acquired cause for their ectopic location.",Immunology

7490992,"Neurodegeneration and diabetes: UK nationwide study of Wolfram (DIDMOAD) syndrome. Wolfram syndrome is the association of diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy, and is sometimes called DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness). Incomplete characterisation of this autosomal recessive syndrome has relied on case-reports, and there is confusion with mitochondrial genome disorders. We therefore undertook a UK nationwide cross-sectional case-finding study to describe the natural history, complications, prevalence, and inheritance of the syndrome. We identified 45 patients with Wolfram syndrome--a prevalence of one per 770,000. Non-autoimmune, insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus presented at a median age of 6 years, followed by optic atrophy (11 years). Cranial diabetes insipidus occurred in 33 patients (73%) with sensorineural deafness (28, 62%) in the second decade; renal-tract abnormalities (26, 58%) presented in the third decade followed by neurological complications (cerebellar ataxia, myoclonus [28, 62%]) in the fourth decade. Other abnormalities included gastrointestinal dysmotility in 11 (24%), and primary gonadal atrophy in seven of ten males investigated. Median age at death (commonly central respiratory failure with brain-stem atrophy) was 30 years (range 25-49). The natural history of Wolfram syndrome suggests that most patients will eventually develop most complications of this progressive, neurodegenerative disorder. Family studies indicate autosomal recessive inheritance with a carrier frequency of one in 354, an absence of a maternal history of diabetes or deafness, and an absence of the mitochondrial tRNA Leu (3243) mutation. Juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy are the best available diagnostic criteria for Wolfram syndrome, the differential diagnosis of which includes other causes of neurodegeneration.",Immunology

We evaluated the impact of epilepsy surgery on seizures, medication use, employment, and the quality of life in 248 adults and adolescents consecutively referred to one medical centre between 1974 and 1990. Outcomes were determined through self-administered questionnaire and medical record review for 202 surgery and 46 non-surgery patients whose treatment was usually determined by the presence or absence of an epileptogenic focus. Surgery and non-surgery patients differed at baseline only in median monthly seizure frequency (surgery lower than non-surgery). After adjustment for baseline covariates, surgery patients at follow-up had greater decline in average monthly seizure frequency (-11.9 vs - 1.5; difference -10.4, 95% CI -20.5, -0.3) and took fewer antiepileptic medications (average number 1.4 vs 2.0; difference -0.67, 95% CI -0.94, -0.40). Although quality-of-life scores were higher (p < 0.05) with surgery on 5 of 11 scales that were administered only at follow-up, there were no significant differences in employment status or prospectively assessed quality of life. Relative to a non-surgery group, patients treated surgically had better seizure control with less antiepileptic medication.

7490533,"Regulation of glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion from rat ileum by neurotransmitters and peptides. Food ingestion induces a rapid increase in the insulinotropic glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in plasma. Paradoxically, GLP-1 originates from the lower intestines and therefore a complex regulation of postprandial GLP-1 secretion must exist. This was addressed in the present study by utilizing an isolated vascularly perfused rat ileum preparation. Peptides and neurotransmitters thought to be candidate mediators triggering GLP-1 secretion were arterially infused and GLP-1 was measured in the venous effluent. Arterial infusion of cholinergic agonists strongly enhanced GLP-1 secretion which was counteracted by the addition of atropine. Histamine, dopamine, 5-hydoxytryptamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and norepinephrine had no effect. Peptides of the bombesin family were strong stimulants whereas tachykinins, enkephalins, dynorphin, TRH, calcitonin-gene-related peptide and members of the secretin family, vasoactive intestinal peptide, peptide histidine isoleucine and neuropeptide Y, were less effective. The second incretin hormone, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), was the most potent stimulant of GLP-1 secretion in our study. It enhanced GLP-1 release up to sixfold above basal during the early phase followed by a sustained secretion at 400% above basal. This stimulation remained unaffected by atropine. In conclusion, in addition to luminal stimulation of nutrients, a cholinergic impulse as well as peptidergic mediators (among them possibly GIP and GRP) may have an impact on postprandial GLP-1 secretion from the rat ileum.",Immunology
7490531,"Tumour necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma and dexamethasone regulate IGF-I-maintained collagen production in cultured human fibroblasts. We examined the effects of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) on the production of collagen by human infant foreskin fibroblasts. Collagen synthesis was maintained in the presence of IGF-I so that cytokine effects could be examined in the absence of serum. TNF alpha inhibited IGF-I-maintained collagen production in a dose-dependent manner. Maximal suppression of 50% was attained at a concentration of 7.5 ng/ml. IFN gamma also suppressed collagen accumulation in IGF-I-maintained cells, with a maximal inhibition to 55% at 375 U/ml. The rate of collagen formation relative to total protein production for secreted proteins was calculated. This value decreased from 10.3% for IGF-I-cultured cells to 6.2% and 8.4% with the inclusion of TNF alpha and IFN gamma respectively, indicating that inhibition was selective for collagen. TNF alpha (5 ng/ml) and IFN gamma (250 U/ml) together suppressed IGF-I-maintained collagen production to approximately 35%, with a decrease from 10.3% to 2.9% in collagen production relative to total protein. The inclusion of a serum-free period prior to the addition of TNF alpha to the cultures resulted in a further inhibition to 15% of control. This increase in inhibition was not seen if dexamethasone was present in the serum-free period prior to cytokine addition. These data showed that IGF-I-maintained collagen formation is suppressed by the proinflammatory cytokines TNF alpha and IFN gamma, and that these interactions are influenced by dexamethasone. Proinflammatory cytokines interact in a complex manner with other serum factors to modulate IGF-I-stimulated extracellular matrix production and may have important roles in regulating tissue repair.",Immunology

We have recently described a NUDE/SCID mouse model that has been useful for the study of human thyroid autoimmunity in in vivo conditions. The reappearance of lymphocytic infiltration in Graves' thyroid tissue and a humoral response in SCID mice (rexenografted with normalized thyroid tissues from NUDE mice) was detected only if autologous Graves' human peripheral lymphocytes (PBMC) were engrafted into the same animals. Therefore it was presumed that some autoreactive PBMC directed themselves to the thyroid. However, there was previously no direct evidence regarding the trafficking of the engrafted PBMC to the target tissue. To elucidate this point we have studied the migration of 51Cr-labeled PBMC in SCID mice. Human thyroid tissue from six Graves' disease (GD) patients and six patients with nontoxic nodular goiter were initially xenografted into NUDE mice for 8 weeks. The same tissues were retrieved and rexenografted into several ""virgin"" SCID mice, i.e., no previous xenografts. Autologous PBMC were isolated from blood of the same patients obtained at the time of the tissue rexenograftment and labeled with radioactive 51Cr. Twenty million labeled PBMC were engrafted into each SCID mouse. The distribution of labeled lymphocytes into mouse organs and trafficking into Graves' and normal xenografts was measured. A significant amount of radioactivity in Graves' xenografts was detected after 1 week with the peak of radioactivity at 2-3 weeks. This radioactivity was significantly higher than radioactivity in surrounding tissues (skin, muscle). In contrast, homing of autologous lymphocytes into normal paranodular thyroid tissue was very minimal; the radioactivity of GD thyroid xenografts with engrafted autologous lymphocytes was significantly higher than that of normal tissues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology

The sex, age, site, and mechanism of injury, associated injury, and treatment methods for children admitted to the Albany Medical Center Hospital with orbital fractures between July 1986 and June 1992. Fourteen children had fractures of the orbital roof, 10 children had fractures of the orbital floor, 14 children had mixed fractures, and two children had fractures of the medial wall. The mean age (4.8 +/- 3.3 years) of the 14 patients with roof fractures was significantly less than the mean age (12.0 +/- 4.2 years) of the 26 children with other orbital fractures. Logistic regression demonstrated that the age at which the probability of lower orbital fractures exceeds the probability of orbital roof fractures is 7.1 +/- 1.0 years. Orbital roof fractures had a significantly greater likelihood of associated neurocranial injuries. The need for surgical repair was significantly lower among children with roof fractures as well as among children 7 years of age and younger. Orbital roof fractures are a type of skull fracture that occur primarily in younger children as a consequence of the proportionally larger cranium and the lack of frontal sinus pneumatization. Lower orbital fractures are a type of facial fracture that occur primarily in older children as a consequence of the increased vulnerability of the face due to growth and the pneumatization of the paranasal sinuses.",Immunology

Immunization procedures that induce contact sensitivity to the trinitrophenyl (TNP) hapten in vivo were investigated for their ability to induce TNP-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vivo. Spleen cells from C3H/HeN mice primed for CS responses either by the topical application of picryl chloride or by the adoptive transfer of PCL immune cells show little or no cytolytic activity in vitro against TNP-coupled target cells. Intravenous immunization with TNP-substituted syngeneic spleen cells, a procedure known to make animals unresponsive to agents normally inducing CS, also failed to induce cytolytic activity in spleen cells. However, both PCL sensitization and adoptive transfer, when combined with the injection of TNP-substituted syngeneic spleen cells, induce significant cytolytic activity against TNP-haptenated BW5147 target cells in vitro. Furthermore, i.v. injection of TNP-spleen cells with surface-bound immune complexes of the IgM or IgG1 isotypes, or with a monoclonal TNP-specific contrasuppressor T cell factor also induces strong antigen-specific cytolytic activity against TNP modified targets. TcsF bears serological determinants of T cell receptor alpha and beta chains and adheres to specific antigen columns. All these immunization regimens were shown to induce CS to TNP as well as the generation of contrasuppressor T cells. The CTL generated in the spleens of immunized mice are Thy1+ CD8+ T cells an are antigen-specific and genetically restricted.

Review of pediatric ED use and charges for gastrointestinal illness during the epidemic and during a control period. Pediatric ED in Seattle, Washington. All children seen in the ED with a gastrointestinal illness during the epidemic period (January and February 1993) and during a control period (January and February 1992). During the epidemic, 31 patients with E coli O157:H7 infection had 45 visits to the ED. The number of visits for gastrointestinal illness not caused by E coli O157:H7 was 103% higher in the epidemic period than in the control period (653 in 1992, 1,327 in 1993). The number of visits was closely associated with the number of newspaper stories about E coli O157:H7 illness (correlation coefficient, .88; P = .002). The increased number of evaluations for gastrointestinal illness not caused by E coli O157:H7 infection during the epidemic period was associated with an additional $101,193 in charges per month compared with the control period. There were no important differences in the evaluation of gastrointestinal illness between 1992 and 1993 except for an increase in the proportion of patients with stool cultures (13.1% versus 26.4%, P < .001). For every visit by a patient with E coli O157:H7 infection, there were 15 additional visits (above the baseline from the control period) by patients with other gastrointestinal illness. The true cost of this epidemic included not only the evaluation of patients with disease but also the evaluation of those who presented because they were worried they had the disease.

The procedure is similar to that of Zahler and Cleland (J. Biol.

The reduction of oxidized glutathione by DTT at three different pH values and a partial and the complete reduction of bovine serum albumin by DTT have been characterized in order to demonstrate the use of this procedure. In the first two cases monothiol groups were readily detected without interference from DTT.

7485819,"Reduced activities of thiamine-dependent enzymes in brains of alcoholics in the absence of Wernicke's encephalopathy. The relative roles of alcohol per se, thiamine deficiency, and liver disease in the pathogenesis of alcohol-related brain damage have not been fully elucidated. In particular, the extent to which alterations of brain thiamine metabolism contribute to cognitive dysfunction in alcoholism in the absence of Wernicke's encephalopathy has not been established. In the present study, thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzymes were measured using standard spectrophotometric techniques in homogenates of brain tissue obtained at autopsy from eight alcoholic patients, all of whom died in hepatic coma without clinical or neuropathological evidence of Wernicke's encephalopathy and six nonalcoholic, age-matched controls, matched for autopsy delay time and free, at the time of death, from gross malnutrition or other neurological or psychiatric disorders. Transketolase activities were reduced in cerebellum (by 35%, p < 0.01), thalamus (by 35%, p < 0.01), frontal cortex (by 22%, p < 0.01), temporal cortex (by 20%, p < 0.01), and prefrontal cortex (by 19%, p < 0.01). Activities of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex were selectively reduced in prefrontal cortex by 25% (p < 0.01). Activities of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase were within normal limits in all brain regions of alcoholic patients. The generalized reductions of transketolase activity undoubtedly result from thiamine deficiency. Previous studies suggest that the presence of liver disease may exacerbate thiamine deficiency in alcoholics. A sustained loss of transketolase activity in brain could result in disruption of pentose shunt activity and concomitant reductions in reducing equivalents and lipid metabolism within the cell. The selective loss of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in prefrontal cortex of alcoholic cirrhotics could relate to the phenomenon of hepatic coma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology

Pathophysiology and principles for diagnosis of migraine, in particular ways to obtain an accurate history between attacks, are presented in the introduction. Identification of migraine triggers is an extremely important part of migraine therapy. Selected pain-relieving drugs should include primarily simple analgesics and antiemetics, while sumatriptan should be reserved mainly for severe migraine attacks. Pharmacotherapy, psychological and physical therapy are all components of a systemic approach to the treatment of migraine. To discontinue overused medication is the first step in the prevention of migraine. A number of available drugs are able to reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks. Several considerations should be evaluated before symptomatic and prophylactic therapies are introduced. Our strategies are based on experience collected during the treatment of 82 patients.",Immunology

7481192,"Transient effects in the Cox proportional hazards regression model. We consider a model for mortality rates that includes both the long and short term effects of switching from an initial to a second state, for example, when patients receive an initial treatment and then switch to a second treatment. We include transient effects associated with the switch in the model through the use of time-dependent covariates. One can choose the form of the time-dependent covariate to correspond with a variety of possible transition patterns. We use an exponential decay model to compare the survival experience of transplant versus dialysis treatment of end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients from the Michigan Kidney Registry (MKR). This model involves a hazard function that has an initial effect in mortality at the time of transplant, expected to be higher, followed by a smooth exponential decay to a long term effect, expected to be lower than the risk for those remaining on dialysis. Cox and Oakes used this model to analyse the Stanford Heart Transplant data. The model implicitly suggests there is a time at which the hazard curves (and survival curves) for the treatment groups cross. Those crossing times are useful in advising patients who have the option of receiving a transplant. We describe methods for obtaining estimates of the crossing times and their associated variances, and then apply them in analysing the MKR data.",Immunology

Unlike previous brachytherapy sources a number of published studies have been addressed to the dosimetry of 169 Yb seeds, manufactured in several prototypes, before widespread clinical use has been made. Discrepancies seen in the dosimetry obtained for ytterbium seed prototypes appear to be related to inconsistency and non-reproducibility in the vendor's calibration procedure to determine contained activity. Av. The comparison of 169 Yb seed dosimetries demonstrates a need for more accurate implementation of calibration procedures to determine the air kerma rate for the definitive 169 Yb seed design. This paper reports an experimental procedure to determine the reference air kerma rate, Kr (mu Gy h-1), defined as the kerma rate at 1 m along the source transverse axis in free space for the new 169 Yb seed, model X1267. A mean value of the ratio Kr/Av = 1.53 mu Gy h-1 mCi-1 was obtained from determining the Kr value of eleven seeds. Since this ratio is only 3% less than the air kerma rate constant for the 169 Yb point source, (gamma delta)k = 1.58 mu Gy h-1 m2 mCi-1, this means that the Av is closer to an apparent activity than a contained activity, Ac. A Monte Carlo simulation to determine the ratio between reference air kerma rate and the contained activity gave Kr/Ac = 1.33 mu Gy h-1 mCi-1. For the dose rate constant in water we obtained DKr (1, pi/2) = 1.20 +/- 0.05 cGy h-1 (mu Gy h-1)-1, using calibrated thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) and DKr (1, pi/2) = 1.21 +/- 0.03 cGy h-1 (mu Gy h-1)-1 by Monte Carlo simulation. TLDs were used both to determine the radial dose distribution along the seed transverse axis and to calibrate GAFChromic films to obtain the two-dimensional dose distribution around the seed.",Immunology

Acromelic acid A, which contains the kainic acid structure in its molecule, is known to cause selective damage of interneurons in the rat lower spinal cord. In the present study, the potent neurotoxicity of acromelic acid A was demonstrated in cultured rat spinal neurons in terms of the activity of lactate dehydrogenase that was released from degenerated neurons into the culture medium. Acromelic acid A increased the lactate dehydrogenase activity in time- and concentration-dependent manners, and its EC50 was about 2.5 microM, which was much lower than that of kainic acid (70 microM) and (RS)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (EC50; 11 microM). The maximum level of lactate dehydrogenase released by acromelic acid A was quite similar to that by kainic acid, but was about twice the level produced by (RS)-alpha-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid. Exposure to acromelic acid A caused release of L-glutamate from the cells into the medium; however, the concentration of L-glutamate released was far below the level for inducing the neurotoxic effects. The neurotoxicity of 10 microM acromelic acid A was almost completely inhibited by 30 microM 6-nitro-7-sulphamoylbenzo(F)quinoxaline-2,3-dione and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, potent antagonists for non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, but was partly (35%) reduced by 30 microM dizocilpine maleate. In cultured hippocampal neurons, the toxicity of acromelic acid A was significantly less effective (EC50: 18 microM) than that in spinal neurons, whereas the toxicity of kainic acid was almost the same in both neurons. These results suggest that acromelic acid A directly activates non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors on the cultured spinal neurons to induce neuronal death. A new type of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors which is specific to acromelic acid A is suggested to be present at least in spinal neurons.",Immunology

To investigate the usefulness of vamicamide, (+/-)-(2R*, 4R*)-4-dimethylamino-2-phenyl-2-(2-pyridyl)valeramide, as a novel drug for the treatment of urinary frequency and incontinence. Urinary frequency was evaluated in specially devised conscious dog and rat models by investigating the effects of the drug on urinary bladder function of these animals by cystometrography. In the dog model with transected hypogastric nerves, the bladder volume at micturition (bladder capacity) was less than 50% that of the sham-operated dog, and in the rat model with bilateral lesioning of nuclei basalis, a part of the brain, by ibotenic acid injection, bladder capacity was about 50% that of the sham-operated rat. Other bladder functions in both models were unchanged. In the dog model, orally administered vamicamide at 0.32 and 1.0 mg./kg. significantly increased bladder capacity and did not change residual urine volume or micturition pressure. Oxybutynin 0.10 mg./kg., one of the most popular drugs for the treatment of urinary frequency and incontinence, or atropine 0.10 mg./kg. induced significant increases in bladder capacity similarly to vamicamide at 0.32 mg./kg. In the rat model, oral vamicamide 0.32 mg./kg. also significantly increased bladder capacity and did not change micturition pressure or threshold pressure. Again, oxybutynin 0.10 mg./kg. or atropine 0.32 mg./kg. had almost the same effects as vamicamide 0.32 mg./kg. These findings suggest that vamicamide should be useful for the treatment of urinary frequency.",Immunology

7499410,"Transcription of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator requires a CCAAT-like element for both basal and cAMP-mediated regulation. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene in man is controlled by a tightly regulated and weak promoter. The architecture of the CFTR promoter suggests regulatory characteristics that are consistent with the absence of a TATA-like sequence, including the ability to initiate RNA transcription at numerous positions. Detailed investigation of the most proximal region of the human CFTR gene promoter through deletion and mutational analysis reveals that expression is contingent on the conservation of the inverted CCAAT sequence. Basal expression of CFTR transcription and cAMP-mediated transcriptional regulation require the presence of an imperfect and inverted CCAAT element recognized as 5'-AATTGGAAGCAAAT-3', located between 132 and 119 nucleotides upstream of the translational start site. RNA isolated from a transfected pancreatic cell line carrying integrated wild-type and mutant CFTR-directed transgenes was used to map the 5' termini of the transgenic transcripts. Analysis of the transcript termini by ribonuclease protection analysis reflects the direct association of the conserved inverted CCAAT sequence in promoting transcript initiation. Because of the requirement for the inverted CCAAT sequence for promoting transcription of CFTR, the involvement of CCAAT-binding factors is suspected in the regulation of CFTR gene transcription. To test this, we used electrophoretic mobility shift assays to demonstrate that the majority of the binding to the inverted CCAAT element, between -135 and -116, was easily competed for by binding to cognate nucleotide sequences for CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP). An antibody specific for the C/EBP-related protein, C/EBP delta, detected C/EBP delta as part of a nuclear protein complex bound to the inverted CCAAT sequence of the CFTR gene. Also, the detection of specific activating transcription factor/cyclic-AMP response element binding protein antigens by antibody supershift analysis of nuclear complexes suggest that species of this family of transcription factors could be involved in the formation of complexes with C/EBP delta within the CFTR gene inverted CCAAT-like element. These studies raise the possibility of interactions between individual members of the C/EBP and activating transcription factor/cyclic-AMP response element binding protein families potentially contribute to the tight transcriptional control rendered by the CFTR gene promoter.",Immunology

The inflammatory and crystal-induced origin of EOA is sometimes stressed in the literature, but despite the phlogistic course of the disease there is evidence against EOA being a primitive synovitis, the most cogent point being the cellular content of synovial fluid.

Physiology suitably expresses the linear relationship between hematocrit and blood fluidity, and at the same time explains how viscosity and aggregability are important co-factors in the circulation, in disease and in thromboembolic complications. The need to understand how a low hematocrit level, compared to the volemia, is a fundamental requirement in surgery, and even more so in surgery with a high risk of embolism, like orthopedic traumatology surgery. Normovolemic hemodilution was analyzed both for the risks it involves and for how much it sticks to the changes induced by a similar situation on the various organs and apparatus. The authors, based on their experience in the field of anesthesiology, propose an operating schedule to safely perform intentional normovolemic hemodilution, describing the preoperative, intraoperative and finally the postoperative period. In conclusion, the authors advocate a wider use of this technique, confirming its safety in relation to volemia.",Immunology

The kinetics of urea, creatinine and phosphate removal during dialysis were investigated in pediatric patients using a two-pool model taking into account fluid shifts and mass transfer between the two compartments. It is found that even urea must be described by a two-pool model since it presents a post dialysis rebound due to equilibration between the two compartments. Phosphate plasma concentration drops very sharply during the first hour of dialysis and rises rapidly during the rebound period. This pattern cannot be accounted for by the classical two-pool model with constant generation rate and mass transfer coefficients, but corresponds to a large time-dependent phosphate influx from the intracellular compartment in which phosphate is generated by biochemical reactions or liberated from the bones. This influx was calculated for four patients representing 8 dialysis sessions and was found to reach a plateau after 90 minutes of dialysis, dropping rapidly during the rebound period.",Immunology

The role of nitric oxide (NO) and guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in cellular regulation of endothelin-1 (ET-1) secretion was investigated in cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells. NO synthase was inhibited with NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) and guanylyl cyclase with the novel selective inhibitor, ODQ (1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one) (3 microM).

In the presence of the NO donors, spermine/NO, S-nitroso-glutathione (GSNO), and nitroprusside (NP) ET-1 secretion was reduced, but ODQ had no effect on this inhibition, although it effectively inhibited cyclic GMP production. NO release from donors, measured with a sensitive NO electrode, was greatest for spermine/NO, intermediate for GSNO, minimal for NP and paralleled inhibition of ET-1 secretion.

We characterized quantitatively the macrophage response following axonal injury in both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) of adult mammals. A monoclonal antibody (ED-1) which stains monocytes, macrophages, and activated microglia was employed. In one model, Wallerian degeneration of the sciatic nerve was studied. An increase in the number of macrophages was seen as early as 1 day following nerve transection. Macrophage number increased synchronously along the length of degenerating nerve over a 21-day period. In a second model, transection of a spinal dorsal sensory root allowed us to compare and contrast the macrophage response along the PNS and CNS portions of a single axonal pathway. An increased number of macrophages restricted to the PNS portion of this pathway was seen by 3 days and continued to increase over a 14-day period. Myelin breakdown occurred in association with an increase in the number of macrophages by 3 days in the PNS but not the CNS portion of the degenerating dorsal root axon pathway. Low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor immunohistochemical staining increased by Day 1 in the PNS but not the CNS portion of this pathway, occurring prior to the invasion of macrophages. In both models, the morphology of infiltrating macrophages changed over time from small slender ramified cells to large elongated multivacuolated cells.

The readings for 22 (63%) of the old meters (age range 1-13 yr) were within these 95% confidence limits. For the remaining 13 old meters (age range 1-13 yr) whose readings were not within these limits, there were 11 meters with readings falling below and two meters with readings above these limits.

We believe that an agent demonstrably reducing mental impairment after cardiopulmonary bypass suggests that testing such an agent in a prospective manner in people at risk for stroke would be productive, and we propose a sequence for such trials: people during and in the first month after carotid endarterectomy, then postcarotid endarterectomy patients during long-term follow-up, and finally populations at risk for spontaneous stroke in the nonvascular surgery setting.",Immunology

The effects of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) on renal handling of phosphorus, calcium, and sodium were evaluated in eight healthy men while they lived in a clinical research center for slightly more than 5 days. Subjects received a continuous intravenous infusion throughout the study of 0.45% saline and 2.5% d-glucose at 50 mL/hr (group 1, four subjects) or 150 mL/hr (group 2, four subjects). Recombinant human IGF-1 (rhIGF-1), 60 micrograms/kg body weight, was injected subcutaneously three times daily for 10 doses from day 2 until the beginning of day 5. After commencing the rhIGF-1 injections, there was a marked decrease in the fractional excretion of phosphorus in both groups that was sustained throughout the study. Urine phosphorus excretion also decreased significantly on days 2 to 5 in group 1 and on day 2 in group 2. In group 1, the fractional excretion of calcium decreased on day 2; urine calcium did not change. The fractional excretion of sodium decreased on days 2 and 4; urine sodium decreased significantly only on day 2. In group 2, the fractional and absolute urine excretion of calcium did not change. Fractional sodium excretion was not altered, and urine sodium increased only on day 5. The average serum phosphorus, calcium, and sodium did not change from baseline in groups 1 or 2. The pattern of the circadian rhythms for serum concentrations, urine excretion, and fractional excretion of phosphorus and calcium did not appear to be affected by the rhIGF-1 injections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology

Although it has been demonstrated that nonionic contrast media cause significant platelet activation in vitro, there is no reported evidence of contrast-induced platelet activation in vivo. This study investigated the effect of a nonionic contrast agent, iohexol (Omnipaque), versus an ionic contrast agent, diatrizoate meglumine+diatrizoate sodium (MD-76), on both in vitro and in vivo platelet activity. Blood from normal subjects (n = 12) was incubated in vitro for 15 to 60 seconds with varying proportions of contrast media or saline solution, and analyzed by flow cytometry for markers of platelet degranulation (P-selectin) and platelet GPIIb-IIIa receptor activation (PAC-1). In vivo activation after Omnipaque was measured in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization in peripheral blood before and after contrast (n = 5), and in coronary sinus blood before and after left coronary injections (n = 8). In vitro data showed that Omnipaque incubated for 60 seconds with whole blood at ratios of 1:1 resulted in a greater percentage of platelets expressing P-selectin (median/range) than did MD-76 (68%/38% to 90% vs 17%/1% to 53%, respectively, p < 0.01). Similarly at a contrast: blood ratio of 1:3, Omnipaque caused greater P-selectin expression than did MD-76 (49%/19% to 83% vs 3%/0% to 5%, respectively, p < 0.05). There was no significant increase in platelet degranulation observed with concentrations of contrast more dilute than 1:3. In addition, there was significantly less activation seen even at contrast:blood ratios of 1:1 when exposure time was < 60 seconds (p < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology

Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS). We studied heart rate variability in ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings from 312 patients with significant coronary artery disease and a left ventricular ejection fraction of > or = 30%. Only those patients who had both episodes of ischemia and nonsustained ventricular arrhythmias showed diminished values for parasympathetic nonspectral and spectral heart rate (HR) variability parameters. The root mean square of difference of successive R-R intervals (RMSSD) and high-frequency (HF) power in this group were 28 +/- 3 msec and 9 +/- 1 msec, respectively. The highest values of these HR variability parameters were found in patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and no ischemia (81 +/- 21 msec and 14 +/- 1 msec, respectively, p < or = 0.05).

7482009,"Crisis intervention and affective disorders: a comparative cost-effectiveness study. In recent years, psychiatric institutions have been increasingly urged to justify their clinical policies in order to ensure both effective treatment and efficient management. Assessment instruments for effectiveness and costs are essential to respond to these needs. The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of treatments for major depressive disorders. We conducted a comparative pilot investigation of treatment costs in patients with a major depressive episode assigned to specialised out-patient crisis intervention, to specialised in-patient treatment and to standard mental hospital care. The study included 122 subjects. The inclusion criteron was a diagnosis of DSM-III-R major depressive episode. Costs were assessed by determining the average cost for each treatment and the modalities of payment systems. Treatment duration and costs were high, but specialised crisis intervention may considerably reduce the duration of hospitalisation and its associated costs. The average costs of treating major depression were about 4 times greater in the specialised hospital unit than in the standard hospital unit and the crisis intervention centre. The burden of payment was comparatively higher for the state and reduced for insurance companies when the treatment of major depressive disorders involved less in-patient care.",Immunology

The incidence of tuberculosis among immigrants to the United States is 12 times that in the native-born population. Screening immigrants for tuberculosis is complicated by the widespread use of bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination. To determine the utility of tuberculin testing in adults who have been vaccinated with BCG vaccine, we studied the tuberculin reactions of 80 adults who came to us for naturalization physical examinations. No adverse effects were reported from tuberculin testing. Subjects from regions with a low prevalence of tuberculosis who had received BCG vaccine were significantly more likely to have a positive reaction than subjects who had not received BCG vaccine. However, among subjects from regions with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, there was no difference in the prevalence of positive reactions between those who reported having BCG vaccinations and those who said they had not. Interpretation of tuberculin reactions in immigrants who receive BCG vaccinations depends on the prevalence of tuberculosis in the country of origin. Adults receiving BCG vaccination who have a positive reaction and no evidence of active tuberculosis should receive prophylactic therapy or be observed carefully.",Immunology

Stigma is a feature of HIV disease and many people who are HIV-positive report that their lives are affected by fear of discrimination (felt stigma). Although opinions do not necessarily predict behaviour, this article examines whether the public's avowed attitudes to people with HIV are as punitive and stigmatizing as those infected think they are, and the extent to which public attitudes may contribute to felt stigma. A street survey was conducted in Glasgow and Edinburgh, Scotland, asking a stratified quota sample of 300 men and women of all ages to complete a short questionnaire about their attitudes toward people with HIV. The same questionnaire was also completed by 42 men and women with HIV. One in five respondents in the street survey, and all of those with HIV, were also asked to complete the questionnaire imagining that they were a typical member of the public, to find out whether both groups attributed more hostile attitudes to generalized others than they themselves professed. Overall, the general public had relatively liberal views about people with HIV although a majority felt that some restrictions should be placed upon their freedom. Controlling for age, sex, socioeconomic status and city, people with HIV had more liberal attitudes than the general public, but perceived public attitudes to be far less liberal than were reported in the street survey. Respondents in the street survey also perceived generalized others to be less liberal than themselves. These results provide evidence of felt stigma among people with HIV and the policy implications are discussed. The findings are also set within a theoretical framework concerning the nature of attitudes, their relationship to behaviours, and the pervasiveness of negative images associated with AIDS.",Immunology

The distribution of 5-fluorouracil through cervical tissue has been assessed following the in vitro application of a bioadhesive patch to excised human cervix. The bioadhesive matrix contained a total of 20 mg of 5-fluorouracil spiked with 5-fluorouracil-6-3H and was applied for fixed periods of either 4 or 24 hours. Tissue slices were sectioned perpendicular to the plane of the applied patch and the autoradiographic image developed by placing a frozen tissue slice on Hyperfilm with subsequent instant thawing and refreezing, the resulting bilayer being maintained at -18 degrees C for 24 hours. The developed image was analysed by scanning densitometry and raster scans were visualised with three-dimensional contouring software. The autoradiograms showed darker areas surrounding tissue ducts, suggesting that 5-FU was spilling from the lumen into the surrounding stroma. Transport of 5FU via aqueous channels may thus make an important contribution to the rapid penetration of the drug through the cervical stroma. Three-dimensional autoradiographic images showed that, for a 4-hour patch application, there were areas of relatively low drug concentration within the upper 5 mm of tissue, where CIN lesions can exist in the glandular tissue or cervical crypts. However, extending the application time to 24 hours produced areas of high drug concentration extending throughout this region.",Immunology

The recent development of mice Vav -/- has confirmed a major role of Vav in early blood cell development. We previously showed that Vav constitutively interacts with glutathione-S-transferase-Grb2. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments supported the idea of a complex formed by Vav-Grb2 in vivo. This complex is of potential interest in signaling of hematopoietic cells. In this work we localize the domains of Vav and Grb2 involved in this interaction. By the use of an in vivo genetic approach (the double hybrid system) and through in vitro experiments (glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins) we furnish evidence that the interaction between Vav and Grb2 involves the C-SH3 domain of Grb2 and the proline-rich region located in the N-SH3 of Vav. Furthermore this was confirmed by the use of both Vav and Sos derived proline-rich peptides which blocked the binding. In addition we show that Vav also interacts with Grb3-3, a naturally occurring Grb2 isoform wich lacks functional SH2 domain.",Immunology

Intrinsic membrane properties and synaptic responses of neocortical neurons located lateral to photochemically induced ischemic lesions were investigated using neocortical slice preparation. In comparison to neurons from control slices, these neurons had a significantly less negative resting membrane potential without any significant change in input resistance. In addition, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediated synaptic inhibition was found to be less efficient; the conductances of both the early and late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) were significantly smaller, and the reversal potential of the early IPSP was shifted to a more positive value. In some of the neurons, 'epileptiform' postsynaptic potentials could be elicited, which were abolished after wash-in of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP-5).

We present the molecular characterization of the asmA gene, whose product is involved in the assembly of outer membrane proteins in Escherichia coli K-12. The asmA locus was initially identified as a site for suppressor mutations of an assembly defective OmpF315. Our data suggest that these suppressor mutations either completely abolish or reduce asmA expression and can be complemented in trans by plasmid clones carrying asmA sequences. The recessive nature of asmA suppressor mutations suggests that the functional AsmA protein participates in inhibiting the assembly of OmpF315 and other mutant OmpFs. As the assembly of wild-type and parental OmpF proteins was not affected by asmA mutations, AsmA must provide an environment refractory only to the assembly of mutant OmpF proteins. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that AsmA plays a minor role in the assembly of wild-type and parental OmpF in wild-type cells. The presence of a putative signal sequence within the amino-terminal sequence of AsmA suggests that it is either a periplasmic or an outer membrane protein. This predicted location of AsmA is compatible with its role in the assembly of outer membrane proteins.",Immunology

Children with mild-severe sensorineural hearing losses often use hearing aids and aural/oral language as their primary mode of communication, yet we know little about how speech is processed by these children. The purpose of this research was to investigate how the multidimensional information underlying accurate speech perception is processed by children with mild-severe hearing impairments. The processing of the auditory and linguistic dimensions of speech was assessed with a speeded selective-attention task (Garner, 1974a). Listeners were required to attend selectively to an auditory dimension (gender of the talker) and ignore a linguistic dimension (word) and vice versa. The hypothesis underlying the task is that performance for the target dimension will be unaffected by what is happening on the nontarget dimension if the dimensions are processed independently. On the other hand, if the dimensions are not processed independently, listeners will not be able to attend selectively and performance for the relevant dimension will be affected by what is happening on the irrelevant dimension (termed ""Garner"" interference). Both children with normal hearing (N = 90) and children with hearing impairment (N = 40) showed some degree of Garner interference, implying that the dimensions of speech are not processed independently by these children. However, relative to the children with normal hearing, the children with hearing impairment showed normal Garner interference when attending selectively to the word dimension (normally effective at ignoring talker-gender input) and reduced Garner interference when attending selectively to the talker-gender dimension (more effective at ignoring word input). This pattern of results implies that the auditory dimension has a normal strength-of-processing level that makes it normally distracting and that the linguistic dimension has an underdeveloped strength-of-processing level that makes it easier to ignore in children with hearing impairment.",Immunology

Of these 45 patients, 14 patients received lymphadenectomy and 31 patients received adrenalectomy. For comparative analysis, 4 patients with laparoscopic cholecystectomies were also examined. Under general anesthesia, carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) was analyzed before, during, and after the pneumoperitoneum. The data were analysed along with 4 factors; the patient's spirographic parameters, alveolar-arterial gas difference (AaDO2), insufflation pressure for the pneumoperitoneum, and operating time. After starting the pneumoperitoneum, PaCO2 levels rose significantly. The PaCO2 levels of patients underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy were higher than that of patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The preoperative vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1.0) did not show a significant difference of increase in the degree of PaCO2 increase. In contrast, the important factors that were closely related to the elevation of PaCO2 were preoperative AaDO2 and intraoperative insufflation pressure. Patients with high preoperative AaDO2 (> 10 torr) showed a significant increase in PaCO2 levels after pneumoperitoneum. When insufflation pressure was high (> = 10 mmHg), there was a significant rise of PaCO2 after pneumoperitoneum. In all patients whose operating time was 300 minutes or more, high levels of PaCO2 continued on the next day after surgery.

Unfortunately, the extensive use of these agents has resulted in disabling and life-threatening adverse effects in many patients. The advent of concomitant corticosteroid/cyclosporin regimens has allowed a reduction in the dosages of steroids administered, yet steroid-induced morbidity is still a major problem in many cyclosporin-treated renal transplant patients. After favourable initial experiences with cyclosporin monotherapy, several attempts at steroid-free immunosuppression in renal transplant patients have been undertaken, either by not starting steroids after transplantation or by stopping steroids in patients with stable graft function. Most controlled and uncontrolled trials showed that with either strategy short term graft survival was similar with or without steroids, but acute rejection was more frequent in patients not taking steroids. The percentage of patients who could be maintained steroid-free ranged from 28 to 94%, and was higher in patients who stopped steroids later than in those never receiving them. Little information is available about long term follow-up of these patients. Some studies reported late attrition of renal function in patients not taking steroids, while others reported a favourable outcome even in the long term. Steroid-free immunosuppression is feasible in renal transplant patients, but it requires careful monitoring of renal function and cyclosporin dosage. This strategy is particularly indicated in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease or steroid-related complications, and in children. Nevertheless, several issues need to be better elucidated by further studies, namely the long term outcome of steroid-free immunosuppression, the advantages and disadvantages of steroid avoidance versus steroid withdrawal, and the criteria for selecting patients.",Immunology

Previous studies suggested that varicella-zoster virus derives its final envelope from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and that envelope glycoproteins (gps) are transported to the TGN independently of nucleocapsids. We tested the hypothesis that gpI is targeted to the TGN as a result of a signal sequence or patch encoded in its cytosolic domain. cDNAs encoding gpI wild type (wt) and a truncated mutant gpI(trc) lacking transmembrane and cytosolic domains were cloned by using the PCR. Cells transfected with cDNA encoding gpI(wt) or gpI(trc) synthesized and N glycosylated the proteins. gpI(wt) accumulated in the TGN, some reached the plasmalemma, but none was secreted. In contrast, gpI(trc) was retained and probably degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum; none was found on cell surfaces, but some was secreted. The distribution of gpI(trc) was not affected by deletion of potential glycosylation sites. To locate a potential gpI-targeting sequence, cells were transfected with cDNA encoding chimeric proteins in which the ectodomain of a plasmalemmal marker, the interleukin-2 receptor (tac), was fused to different domains of gpI. A chimeric protein in which tac was fused with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of gpI was targeted to the TGN. In contrast, a chimeric protein in which tac was fused only with the gpI transmembrane domain passed through the TGN and concentrated in endosomes. We conclude that gpI is targeted to the TGN as a result of a targeting sequence or patch in its cytosolic domain.",Immunology
7494278,"A rabbitpox virus serpin gene controls host range by inhibiting apoptosis in restrictive cells. Poxviruses are unique among viruses in encoding members of the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. Orthopoxviruses contain three serpins, designated SPI-1, SPI-2, and SPI-3. SPI-1 encodes a 40-kDa protein that is required for the replication of rabbitpox virus (RPV) in PK-15 or A549 cells in culture (A. N. Ali, P. C. Turner, M. A. Brooks, and R. W. Moyer, Virology 202:305-314, 1994). Examination of nonpermissive human A549 cells infected with an RPV mutant disrupted in the SPI-1 gene (RPV delta SPI-1) suggests there are no gross defects in protein or DNA synthesis. The proteolytic processing of late viral structural proteins, a feature of orthopoxvirus infections associated with the maturation of virus particles, also appears relatively normal. However, very few mature virus particles of any kind are produced compared with the level found in infections with wild-type RPV. Morphological examination of RPV delta SPI-1-infected A549 cells, together with an observed fragmentation of cellular DNA, suggests that the host range defect is associated with the onset of apoptosis. Apoptosis is seen only in RPV delta SPI-1 infection of nonpermissive (A549 or PK-15) cells and is absent in all wild-type RPV infections and RPV delta SPI-2 mutant infections examined to date. Although the SPI-1 gene is expressed early, before DNA replication, the triggering apoptotic event occurs late in the infection, as RPV delta SPI-1-infected A549 cells do not undergo apoptosis when infections are carried out in the presence of cytosine arabinoside. While the SPI-2 (crmA) gene, when transfected into cells, has been shown to inhibit apoptosis, our experiments provide the first indication that a poxvirus serpin protein can inhibit apoptosis during a poxvirus infection.",Immunology

Examination of the interaction between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) regulatory gene products and the host immune system is fundamental to understanding the pathogenesis of HIV and could reveal possible targets for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of AIDS. The HIV Tat gene is a potential candidate for this type of strategy. Transgenic mice can be used to investigate the in vivo effects of Tat on the developing and dynamic immune system and on cellular gene expression. Thus, we have generated transgenic mice that harbor the HIV type 1 Tat gene under the transcriptional control of the human CD2 gene regulatory elements. This expression cassette results in high-level, tissue-specific transcription of the transgene within the T-cell compartment. In this report, we demonstrate the effects of Tat on the in vivo immune system. CD2-Tat transgenic mice show no signs of aberrant thymic development and have normal levels of T-cell subsets in the thymus and peripheral lymphoid organs. However, activated T cells from transgenic mice contain increased levels of tumor necrosis factor beta mRNA as well as biologically active tumor necrosis factor protein and express elevated levels of transforming growth factor beta and interleukin-4 receptor mRNA. These increased cytokine levels do not appear to alter mitogen- or antigen-stimulated responses or induce the formation of dermal lesions in ageing mice. Such investigations should provide insight into the combination of host immune factors mediating pathogenesis in HIV infection.",Immunology
7494247,"Discriminated selection among viral peptides with the appropriate anchor residues: implications for the size of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte repertoire and control of viral infection. Structural characterization of peptides restricted by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules has identified residues critical for MHC class I binding and for T-cell receptor recognition. For example, optimal peptides fitting into the murine MHC class I Db groove are 9 to 11 amino acids long and require as MHC anchor residues an Asn (N) at position 5 and also either a hydrophobic residue, a Met (M) or a Cys (C), at the carboxy terminus. The three known Db-restricted peptides of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) are glycoproteins GP1 (amino acids [aa] 33 KAVYNFATC), GP2 (aa 276 SGVENPGGYCL), and nucleoprotein NP (aa 396 FQPQNGQFI). In addition to these two GP and one NP peptides, computer search revealed 11 other GP peptide sequences and 20 additional NP sequences that contained the Db binding motif. By Db competitive binding analysis, only two of these 11 GP peptides and 1 of these 20 NP peptides bound to the MHC Db molecule with an affinity equivalent to the measured affinities for the three known GP1, GP2, and NP cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes. No CTL specific for these three peptides were generated when H-2b mice were inoculated with viral variants in which either the two known GP epitopes (GP1 and GP2; termed GPV) or the GPV and NP epitopes (termed GPV + NPV) were mutated. However, a novel CD8+ anti-LCMV CTL response ordinarily not seen in H-2b mice inoculated with wild-type virus was noted when such mice were inoculated with the GPV + NPV-mutated variant. This result indicates that (i) despite large numbers of peptides containing the appropriate anchor residues within a viral protein, only a restricted number induce CTL, thereby maintaining a limited CTL repertoire, (ii) despite the limited repertoire, the immune system retains the flexibility to generate an immune response(s) to a previously silent protein(s), suggesting a hierarchial control mechanism, and (iii) identification of a primary amino acid sequence is not sufficient, per se, to predict CTL epitopes, and peptide conformations are likely more complex than indicated by simple linear sequence comparisons.",Immunology

To help clarify the physiological function of this protein, particularly in humans, a full-length human liver cDNA clone was isolated, sequenced, and expressed in milligram quantities with the use of a baculovirus expression system. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature protein contained two thioredoxin-like active site motifs (CGHC) and in its C-terminus a nuclear localization motif (KPKKKKK), and an ER-retention/retrieval motif (QEDL). The mature form of human P58 shared 95% amino acid sequence identity with the deduced amino acid sequences of a bovine liver cDNA, 93% with a murine B lymphocyte cDNA, and 91% with a rat basophilic leukemia cell cDNA. In contrast to reports on the activities of nonhuman forms of P58, the purified expressed human P58 showed no carnitine acyltransferase or protease activities.

Although the interaction of proteins with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as heparin are of great importance, the general structural requirements for protein- or peptide-GAG interaction have not been well characterized. Electrostatic interactions between sulfate and carboxylate groups on the GAG and basic residues in the protein or peptide dominate the interaction, but the thermodynamics of these electrostatic interactions have not been studied. Arginine residues occur frequently in the known heparin binding sites of proteins. Arginine is also more common than lysine in randomly synthesized 7-mer peptides that bind to immobilized heparin and heparan sulfate. We have used heparin affinity chromatography, equilibrium dialysis, and isothermal titration calorimetry techniques to further investigate these interactions. A 7-mer of arginine eluted from a heparin-affinity column at 0.82 M NaCl, whereas the analogous 7-mer of lysine eluted at 0.64 M. Similarly, the putative heparin binding site peptide (amino acid residues 110-130) from acidic fibroblast growth factor, which contained four lysine and two arginine residues, eluted at 0.50 M, whereas the analogous peptide with six lysine residues eluted at 0.41 M and one with six arginine residues eluted at 0.54 M. At 25 degrees C in 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, carboxy and amino termini blocked arginine (blocked arginine) bound to heparin twice as tightly as blocked lysine as measured by equilibrium dialysis Similarly, at 30 degrees C in 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and in water, blocked arginine bound 2.5 times more tightly to anions in heparin than blocked lysine. Using titration calorimetry, the enthalpy of blocked arginine and lysine binding to heparin was 1.14 +/- 0.24 and 0.45 +/- 0.35 kJ/mol, respectively, under identical conditions. Our observations show that blocked arginine- and arginine-containing peptides bound more tightly to GAGs than the analogous lysine species and suggest that the difference was due to the intrinsic properties of the arginine and lysine side chains. The greater affinity of the guanidino cation for sulfate in GAGs is probably due to stronger hydrogen bonding and a more exothermic electrostatic interaction. This can be rationalized by soft acid, soft base concepts.",Immunology

The recovery characteristics of desflurane and sevoflurane were compared when used for maintenance of ambulatory anesthesia. After obtaining informed consent, 42 healthy, unpremedicated women undergoing laparoscopic sterilization procedures were studied. Anesthesia was induced with propofol, 1.5-2.0 mg/kg, and maintained with either desflurane 3%-6% (n = 21) or sevoflurane 1%-2% (n = 21) with 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Intraoperative analgesia and neuromuscular block was achieved using fentanyl and vecuronium, respectively. The inhaled anesthetics were titrated to achieve an adequate clinical ""depth of anesthesia"" and to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) within 20% of the preinduction baseline values. Visual analog scales (VAS) and the digit-symbol substitution test (DSST) were performed preoperatively and at 30-min intervals during the recovery period. There were no differences between the two groups in the total doses of propofol, fentanyl, or vecuronium. Heart rate (HR) values were lower in the sevoflurane group during the induction-to-incision period. However, HR and MAP were otherwise similar during the maintenance and recovery periods. Use of desflurane led to a more rapid emergence (4.8 +/- 2.4 vs 7.8 +/- 3.8 min) and shorter time to extubation (5.1 +/- 2.2 vs 8.2 +/- 4.2 min) compared to sevoflurane (mean values +/- SD). Intermediate recovery times, postoperative VAS and DSST scores, and side effects were similar in the two treatment groups. Although sevoflurane was associated with a slower emergence from anesthesia than desflurane after laparoscopic surgery, recovery of cognitive function and discharge times were similar in the two anesthetic groups. Thus, it would appear that sevoflurane is an acceptable alternative to desflurane for maintenance of outpatient anesthesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunology

7485468,"Calcium requirement for cGMP production during muscarinic activation of N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells. Muscarinic agonists elicit large increases in intracellular Ca2+ and guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells. Both signals are blocked in cells loaded with the Ca2+ buffer 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid showing that the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) is necessary to stimulate cGMP accumulation. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) blocks the cGMP response without affecting the peak amplitude of the intracellular Ca2+ signal, and it is concluded that Ca(2+)-dependent activation of NOS is required for cGMP production. cGMP accumulation is reduced by 60% when cells are bathed in Ca(2+)-free saline, but the peak change in [Ca2+]i is not affected. This suggests that Ca2+ influx is strongly coupled to the activation of cGMP production, even though it makes a smaller contribution to the intracellular Ca2+ signal than does Ca2+ release. Thapsigargin, which releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores, activates Ca2+ influx and increases cGMP. The cGMP increase is transient and follows approximately the same time course as Ca2+ store depletion. Ca2+ influx remains activated after store depletion, however, which indicates that influx alone cannot sustain cGMP production. It is concluded that summation of Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ release is necessary to reach a threshold Ca2+ level needed to stimulate cGMP accumulation. Because of the large contribution from Ca2+ influx, we suggest that NOS or a cofactor necessary for its activation may be located close to Ca2+ channels in the membrane.",Immunology
7485342,"Inhibition of neutrophil oxidative burst and phagocytosis by meconium. Meconium in amniotic fluid has been associated with an increased prevalence of chorioamnionitis. In an effort to delineate the mechanism of this association, we determined the effect of meconium on the neutrophil's capacity for phagocytosis and microbial killing by oxidative burst in vitro. Sterile meconium samples were obtained from four fetuses at the time of breech delivery and were then pooled and lyophilized. Neutrophils were purified from whole blood of each of 13 pregnant nonlaboring patients. Phagocytosis and the oxidative burst of neutrophils in the presence and absence of meconium were assessed by single-cell analysis with flow cytometry. Phagocytosis was measured as the mean fluorescence intensity produced after 30 minutes of incubation with fluorescein-labeled Escherichia coli. Oxidative burst was measured as the mean fluorescence intensity resulting from the oxidation of internalized reduced dichlorodihydrofluorescein after 15 minutes of stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate. Oxidative burst was expressed as the neutrophil oxidative index and the net fluorescence intensity. Neutrophil oxidative index was equivalent to the quotient of the mean fluorescence intensity for phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated and unstimulated cells. Net fluorescence intensity was equivalent to the absolute difference between stimulated and unstimulated cells. Exposure of neutrophils to light and very light meconium each resulted in significantly lower mean neutrophil oxidative index compared with unexposed controls (3.2 +/- 4.9 and 4.2 +/- 5.9 vs 16.2 +/- 7.5, p = 0.00002 and p = 0.0007, respectively) and significantly lower mean net fluorescence intensity than that of control cells (112 +/- 220 and 188 +/- 294 vs 613 +/- 328, p = 0.0001 and p = 0.005, respectively). Phagocytosis was significantly impaired in the presence of moderate meconium compared with control cells (2239 +/- 393 vs 4645 +/- 2071, p = 0.0001). Light meconium did not significantly affect phagocytosis. Meconium has significant effects on neutrophil function in vitro. Both light and very light meconium inhibit the oxidative burst.

A total of 1,000 lymphocyte interphase nuclei per proband from 90 females and 138 males age 1 wk to 93 years were analyzed by in situ hybridization for loss of the X and Y chromosomes, respectively. Both sex chromosomes showed an age-dependent loss. In males, Y hypoploidy was very low up to age 15 years (0.05%) but continuously increased to a frequency of 1.34% in men age 76-80 years. In females, the baseline level for X chromosome loss is much higher than that seen for the Y chromosome in males. Even prepubertal females show a rate of X chromosome loss, on the order of 1.5%-2.5%, rising to approximately 4.5%-5% in women older than 75 years. Dividing the female probands into three biological age groups on the basis of sex hormone function (< 13 years, 13-51 years, and > 51 years), a significant correlation of X chromosome loss versus age could clearly be demonstrated in women beyond age 51 years. Females age 51-91 years showed monosomy X at a rate from 3.2% to 5.1%. In contrast to sex chromosomal loss, the frequency of autosomal monosomies does not change during the course of aging: Chromosome 1 and chromosome 17 monosomic cells were found with a constant incidence of 1.2% and 1%, respectively.

To determine the outcomes of patients admitted to a non-intensive care telemetry unit and to assess the role of telemetry for guiding patient management decisions, data from 2,240 patients admitted to a telemetry unit were collected prospectively during 7 months. Physicians recorded the outcomes (intensive care unit transfer and mortality) and assessed whether telemetry assisted in guiding patient management. Indications for admission to the telemetry unit included chest pain syndromes (55%), arrhythmias (14%), heart failure (12%), and syncope (10%). Telemetry led to direct modifications in management in 156 patients (7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.9% to 8%). Telemetry was perceived as useful but did not alter management for 127 patients (5.7%; 95% CI 4.7% to 6.6%). Two hundred forty-one patients were transferred to an intensive care unit from the telemetry unit (10.8%; 95% CI 9.5% to 12%). Nineteen patients (0.8% of all admissions; 95% CI 0.5% to 1.2%) were transferred because of an arrhythmia identified by telemetry. Routine transfer after cardiac revascularization or surgery accounted for 134 transfers; clinical deterioration accounted for 88 transfers. There were 20 deaths in the unit (0.9%; 95% CI 0.5% to 1.3%): 4 of the 20 deaths occurred while patients were being monitored. The role of telemetry in guiding patient management may be overestimated by physicians, since it detected significant arrhythmias that led to change in medications or urgent interventions in a small fraction of patients.",Immunology

To determine whether the other major PA, urokinase (u-PA), which also complexes with PAI-1, is metabolised via the same mechanism, 125I-labelled high (hmw) and low (lmw) molecular weight forms of u-PA were incubated with Hep G2 cells at 4 degrees C for 2 hr in the absence and presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabelled ligand in order to detect specific binding. Both hmw and lmw 125I-u-PA formed complexes with PAI-1 and these bound specifically and with high affinity (apparent Kd 3.9 and 4.1 nM, with Bmax 78 x 10(3) and 83 x 10(3) binding sites/cell respectively). Binding by each form of radiolabelled u-PA was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by unlabelled t-PA, hmw-u-PA, lmw-u-PA, and by monoclonal anti-PAI-1 antibody. At 37 degrees C, bound hmw and lmw 125I-u-PA.PAI-1 complexes were internalised and degraded rapidly. These findings indicate that the specificity of the previously described receptor which mediates PAI-1 dependent catabolism of t-PA by Hep G2 cells extends to complexes of u-PA with this inhibitor.",Immunology

In the presence of the re-uptake inhibitor nomifensine, which increased DA levels to 350% of basal values, systemic administration of the non-selective D1/D2 antagonist haloperiol induced an immediate increase in DA and DOPAC levels to 145% of pretreatment values.

Upon basal extracellular DA levels (without nomifensine), local infusion of the D2 agonist (-)N-0437 equally did not affect the DA or DOPAC levels in the MBH. Furthermore, the increase in DA levels induced by haloperidol could not be antagonized by the D1 agonist CY 208-243.

In recent years, methods have been developed to evaluate effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and quality of oral health services and delivery mechanisms. These evaluation techniques are important to the application of oral health services, because most oral health services have not been adequately evaluated. For many services, evaluation may not be necessary. However, there is wide variation in clinical practices and accumulating evidence that many health practices, although based on reasonable pathophysiologic grounds, are not resulting in their expected health benefits. This has led to the suggestion that all clinical precepts may be questioned. A number of measures are used by researchers to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of oral health services. These include: Effectiveness and appropriateness: Methods available to assess health practices range from clinical observation to strictly controlled randomized clinical trials. Cost-effectiveness: Benefit-cost and cost effectiveness analyses. Quality: No tool exists that will single-handedly measure quality. Current methodologies should be based on the following three-dimensional conceptual framework: Structure (evaluation of facilities, equipment, personnel, and organization to deliver care), process (observance of the patient-provider interaction), and outcome (measures of health status and patient outcomes).

It is known that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) plays an important role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease in the general population. Although upper gastrointestinal mucosal lesions have been one of the most common complications in patients with chronic renal failure, quite few reports are available regarding the prevalence of H. pylori and its influence on the upper gastro-intestinal tract. The present study was conducted to examine whether H. pylori is involved in the pathogenesis of upper gastrointestinal mucosal lesions in dialysis patients. The subjects consisted of 43 dialysis patients with upper gastro-intestinal tract symptoms. Thirty-four patients without any known kidney disease were used as controls. Gastric mucosa and gastric juice were obtained endoscopically. For the determination of H. pylori, culture of biopsy specimens from the gastric mucosa and histopathological examination with hematoxylin-eosin stain were used. Concentrations of serum gastrin and gastric juice ammonia were also measured. H. pylori was observed in 53.5% of the dialysis group and 64.0% of the controls. Gastro-duodenal lesions in H. pylori-positive dialysis patients included atrophic gastritis, superficial gastritis, erosive gastritis, and gastric ulcer. In the dialysis group, ammonia concentrations in the gastric juice were higher in patients with H. pylori than in those without H. pylori (489.1 +/- 35.8 mu g/ml vs 67.0 +/- 19.2 mu g/ml, p < 0.001).

Our results showed that the increase in DNA synthesis produced by the addition of IGF-1 to cells cultured with saturable concentrations of IL-2, correlated well with an increase in the number of cells expressing IL-2-alpha chain receptor. The effect on both DNA synthesis and IL-2-alpha chain receptor expression was greater at lower concentrations of PHA.

We used the powerful technique of randomization-selection to probe the overall structure of the intron and to investigate its role in pre-mRNA splicing. We identified a number of alternative RNA-RNA interactions in the intron that promote efficient splicing, and we showed that similar base pairings can also improve splicing efficiency in artificially designed introns. Only a very limited amount of structural information is necessary to create or maintain such a mechanism. Our results suggest that the base pairing contributes transiently to the spliceosome assembly process, most likely by complementing interactions between splicing factors.

The recent elucidation of the molecular structure of the several of these translocations has revealed some striking similarities. Nearly all appear to result in the production of novel, tumor-specific chimeric transcription factors. Furthermore, six of the translocations, namely the t(11;22), t(21;22), and t(7;22) of Ewing's sarcoma, the t(12;22) of clear cell sarcoma, the t(12;16) of myxoid liposarcoma, and the t(11;22) of desmoplastic small round cell tumor, achieve this following a peculiar pattern, consisting in the fusion of a gene with an RNA-binding domain (EWS or TLS) with a transcription factor gene (FLI1, ERG, ETV1, ATF-1, CHOP, or WT1). The observation that the different translocation partners of the EWS gene are specifically associated with several distinct types of primitive sarcomas suggests a model in which the translocation partner supplying the DNA-binding domain confers the target specificity of the transcriptional activation mediated by these chimeric proteins, whereas the partner supplying the N-terminal domain and promoter region determines their transactivation potential and expression level. Further analysis of the normal functions and expression patterns of these genes should yield insights into the histogenesis of these different tumor types and into normal tissue development and differentiation.

The presence of a t(12;21) was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We report that fusion of TEL to AML1 is specifically observed in at least 16% of the childhood B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) investigated, none of which had been previously identified as harboring t(12;21).",Immunology
7492686,"Molecular characterization of a hamster oviduct-specific glycoprotein. There is growing evidence that the oviduct is not a passive conduit for gamete and embryo transport but serves a function for the gametes and/or embryos. The oviductal epithelium secretes one or more specific glycoproteins that associate with the egg after ovulation. Several published reports including our preliminary studies have suggested that the egg-associating glycoprotein(s) from the oviduct exists in several mammalian species including golden hamster. However, little or almost no biochemical characterization of the hamster oviduct-specific glycoprotein (HOGP) has been reported. To analyze the molecular structure of the HOGP in detail, we have attempted molecular cloning of cDNA corresponding to HOGP. A cDNA library constructed from the hamster oviduct in the phage vector lambda ZAPII was screened with digoxigenin-labeled, baboon oviduct-specific glycoprotein cDNA as the probe. A single positive clone was isolated, and the nucleotide sequence of the isolated cDNA was determined. Rapid amplification of cDNA end was carried out to obtain a proximal 5' cDNA end of the clone. The cDNA clone consisted of 2387 bp, and the coding region contained 2013 bp translating to 671 amino acids. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence confirmed the chemically determined NH2-terminal sequence of a HOGP and suggested that the derived amino acid sequence contained a signal peptide region (21 amino acids) and 650 amino acids (70,890 daltons) of the mature form of the HOGP region. The amino acid sequence of HOGP appeared to have eight potential N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis revealed that a single message of approximately 2.5 kb was present in oviductal RNA but not in the RNA of several other hamster tissues. The HOGP showed high amino acid sequence homology with baboon, bovine, and human oviduct-specific glycoprotein. These results demonstrate that an oviduct-specific glycoprotein homologue gene exists in various mammalian species including rodent.",Immunology
7492258,"Frontal and temporal lobe brain volumes in schizophrenia. Relationship to symptoms and clinical subtype. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies demonstrate reduced brain volumes in schizophrenics, but specific structural abnormalities have not been clearly delineated. The structural abnormalities of this disorder are likely to be heterogeneous, consistent with its diverse clinical presentation. To investigate the relationship between structural abnormality and clinical symptoms, we examined regional brain and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) volumes in a large sample of schizophrenic patients and controls, with patients aggregated into clinical subtypes. Right and left hemisphere frontal and temporal lobe brain and CSF volumes were quantified from 5-mm axial spin-echo MRIs for 71 schizophrenic patients and 77 age- and sex-matched controls. The following four standardized rating scales were used to assess symptom severity: Negative Symptoms, Disorganization, Schneiderian Delusions and Hallucinations, and Suspicion-Hostility. Patients were also subtyped as either deficit or nondeficit on the basis of enduring negative symptoms. Schizophrenic patients overall exhibited abnormal brain asymmetry, with selective decrease in brain volume in the left temporal and right frontal regions. Left temporal lobe parenchymal volume reduction and CSF volume increase were correlated with the severity of negative symptoms. Consistent with this, the subtype analysis revealed abnormal temporal lobe asymmetry for the deficit subgroup only. Right frontal lobe volume reduction correlated with the duration of illness, independent of symptom severity or schizophrenic subtype. Abnormal lateral asymmetry suggests selective structural deficits in schizophrenia, rather than diffusely undifferentiated CNS abnormalities. The pattern of regional abnormalities is related to clinical symptoms, with negative symptoms being associated with left temporal lobe rather than frontal lobe abnormality. This is consistent with suggestions of a temporolimbic prefrontal network abnormality in schizophrenia. Further longitudinal studies are warranted, using higher-resolution MRI technology and gray matter-white matter segmentation to confirm and extend these findings.",Immunology

Radiofrequency ablation of the AV conduction tissue (His-bundle ablation) is an accepted treatment for therapy resistant atrial fibrillation/flutter. However, data on the long-term effects of the procedure are limited. We followed 50 patients for a mean of 17 months after AV junction ablation. The indication was treatment resistant atrial fibrillation or flutter. The patients underwent a standardized interview performed by two nurses. Health care was studied via the in-patient register. Subjective improvement was reported by 88% and the number of days in hospital per year was reduced from 17 to 7. The use of antiarrhythmic drugs was reduced by 75%. If the reduction in costs of drugs and days in hospital is compared with the cost of the ablation and the pacemaker implantation, breaking even is achieved after 2.6 years. We could not confirm that patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation note less improvement than those with chronic fibrillation. Ablation of the AV junction is a cost effective treatment with good long-term results and relatively few complications. Chronic atrial fibrillation: If sinus rhythm cannot be established and in cases in which heart rate regulating drugs have been ineffective, ablation of the AV junction with implantation of a VVIR pacemaker is recommended. If the patient despite treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs continues to have symptomatic episodes of atrial fibrillation, then AV junction ablation with implantation of a permanent pacemaker is recommended. Patients who have self-limiting episodes of atrial fibrillation should be given a DDDR pacemaker with an automatic mode switch. Patients who do not have self-limiting attacks and require DC conversion, should receive a VVIR pacemaker.",Immunology
7491303,"Atrial pacing leads: the clinical contribution of steroid elution. Although the original atrial pacing leads were passive fixation and J shaped for right atrial appendage placement, the subsequent development of the active fixation screw-in lead found favor because of a perceived low incidence of lead dislodgment and a wider selection of atrial pacing sites. A bipolar atrial lead study was undertaken to compare the long-term atrial implant data in 215 patients. Study leads comprised one passive fixation, steroid-eluting lead (Medtronic CapSure SP, 119 patients) and three nonsteroid-eluting leads; two active fixation (Medtronic BISPING model 4058, 30 patients; and Telectronics ACCUFIX model 330-801, 44 patients) and one passive fixation (Telectronics ENCOR model 330-854, 22 patients). Bipolar atrial voltage stimulation thresholds and electrograms were measured using the Telectronics META DDDR immediately postimplantation, and at 1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-up. There were 135 males and the mean age 68 years. The incidence of lead dislodgment was 4% for active fixation and 2% for passive fixation. All nonsteroid leads showed a typical rise in stimulation threshold with the highest being the ACCUFIX followed by the BISPING and ENCOR. The steroid-eluting CapSure SP, however, demonstrated a flat response with 98% of leads at 18 months having a value < or = 1.3 volts allowing voltage programming to 2.5 volts (2:1 safety ratio). Telemeted electrograms showed no differences for all leads at all visits. For low voltage atrial pacing with a low incidence of dislodgment and satisfactory atrial sensing, the steroid-eluting passive fixation lead is superior to all nonsteroid-eluting leads.",Immunology

7490692,"Cholesterol and psychological well-being. The debate about possible adverse effects associated with low or lowered serum cholesterol has raised important scientific questions concerning the links between lipids and behaviour. One of the most unexpected findings has been an association between cholesterol-lowering treatment and accidental death. A similar association has also emerged among the prospective cohort studies, with higher-than-expected numbers of suicide deaths in the lowest cholesterol groups. These observations have prompted speculation that behavioural or emotional disturbances could be part of the process linking lipids and accidental death. In this paper, the epidemiological literature is reviewed briefly, then the evidence for depression as a mediating condition is discussed. Two conclusions are drawn from this review of the literature. One is that understanding the relationship between the biology of lipids and the psychobiology of mood is demonstrably an important scientific and public health issue. The second is that the introduction of new treatments or preventive programmes should include a careful evaluation of the psychological as well as the physical effects.",Immunology

The overall detection rate of ipsilateral stenoses > 70% and occlusions was 13.5%; the detection rate of surgically significant carotid lesions (70-99%) was only 8%. Analysis by diagnostic category revealed a significantly greater detection rate for carotid lesions > 70% in patients presenting with amaurosis fugax (24%) in comparison to those with TIAs (9.5%, p = 0.0005) or following a stroke (13%, p = 0.01). Patients referred with asymptomatic bruits or prior to cardiac surgery showed a positive scan rate of 30%. Sixty-seven carotid endarterectomies have resulted from scans performed in this period. The overall rate of detection for surgically relevant lesions is low, but in comparison to a similar audit conducted in 1992, the absolute number of carotid lesions > 70% has risen by 60%.

7488762,"Circadian rhythm of body temperature in an ectotherm (Iguana iguana). Ectothermic animals regulate their body temperatures primarily by behavioral adjustment in relation to the thermal characteristics of the environment. Several studies have shown that some vertebrate ectotherms may show a daily pattern of body temperature selection when given a choice of environmental temperature. The pattern of body temperature selection free-runs when the animals are kept in constant darkness, demonstrating the existence of circadian regulation. To test whether there might also be a low amplitude circadian rhythm of body temperature itself, we examined the pattern of body temperature and locomotor activity of the lizard Iguana iguana held in a constant environmental temperature. Both variables were recorded for 3 days in a light:dark cycle and then for 10 days in constant dim light (0.1 lux). Under these conditions the body temperature of the lizard oscillates with a circadian period as does the locomotor behavior. These results demonstrate for the first time that ectothermic animals may display physiologically generated circadian rhythms of body temperature similar to those recorded in endotherms. In some animals the circadian rhythms of body temperature and locomotor activity showed different free-running periods, demonstrating that the body temperature rhythm was not caused by locomotor activity and suggesting internal desyncronization of the two rhythms.",Immunology

On the day before surgery, resting ventilatory values including minute volume (VE) and tidal volume (VT), and ventilatory response to progressive hyperoxic hypercapnia (VE/PE'CO2) were measured. On the day of surgery, the same measurements were repeated 30 min after extradural injection. Ventilatory values at rest were not altered after extradural injection. Mean VE/PE'CO2 decreased significantly after extradural morphine (P = 0.002) and increased (P = 0.011) after extradural lignocaine. Mean VE 7.3 (VE at PE'CO2 7.3 kPa) decreased significantly after extradural morphine (P < 0.001) and increased after extradural lignocaine (P = 0.047).

With successive stripping of the skin the amount of tissue adhering to the tape decreased. Exposure of the upper arm to 2% SA for 6 h increased the skin material on the tape strips significantly. No significant increase was recorded after 3-hour exposure, or after exposure to 0.5% SA. Neither did the exposure to 10% urea for 3 or 6 h influence the amount of skin adhering to the tape significantly.

Three patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that remitted with the development of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have been described in the literature, and this has contributed to the belief that RA and HIV infection or the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cannot coexist. However, a computerized MEDLINE literature search revealed reports of 4 patients who did have active RA and AIDS or HIV infection, as well as other case reports of symmetric polyarthritis compatible with RA in patients with HIV infection. Each of the patients whose RA remitted had received standard disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy, and 1 of the 3 had a normal T helper:T suppressor ratio at the time of remission. Of the 4 previously reported patients with active RA and AIDS or HIV infection, all had decreased numbers of T helper lymphocytes. The present report describes a fifth patient with both RA and AIDS and reviews the data concerning the coexistence of these 2 diseases. It appears that active RA may indeed coexist with AIDS. It remains to be seen under what settings HIV may have a disease-modifying effect in RA. These issues have important implications regarding the pathogenesis and therapy of RA, especially in terms of the role of CD4+ lymphocytes and anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody therapy.",Immunology

The mechanism of T22 inhibition of HIV-1 replication may involve T22 competition with HIV-1 for attachment sites on the plasma membrane of targeted cells. Here we find that the T22 peptide binds to the CD4 molecule in affinity columns. We also find that antiserum to CD4 inhibits cell attachment to T22. Further CD4+ transfected cells attach to T22 while their parental cells which do not express CD4 do not attach to T22.

7487928,"Identification of the integrin alpha 3 beta 1 as a component of a partially purified A-system amino acid transporter from Ehrlich cell plasma membranes. We have previously reported [McCormick and Johnstone (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 7877-7881] the partial purification of the Na(+)-dependent A-system amino acid transporter from Ehrlich cell plasma membranes and have suggested that a 120-130 kDa peptide, a major component of the purified fraction [octyl glucoside (OG) extract], is involved in Na(+)-dependent amino acid transport. In the present study, N-terminal sequence analysis of the 120-130 kDa peptide revealed a sequence similar to that of the alpha 3 subunit of the integrin alpha 3 beta 1. The presence of alpha 3 beta 1 was confirmed by Western blots of the OG extract probed with anti-alpha 3 or -beta 1 antibodies. Western blots also showed that an antibody originally raised against the 120-130 kDa peptide crossreacts with both the alpha 3 and beta 1 integrin subunits. Co-purification of alpha 3 beta 1 and Na(+)-dependent transport activity suggested that the two activities might be associated. Evidence that alpha 3 plays a role in transport is shown by the fact that an antibody against human alpha 3, but not beta 1, removed transport activity (approximately 25% loss) from cholate-solubilized Ehrlich membranes. Further purification of OG extracts using concanavalin A and wheat-germ lectin columns resulted in the separation of transport activity from the bulk (but not all) of alpha 3 beta 1 integrin without loss of the transport activity. These results indicate that the integrin itself is not essential for amino acid transport. Reconstitution of a purified alpha 3 beta 1-depleted protein fraction showed high levels of Na(+)-dependent, alpha-methylaminoisobutyric-acid-inhibitable amino acid transport in proteoliposomes, whereas reconstituted integrin alone showed little transport activity. However, in the integrin-depleted fractions, high amino acid uptake occurred in K+ which compromised the accurate measurement of the Na(+)-dependent component of uptake. The data suggest that alpha 3 may be associated with the A-system transporter and may modulate the activity of this carrier. Moreover, transfection of K562 and RD cells with human alpha 3 and alpha 2 cDNA showed that the former but not the latter increased A-system transport, thus providing more direct evidence that alpha 3 may modulate A-system transport activity.",Immunology
7487901,"Multiple signalling pathways involved in the stimulation of fatty acid and glycogen synthesis by insulin in rat epididymal fat cells. We have investigated the signalling pathways involved in the stimulation of glycogen and fatty acid synthesis by insulin in rat fat cells using wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and rapamycin, which blocks activation of p70 ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p70S6K). Insulin produced a decrease in the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3 which is likely to be important in the observed stimulation of glycogen synthase. Both of these actions were found to be sensitive to inhibition by wortmannin. Activation of three processes is involved in the stimulation of fatty acid synthesis from glucose by insulin, namely glucose uptake, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. Whereas wortmannin largely abolished the effects of insulin on glucose utilization and acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, it was without effect on the stimulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Although epidermal growth factor stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase to a greater extent than insulin, it was unable to mimic the effect of insulin on glycogen synthase, glycogen synthase kinase-3, glucose utilization, acetyl-CoA carboxylase or pyruvate dehydrogenase. Rapamycin also failed to have any appreciable effect on stimulation of these parameters by insulin, although it did block the effect of insulin on p70S6K. We conclude that the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is required for the effects of insulin on glycogen synthesis, glucose uptake and acetyl-Co-AN carboxylase, but is not involved in signalling to pyruvate dehydrogenase. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase or p70S6K, however, does not appear to be sufficient to bring about the stimulation of fatty acid or glycogen synthesis. Altogether is seems likely that at least four distinct signalling pathways are involved in the effects of insulin on rat fat cells.",Immunology

7487809,"Preconditioning with sodium deficits to improve orthostatic tolerance in rats. We hypothesized that prior deficits in total body sodium would improve the subsequent ability of non-hypovolemic rats to maintain arterial pressure when subjected to an orthostatic challenge. This hypothesis was based on similarities in the response of neurohumoral cardiovascular control systems to lower-body negative pressure and negative sodium balance. Sodium deficits were induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats for 7-8 d by feeding sodium restricted diets, or by administering furosemide daily. After this, rats were allowed to regain a positive sodium balance for 1 d by increasing dietary intake or withholding furosemide, and receiving additional normal saline intraperitoneally. Rats subjected to these protocols had equal plasma volumes at the time they were anesthetized and evaluated for orthostatic tolerance. Furosemide-treated rats maintained a higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) than controls (70 +/- 10 vs 34 +/- 9 mm Hg) when rotated to a 90 degrees head-up position for 20 s. Rats receiving the lowest dietary sodium maintained the highest MAP (89 +/- 8 mm Hg) when placed at 60 degrees head-up for 5 min. Both before and during the orthostatic challenges, prior furosemide treatment was associated with a higher peripheral resistance, while prior dietary restriction of sodium was associated with a higher cardiac output. We conclude that preconditioning consisting of chronic sodium deficits can improve orthostatic tolerance in this animal model. The hemodynamic data indicate the different modes of preconditioning may have their primary effect on different determinants of orthostatic tolerance.",Immunology

The increase in postvoiding volume occurred more frequently in patients with diminished urinary flow rate before urethropexy (60% of the cases). The Raz technique showed less urodynamic data of voiding disturbances. Urethropexy causes voiding disturbance.

Various animal models have been used for the study of hematopoiesis, from early stages in the visceral yolk sac or its analog, to the later stages where hematopoiesis is observed in intraembryonic areas surrounding the aorta, genital ridge and pro/mesonephros. Using the mouse as a model, we describe what is known about mammalian embryonic hematopoiesis and put it in the context of hematopoietic cell formation in avian, amphibian and fish embryos. Evolutionary comparisons and recent experimental evidence show that there are two embryonic sites of developing hematopoietic activity in the mouse before fetal liver hematopoiesis and suggest that, during ontogeny, two successive waves of hematopoietic activity may contribute to the blood system of the adult.",Immunology

In this study we evaluated three immunologic methods for confirmation of clinical diagnosis of Chagas' disease, in 120 in-patients. The skin testing with the T12E antigen and the immunofluorescence were positive in 10% of cases. The hemagglutination was positive in 14.1% of these patients. The co-positivity of results of skin-testing with hemagglutination and of this latter with immunofluorescence reached 7.5% of cases. However, only 5% of co-positivity was achieved with results of skin testing, immunofluorescence and hemagglutination. Furthermore, 19.1% of the in-patients showed at least one out of these exams to be positive. The specificity of the skin testing paralleled that of the immunofluorescence. The sensitivity of these exams, however, was lower than that obtained by the indirect hemagglutination. These data show that the skin testing with T12E antigen allows the diagnosis of Chagas' disease by a simple and handy method.",Immunology

In contrast to the great number of etiological models for bulimia nervosa, few conceptions determine the therapeutic practice. Two of these models, the ego-psychological model of reduced impulse-control and the behavioural model focussing the influence of ""restrained eating"" are empirically compared. Both models are not supposed to be of ubiquitous validity, but valid for subgroups of bulimic women. The theoretical assumptions are translated into structural equations and a sample of 127 bulimic women is divided up into 2 subsamples according to criteria which are presumed to define the validity of both etiological models. In agreement with the assumptions the ""restrained eating"" model shows the better ""fit"" with the one subsample while the ego-psychological model is more adequate for the other group.",Immunology
7480536,"Differential modulation of antipredator defensive behavior in Swiss-Webster mice following acute or chronic administration of imipramine and fluoxetine. The Mouse Defense Test Battery (MDTB) has been designed to assess defensive reactions in Swiss-Webster mice to situations associated with a natural predator, the rat. Primary measures taken before, during and after predator confrontation comprise escape attempts, predator assessment, defensive attack and flight. Previous reports from this laboratory have shown that the panic-promoting drug yohimbine potentiated flight behavior, while long-term treatment with the panicolytic agent alprazolam reduced this response. In order to evaluate further the possibility that the MDTB may represent an effective animal model of panic attacks, the present study investigated the behavioral effect of imipramine and fluoxetine, two serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) known to alleviate panic symptoms when given on a repeated basis. Both drugs were administered acutely and chronically (one daily IP injection for 21 days) at 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg. Our results showed that a single dose of imipramine or fluoxetine strongly potentiated flight reactions in response to an approaching predator and increased defensive attack toward the rat. This was in contrast to chronic treatment with each drug which dramatically decreased flight responses and defensive attack behaviors. In addition, long-term administration with both SRIs produced a reliable attenuation of predator assessment activities. Taken together, these findings suggest an acute anxiogenic-like effect of imipramine and fluoxetine followed by a fear/anxiety reducing effect after repeated administrations. These results support clinical observations revealing an acute anxiogenic effect of SRIs followed by an anxiolytic and/or panicolytic effect after chronic use, and support previous results suggesting that the MDTB may be useful for the investigation of panic-modulating agents.",Immunology

Complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding a novel member of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family has been isolated from colon carcinoma tissue. Colon carcinoma kinase 4 (CCK-4) mRNA is highly expressed in human lung tissue and at lower levels in the thyroid gland and ovary. While no mRNA was found in human adult colon tissues, expression varied remarkably in colon carcinoma-derived cell lines. CCK-4 cDNA encodes a chicken KLG-related, 1071 amino acid-long transmembrane glycoprotein containing several genetic alterations within the RTK consensus sequences. These define CCK-4 as a catalytically inactive member of the RTK family of proteins and, in analogy to HER3, suggest a potentially tumor-characteristic role as a signal amplifier or modulator for an as yet unidentified kinase-competent partner.",Immunology

Two weeks after the operation the middle ear cavity was covered by moderately differentiated epithelium in the animals which had only the mucosa removed. In animals with inserted Silastic sheeting, infection slowed down the regeneration process. During the 2 months of postoperative observation, the surface of the cavity appeared to be rough, and there was intensive fibrin deposition over the mucosa. It is concluded that normal middle ear mucosa regenerates rapidly after surgical removal.

A regional Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the highest levels of NF-L mRNA in the adult mouse brain are present in brain stem followed by mid-brain, with lower levels found in neocortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus. The study was extended to the cellular level over course of postnatal development using in situ hybridization. This developmental analysis revealed that the expression of NF-L mRNA closely follows the differentiation pattern of many large neurons during postnatal neurogenesis. Neurons which differentiate early such as Purkinje, mitral, pyramidal, and large neurons of brain stem and thalamic nuclei, expressed high levels of NF-L mRNA at postnatal day 1. Early expression of NF-L mRNA may be required for the maintenance of the extensive neurofilament protein networks that are detected within the axons of larger neurons. Smaller neurons which differentiate later, such as dentate gyrus granule cells, small pyramidal and granule cells of the neocortex, and granule cells of the cerebellum, exhibit a delayed expression of NF-L mRNA.",Immunology

7476096,"Mutational analysis of the putative leukotoxin transport genes in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. The periodontal pathogen, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, produces leukotoxin, a protein that specifically lyses host defense cells. The leukotoxin is similar in sequence and operon organization to the Escherichia coli alpha-hemolysin and other members of the RTX family of toxins. However, unlike the other RTX toxins, the A. actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin is not secreted from the cell and instead remains associated with the outer membrane. Nonetheless, the A. actinomycetemcomitans Ikt operon contains two genes, IktB and IktD, that appear analagous to the toxin localization genes found in the other Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, to determine the roles of these putative transport genes in A. actinomycetemcomitans, we have used insertional mutagenesis to generate mutant strains lacking functional LktB and/or LktD. When either IktD or both IktB and IktD were inactivated, the level of detectable leukotoxin protein in the cell decreased significantly. However, the IktB and IktD mutations had no effect on the levels of leukotoxin RNA. Thus, the lack of LktB and LktD proteins must affect LktA synthesis post-transcriptionally. It is proposed that this is an indirect effect of leukotoxin mislocalization in IktB- and IktD- mutants. Finally, analysis of the mutants revealed that LktB and LktD are not essential for the formation of extracellular membrane vesicles in A. actinomycetemcomitans.",Immunology
7476092,"The construction and characterization of colanic acid deficient mutants in an extraintestinal isolate of Escherichia coli (O4/K54/H5). Extraintestinal strains of Escherichia coli possess a variety of virulence factors that enable them to cause disease. These strains express a group 2 capsular polysaccharide which is important in the pathogenic process. Extraintestinal strains evaluated to date are also capable of producing the group 1 capsular polysaccharide colanic acid. The blood isolate CP9 (O4/K54/H5) constitutively produces the group 2, K54 capsule but can be induced to produce colanic acid. In this report we assess whether colanic acid contributes to the pathogenesis of this extraintestinal pathogen. CP9 and its derivatives that are deficient in their ability to produce colanic acid (TR94), the K54 group 2 capsule +/- colanic acid (CP9.137, TR1374) and the O4 specific antigen +/- colanic acid (CP921,CP925) were used to test whether the group 1 capsule colanic acid conferred protection against the bactericidal effects of serum and recombinant bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (rBPI-23) in vitro. Additionally, CP9, CP9.137 and TR94 were evaluated in the rat granuloma pouch, an in vivo model for localized infection, and by intraperitoneal inoculation into mice, a systemic infection model. In summary, the inability of CP9 to produce colanic acid in the presence or absence of its K54 and O4 antigens had no effect on its ability to survive these host defenses in vitro and did not affect its virulence in these two in vivo models of infection.",Immunology

The role of T-cell subsets in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection was investigated by using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to selectively deplete gnotobiotic calves of CD4+, CD8+, or WC1+ gamma delta T-cell receptor+ lymphocytes. Injection of these MAbs produced specific reductions of the target cell populations in the circulation and tissues. Ten days after RSV infection, immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG1, and IgA antibodies were detected in sera and lung washings from control calves. Depletion of CD8+ T cells had no effect on either the serum or local antibody responses to RSV, whereas depletion of CD4+ T cells suppressed the antibody responses in two of three calves. The IgM and IgA responses were significantly increased in the lung washings of calves from which WC1+ T cells were depleted. Depletion of CD4+ or WC1+ T cells caused no significant delay in virus clearance, although an increase in the extent of pneumonic consolidation was observed in anti-CD4-treated calves. Nasopharyngeal excretion of RSV was prolonged in calves depleted of CD8+ T cells, and virus was isolated in high titers from lung washings of these animals 10 days after infection, whereas virus had been cleared from lung washings of all other animals. The delayed virus clearance was associated with an increase in the severity of pneumonic consolidation in three of four of the calves from which CD8+ T cells were depleted. This study shows that CD8+ T cells play a dominant role in the recovery of calves from RSV infection.",Immunology

Given choices of how to sort novel artificial objects varying in both aspects, children in experiments 1 and 2 chose perceptual features with few exceptions. Experiments 3 and 4 presented the same objects to children in a concept-learning task, where nonsense labels were to be learned for perceptually or functionally based categories; the latter were much more difficult. Experiment 5 was an extension of the first 2 experiments, except that more familiar objects were employed; comparable results were found.

The enzyme activity decreased markedly in the hypothyroid state produced by either thyroidectomy, hypophysectomy or by administration of propylthiouracil (PTU). One large dose (25 microgram/100 g body weight) of T3 given intraperitoneally caused a rapid recovery of the enzyme activity within 24 h either in the presence or absence of the pituitary. The enzyme activity of both free and chromatin-bound enzyme changed in parallel throughout. A similar recovery was noted after daily subcutaneous injections of a physiological dose (1 microgram/100 g body weight) of T3 for about 3 weeks. Analyses of subfractions of the enzyme indicated that only IB-type enzyme (the enzyme fraction containing the whole set of subunits) changed in response to thyroid hormone action, also irrespective of the presence or absence of the pituitary. The possibility that thyroid hormone is a major physiological regulator of the synthesis of RNA polymerase I in rat liver is discussed.",Immunology

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in amniotic fluid was assayed directly by a reaction rate method at 30 degrees C using acetylthiocholine iodide as substrate and ethopropazine as a safe 'pseudo' cholinesterase inhibitor. Fresh samples from 101 normal pregnancies of 14-24 weeks gestation had a mean AChE activity of 2.56 u/l (SD 1.10). Elevated levels of AChE were found in association with open spina bifida (5.5-20.4 u/l), anencephaly (10.2-19.5 u/l), exomphalos (2.7-15.6 u/l), intrauterine death (30.2-59.3 u/l) and Turner's syndrome (36.4 u/l) but not with closed spina bifida or rhesus isoimmunisation. When AChE activity was expressed as a percentage of the total cholinesterase activity ('percentage AChE'), there was a good correlation between AChE activity and 'percentage AChE' in normal pregnancies and the values associated with the 37 pregnancies affected by open neural tube defects (NTD) fell outside the 99.9 per cent confidence limits of the normal group.

Inhibitors of natural killer (NK) cell activity in cell-culture supernatants, believed to be antigens recognized by NK cells, were defined by their ability to inhibit NK cells in 51Cr-release cytotoxic assays. Supernatants from cultures of melanoma cells and Chang cells were used as the source of the antigen. Partial characterization by a number of sequential separation procedures suggested that the antigens were glycoproteins in the size range 120-140,000 daltons which had affinity for both concanavalin A and wheat germ lectin. Inhibitory activity was destroyed by trypsin digestion, but was resistant to neuraminidase and a number of physical procedures. Addition of supernatants to NK assays against a number of different target cells indicated that inhibition was restricted to certain target cells. This indicated that the inhibition of NK cells was not non-specific, and that the antigens were not expressed on all target cells. These studies provide a basis for further analysis of antigens recognized by NK cells, and allow investigation of their role in vivo in tumour-bearing hosts.",Immunology

Epidirithromycin is its isomer in which the methoxyethoxymethyl substituent has the opposite (S) configuration. Both compounds readily epimerize in solution, reaching an equilibrium ratio of 85:15 in favor of dirithromycin, given sufficient time. The rate of interconversion is dependent upon pH, temperature, and solvent. An enriched sample of epidirithromycin (95% purity) was synthesized by condensing erythromycylamine and 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)acetaldehyde in diethyl ether as the reaction solvent, and the product was fully characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high-pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis. Both oxazine derivatives readily hydrolyze to erythromycylamine, so all three compounds exhibit the same antibiotic activity in vitro. In order to determine whether dirithromycin itself possesses significant antimicrobial activity without initial hydrolysis to erythromycylmine, inhibition of cell-free ribosomal protein synthesis was measured under conditions which were adapted to minimize hydrolysis, as measured by analytical HPLC in parallel experiments.

From 1982 to 1993, 37 unselected patients with persistent (11) or recurrent hyperparathyroidism (26) were treated. Twenty-one had DA and 16 had hyperplasia. DAs were defined as two abnormal and two normal parathyroid glands. Patients with persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism caused by DA were older and had more muscle weakness, neuropsychiatric disorders, constipation, and weight loss (p < 0.001) than patients with persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism caused by hyperplasia. Nephrolithiasis was more common in patients with recurrent hyperparathyroidism caused by hyperplasia than in patients with recurrent hyperparathyroidism caused by DA (p < 0.001).

7491521,"DNA index and ploidy distinguish normal human parathyroids from parathyroid adenomas and primary hyperplastic parathyroids. The goal of this study was to identify factors that might aid in diagnosis and intraoperative management of hyperparathyroidism. We analyzed biopsy specimens of 242 parathyroids from 159 patients by use of flow cytometry and image cytometry (ICM) for DNA index (DI), defined as the content of nuclear DNA compared with that expected for a DNA diploid standard, for proliferative index (PI), and for ploidy (diploid versus aneuploid or tetraploid). True normal and normal parathyroids from patients with solitary adenomas were uniformly diploid. Abnormal ploidy (aneuploidy or tetraploidy) was identified frequently in adenomas and occasionally in hyperplasias with the exception that multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) biopsy specimens were uniformly diploid. DI for adenomas was similar to that for hyperplasias, and DI of both was higher than for normal glands. ICM-DI correlated positively with flow cytometry-DI and patient age and inversely with serum parathyroid hormone. PI was relatively low in all groups but was higher for hyperplasias versus normal parathyroids from patients with solitary adenomas and MEN versus non-MEN. PI correlated inversely with patient age. DI by ICM differentiates normal from abnormal parathyroids. DI might influence extent of resection in two- and three-gland hyperplasia and selection of the most appropriate gland for autografting and cryopreservation in patients with four-gland hyperplasia.",Immunology
7491279,"Properties of voltage-gated currents of microglia developed using macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Microglia were isolated from a murine neonatal brain cell culture in which their development had been stimulated by supplementation with the macrophage/microglial growth factor macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique, voltage-gated membrane currents were recorded from these microglial cells. Hyperpolarization induced inward rectifying K+ currents, as described for microglia from untreated cultures. These currents activated negative to the K+ equilibrium potential and, with a strong hyperpolarization, displayed time-dependent inactivation. The inactivation was abolished when extracellular NaCl was replaced by N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMG), thereby indicating a partial block of this K+ conductance by Na+. Inward rectifying currents were also blocked by extracellularly applied Cs+ or Ba2+. They were slightly diminished following treatment with extracellular tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) but were not affected by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). Upon long lasting depolarizing voltage pulses to potentials positive to 0 mV, the cells exhibited a slowly activating H+ current which could be reduced by application of inorganic polyvalent cations (Ba2+, Cd2+, Co2+, La3+, Ni2+, Zn2+) as well as by 4-AP or TEA. Based on their kinetics and pharmacological characteristics, both currents detected on M-CSF-grown microglia are suggested to correspond to the inward rectifier and the H+ current of macrophages.",Immunology

7490834,"Correlation between the International Prostatic Symptom Score and a pressure-flow study in the evaluation of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia. We examined the relationship between the International Prostatic Symptom Score (I-PSS) and the occurrence of bladder outlet obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The American Urological Association developed a questionnaire to quantify the severity of symptoms resulting from BPH. A further question relating the impact of BPH to the quality of life was subsequently added. This questionnaire has been adopted by the World Health Organization and is known as the I-PSS. There are 4 questions related to obstructive symptoms and 3 related to irritative symptoms. Scores of 0 to 7, 8 to 19 and 20 to 35 represent mild, moderate and severe symptoms, respectively. During an 18-month interval the I-PSS questionnaire was administered to 258 patients 50 to 81 years old (mean age 63 years) with BPH. A pressure-flow study was used to determine the presence of bladder outlet obstruction in 227 patients. Based on the scores, the patients were divided into 31 with mild, 116 with moderate and 111 with severe obstruction. The pressure-flow study was not conducted on patients with a mild symptom score. Of the patients with a severe symptom score 92 (82.9%) had bladder outlet obstruction, compared to 62 (53.4%) with a moderate symptom score. Statistical analysis (Pearson chi-square test) showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the symptoms and the presence of bladder outlet obstruction. Thus, when the I-PSS was greater than 28, the probability of bladder outlet obstruction was more than 0.91. Stratification of the results according to the obstructive (0 to 20) and irritative (0 to 15) symptoms of the I-PSS yielded a significant positive correlation between obstructive symptoms and the presence of bladder outlet obstruction. Thus, when the obstructive symptom score was greater than 15, the probability of bladder outlet obstruction was greater than 0.91. When the total I-PSS is greater than 28 or the obstructive symptom score is greater than 15, a pressure-flow study must be avoided.",Immunology

This study evaluates the postsurgical stability of segmentalized Le Fort I osteotomies with miniplate fixation in patients with maxillary hypoplasia. Eighteen adult patients who had undergone segmentalized Le Fort I osteotomy for anterior and inferior repositioning of their hypoplastic maxilla were studied radiographically. The positional change of five maxillary landmarks (PNS, ANS, A, U1, and UM) were measured on serial cephalometric radiographs according to a reference frame constructed by using the SN line for superimposition, sella as the origin of the coordinates, and a line parallel to Frankfort horizontal plane as the x-axis. The positional changes of all variables were measured twice, and the means were calculated for analysis. The paired t-test was used for statistical analysis. Statistically significant mean vertical change (P < .01) was found in the anterior maxilla, with U1 having moved up by 27.8% (1.5 mm) of its initial downward surgical movement by 1 year postoperatively. U1 and UM had moved forward 2.0 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively (P < .01) by 1 year postoperatively, but the bony landmarks had no statistically significant change in their horizontal positions. Although statistically significant postsurgical changes were found at 1 year postoperatively, overcorrection is not recommended because of the large individual variation observed and the relatively small magnitude of the relapse.",Immunology
7490621,"Brain edema and neurological status with rapid infusion of lactated Ringer's or 5% dextrose solution following head trauma. Rapid infusion of 0.25 ml/g of 0.9% saline over 30 minutes has been shown to have no effect on electrolyte balance, neurological severity score (NSS), or brain edema, following closed head trauma (CHT). Rapid infusion of the same volume of 5% dextrose solution decreased blood sodium concentration, increased edema, and decreased NSS following CHT. In the present study the authors examined the effect of rapid infusion (30 minutes) of smaller volumes of 5% dextrose (0.08 ml/g and 0.16 ml/g) and of 0.25 ml/g lactated Ringer's solution on blood electrolyte concentrations, plasma osmolality, brain edema, and NSS. The purposes of this study were to determine whether rapid infusion of a large volume of lactated Ringer's solution could be given after CHT without increasing mortality or brain edema or producing electrolyte disturbances, and whether small volumes of 5% dextrose could be infused with few or none of the deleterious effects expected from large volumes of 5% dextrose. One hundred eighteen rats, which survived halothane anesthesia and CHT, were randomly assigned to one of 15 experimental groups. Fluids were administered beginning 1 hour after scalp incision or CHT. The NSS, extent of edema, blood electrolyte concentrations, and plasma osmolality in the groups treated with lactated Ringer's solution were not significantly different from those values in the nontreated groups. In addition, the mortality rate after CHT was not increased by administration of lactated Ringer's solution. The groups treated with 5% dextrose solution showed a significantly higher mortality rate, but the NSSs of the surviving rats were not different from controls. None of the groups treated with 0.16 ml/g 5% dextrose solution survived 24 hours. Although blood glucose concentration increased to 1126 +/- 102 g% (mean +/- standard deviation) and 1568 +/- 283 g% and blood sodium concentration decreased to 110.4 +/- 4.6 mEq/L and 92.0 +/- 5.2 mEq/L in the groups treated with 0.08 ml/g and 0.16 ml/g of 5% dextrose solution, respectively, plasma osmolality was normal and no significant difference could be found between the brain tissue specific gravity of animals in the nontreated and 5% dextrose treatment groups. It is concluded that in the CHT model used in this study, the large volume of lactated Ringer's solution did not affect blood electrolyte concentration, neurological outcome, or formation of brain edema, whereas smaller volumes of 5% dextrose solution increased blood glucose and decreased blood sodium concentrations, did not affect plasma osmolality, and had a deleterious effect on neurological outcome.",Immunology
7490574,"Automaticity and word perception: evidence from Stroop and Stroop dilution effects. The Stroop effect is cut in half by adding a neutral word to the display. D. Kahneman and D. Chajczyk's (1983) ""attention capture"" account of ""Stroop dilution"" holds word recognition to be involuntary but strictly serial. The authors compared attention capture to 3 alternatives involving parallel rather than serial processing: In the lexicon, activation is divided among multiple words; postlexically, multiple words race for access to response processes; or prelexically, feature processing is degraded by multiple patterns whether or not they are words. Results support the latter. Multiple patterns are processed in parallel. If any are color words, Stroop effects occur but are reduced because any color word's input to lexical memory is lower in quality than if a single color word were the only pattern. Thus, lexical encoding is involuntary but can operate on several input representations in parallel, with effectiveness determined by input quality.",Immunology
7490502,"Inhibition of OH radical-induced strand break formation of poly(U) by Ru(bpy)32+ or Ru(phen)32+ attached to the polynucleotide. Reactions of OH radicals with poly(U) (polyuridylic acid) in the presence of Ru(bpy)32+ or Ru(phen)32+ in aqueous solutions were studied. OH radicals were produced by pulse radiolysis and their reactions with ruthenium complexes were measured spectrophotometrically under conditions were the complexes are attached to the polynucleotide. The OH radical adds to either the uracil moiety or the ruthenium complexes. The ratio of the radicals produced depends only on the ratio of their rate constants and the concentrations of poly(U) and ruthenium complexes. Similar results were obtained with uridine-5'-monosphosphate, where the ruthenium complexes are not attached to the nucleotide. Surprisingly, the yield of single-strand break formation from the OH adducts of uracil in poly(U) is much smaller than that expected on the basis of the yield measured in the absence of ruthenium complexes. Possible reasons for this behaviour are discussed.",Immunology
7490281,"Point mutation of adenosine triphosphate-binding motif generated rigor kinesin that selectively blocks anterograde lysosome membrane transport. In the study of motor proteins, the molecular mechanism of mechanochemical coupling, as well as the cellular role of these proteins, is an important issue. To assess these questions we introduced cDNA of wild-type and site-directed mutant kinesin heavy chains into fibroblasts, and analyzed the behavior of the recombinant proteins and the mechanisms involved in organelle transports. Overexpression of wild-type kinesin significantly promoted elongation of cellular processes. Wild-type kinesin accumulated at the tips of the long processes, whereas the kinesin mutants, which contained either a T93N- or T93I mutation in the ATP-binding motif, tightly bound to microtubules in the center of the cells. These mutant kinesins could bind to microtubules in vitro, but could not dissociate from them even in the presence of ATP, and did not support microtubule motility in vitro, thereby indicating rigor-type mutations. Retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as lysosome dispersion, was shown to be a microtubule-dependent, plus-end-directed movement. The latter was selectively blocked in the rigor-mutant cells, although the microtubule minus-end-directed motion of lysosomes was not affected. We found the point mutations that make kinesin motor in strong binding state with microtubules in vitro and showed that this mutant causes a dominant effect that selectively blocks anterograde lysosome membrane transports in vivo.",Immunology
7490265,"Phosphatidylserine-specific transbilayer lipid translocation in synaptosomal plasma membranes from Narke japonica. We measured the translocation of exogenous radiolabeled phospholipid probes from the outer to the inner leaflet in the synaptosomal plasma membranes from the electric organs of Narke japonica, a Japanese marine ray. These radioactive probes can provide a convenient and highly sensitive means of measuring the translocation kinetics of phospholipids between outer and inner leaflets of biomembranes that are available only with low yield [Anzai et al. (1993) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1151, 69-75]. Translocation kinetics revealed that the behavior of phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) differed. PS quickly disappeared from the outer leaflet of the bilayer. The translocation of PE and PC was slow and about 80% of the PE- and PC-probes remained in the outer leaflet at 3 h. These results differ from those of translocation in erythrocyte membranes measured using the same probes, where aminophospholipid translocase translocated both PS and PE from the outer to the inner leaflet of the bilayer, although the rate was faster for PS than for PE. In this study, the translocation was apparently PS-specific, and it was inhibited by SH reagent or intrasynaptosomal ATP-depletion. These findings clearly demonstrate that the translocation is driven by an ATP-dependent protein, which has apparent PS-specificity. We suggest that there is a translocase other than erythrocyte-type aminophospholipid translocase in synaptosomal plasma membranes from N. japonica.",Immunology

We examined the capacity of purified rat peritoneal connective tissue-type mast cells (PMC) to express mRNA for several cytokines. Stimulation of PMC with anti-IgE for 4 hr induced the expression of mRNA encoding interleukin-5 (IL-5), IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Unstimulated PMC expressed detectable mRNA for TNF-alpha but not for the other four cytokines. Incubation of PMC with cyclosporin A (CsA) or dexamethasone (DEX), each at 10(-6) M for 24 hr, significantly inhibited the induced expression of mRNA for each of the five cytokines, and also inhibited release of biologically active TNF-alpha. Throughout these experiments mRNA levels of the housekeeping gene G3PDH were not altered by stimulation with anti-IgE or incubation with CsA or DEX. We conclude that immunological activation of rat PMC induces gene expression of several cytokines and that expression of these genes can be inhibited by immunosuppressive drugs.",Immunology

Fetal rat hepatocytes incubated in the absence of hormonal signals, or under proliferative (presence of epidermal growth factor [EGF]) or differentiative (presence of dexamethasone) culture conditions, showed responsiveness to interleukin-6 (IL-6). Northern blotting analysis for some typical acute phase genes such as haptoglobin and other proteins not previously identified as acute-phase reactants, such as alpha-fetoprotein, beta 2-microglobulin, and fibronectin, showed a positive modulation by IL-6, in a dose-dependent manner. However, a well-characterized negative acute-phase reactant such as albumin was not responsive to IL-6. The well-established synergism between glucocorticoids and IL-6 on inducing transcription is absent in fetal hepatocytes. Conversely, the combination of IL-6 and EGF produced different patterns of expression, depending on the messenger RNA (mRNA) analyzed. Thus, EGF abolished the increased mRNA levels of haptoglobin caused by IL-6 but had no effect on other genes such as alpha-fetoprotein and fibronectin.",Immunology
7489943,"Corticotropin releasing hormone in colonic mucosa in patients with ulcerative colitis. Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) is a key hormone in integrated response to stress, acting as the major regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Recently, local production of CRH has been detected in normal human colonic enterochromaffin cells. CRH is locally secreted in granulomatous and arthritic tissues in rats and humans, where it seems to act as a local proinflammatory agent. To find out if CRH is present in colonic tissues of patients with ulcerative colitis, this study examined the expression of this peptide in the large bowel of patients with ulcerative colitis. Colonic tissues of patients with ulcerative colitis obtained by endoscopic biopsy were immunostained with anti-CRH antibody. CRH messenger (m) RNA was also examined in biopsy specimens of ulcerative colitis by the reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction method and by in situ hybridisation. Considerably enhanced expression of immunoreactive CRH was found in mucosal inflammatory cells. Intense staining with anti-CRH antibody was also shown in mucosal macrophages. CRH mRNA was expressed in mucosal epithelial cells. The expression of immunoreactive CRH in colonic mucosal epithelial cells of ulcerative colitis slightly increased, but not significantly, compared with normal colonic mucosal epithelial cells. These results suggest that CRH may play a part in the modulation of intestinal immune and inflammatory system, and as a modulator in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis.",Immunology
7489930,"Lymphocytic gastritis and Helicobacter pylori infection in gastric lymphoma. Lymphocytic gastritis and primary gastric lymphoma are rare conditions with unknown aetiology. It has recently been suggested that Helicobacter pylori has a role in the pathogenesis of both of them. The occurrence of lymphocytic gastritis and H pylori was studied in a series of patients with primary gastric lymphoma. The cases of primary gastric lymphomas (n = 35) diagnosed in years 1970-1993 were identified. The specimens of 22 cases contained gastric mucosa sufficiently so that the number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes, severity of gastritis, and occurrence of H pylori could be studied. Lymphocytic gastritis was detected in seven of 22 patients (32%), and in most cases both in antral and body mucosa. Atrophy of the body glands was significantly more severe in lymphocytic gastritis patients. H pylori was detected in 13 of all 22 patients (59%); two of seven lymphocytic gastritis patients (29%), and 11 of 15 (73%) of patients without lymphocytic gastritis were H pylori positive. Patients with gastric lymphoma have significantly increased prevalence of lymphocytic gastritis. Rarity of H pylori in these patients might be connected with atrophic changes in body mucosa. Further studies are needed to show the significance of lymphocytic gastritis as a precursor of gastric lymphoma.",Immunology

Purification and characterization revealed the inhibitor to be spermine, a polyamine known to be locally abundant in the prostate. These results suggest that endogenous polyamine can negatively regulate the growth of prostatic carcinoma cells at their primary site in vivo and may explain the slow rate of primary tumour expansion in the prostate.",Immunology
7489325,"A reappraisal of the role of the various opioid receptor subtypes in cell-mediated immunity. Opioid peptides have been shown by several studies to modulate various parameters of the immune response, but scant experimental findings exist on the role played by specific opioid receptor subtypes in the control of immune mechanisms. This study focuses on the in vitro influences of [Trp4,Asn7]dermorphin, a mu-selective agonist, [D-Ala2]deltorphin I, a delta-selective agonist and U50,488, a kappa-selective agonist, on the proliferative response of splenocytes to concanavalin A (Con A). [Trp4,Asn7]dermorphin at low concentrations (10(-11P) and 10(-12) M) enhanced the proliferative response to Con A, whereas higher concentrations (10(-6) to 10(-7) M) inhibited it. Both effects were antagonized by naloxone. [D-Ala2]deltorphin I at very low concentrations (10(-12) to 10(-13) M) also produced a significant increase in the proliferative response of splenocytes to Con A. This effect was significantly antagonized by natrindole, a specific delta-receptor antagonist. Finally U50,488 at concentrations ranging from 10(-8) to 10(-9) M inhibited the proliferative response to Con A. The effects of U50,488 were mediated by the stimulation of the kappa-opioid receptors, since a preincubation of splenocytes with the selective antagonist norbinaltorphimine significantly reduced or abolished the U50,488-induced suppression of the mitotic response. In conclusion, our results clearly indicate that the different opioid receptor subtypes play a different role in the control of immune mechanisms and suggest that immunoenhancing effects of opioid peptides are very likely due to the stimulation of mu- and delta-receptors, whereas the immunosuppressive effects are mediated through the stimulation of kappa-opioid receptors.",Immunology

The particulate fractions containing 22-kDa phosphoprotein were isolated from the cells labelled with [gamma-32P]ATP and used to study the dephosphorylation of the 22-kDa phosphoprotein. When the labelled fractions were incubated at 30 degrees C in the presence of 0.3 mM CaCl2 and 10 micrograms calmodulin, dephosphorylation of the 22-kDa phosphoprotein was evoked. Further addition of the type 2B phosphatase (Ca2+/calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase purified from bovine brain) resulted in a remarkable dephosphorylation of the 22-kDa phosphoprotein. Western immunoblotting showed that type 2B protein phosphatase exists in rat parotid acinar cells.

Study subjects were given infusions of 6,6,d2 glucose and 15N lysine for 6 hours. After infusion of the stable isotopes for 2 hours (basal period), dichloroacetate, which accelerates pyruvate oxidation, was given (dichloroacetate period). Leg blood flow was measured by indocyanine green dye dilution, and femoral artery and vein substrate concentrations were quantitated. The metabolic rates of glucose production, oxidation, and clearance; the whole-body protein breakdown rate; and the net efflux of amino acids from the leg were determined. In comparison with the healthy volunteers, septic patients had significant elevations in glucose production, oxidation, and clearance, accelerated protein catabolism, and greater net peripheral efflux of amino acids. Dichloroacetate significantly decreased glucose production and increased the percentage of glucose directed toward oxidation in both healthy volunteers and septic patients. However, this dichloroacetate-induced perturbation of glucose utilization had no significant effect on whole-body protein breakdown or the efflux of specific amino acids from the leg except for alanine, whose net efflux doubled (P < or = .05). The findings of this study demonstrate a universal acceleration in the metabolic rates of both intermediary glucose metabolism and protein/amino acid catabolism during sepsis.

Body composition was measured in 57 healthy males by 40K measurements and by multifrequency bioelectrical impedance. Intracellular resistance (Ricf) was calculated from the impedance values using the Cole-Cole model. From total body potassium, intracellular water (ICW) was calculated. In addition, in 14 subjects, total body water (TBW) and extracellular water (ECW) was measured using deuterium oxide dilution and bromide dilution, respectively. Prediction formulas from the literature from impedance at different frequencies were used to predict TBW and ECW, and ICW was calculated as the difference of predicted TBW and ECW. Predicted and measured values of TBW, ECW and ICW did not always show the same values as measured. Generally the ICW from potassium was well correlated with calculated ICW from impedance values, correlation coefficients varying from 0.68 to 0.79, depending on the used prediction formula. From the impedance index H2/Ricf, body weight and age, ICW from potassium was predicted with stepwise multiple regression. The prediction formula was ICW = 0.37065.H2/Ricf - 0.132.age + 0.105.weight + 12.2. The prediction error was 1.9 kg and the explained variance 0.69. The residuals of this prediction formula were dependent on the level of ICW as measured by potassium. The same phenomenon was observed when ICW was calculated as the difference of predicted TBW and ECW. The results show that multifrequency impedance is able to predict ICW, however, the prediction is influenced by body water distribution.",Immunology

Fourteen cases of pneumocystis carinii (PC) pneumonia in patients receiving low dose MTX have been previously reported. Yet, no case of PC pneumonia associated with low dose MTX has so far been reported in Japan. We report the first case in Japan of PC pneumonia occurring in a patient with rheumatoid vasculitis who was receiving low dose MTX. A 70-year old woman with 13 year history of RA presented with 3-day history of rapidly aggravating dyspnea, dry cough and fever. She had been receiving MTX 7.5 mg/week for 2.5 months because of her vasculitis symptoms. She had also been receiving prednisolone 7.5 mg/day which had been successfully tapered from an initial dose of 15 mg/day. At the time of her presentation with respiratory symptoms, all of her vasculitis symptoms had been alleviated. A chest radiograph revealed diffuse interstitial shadowing bilaterally and bilateral hilar and right lower lung field infiltrates. Her arterial blood gas showed severe hypoxemia (PaO2 27.7 torr).

A reverse genetic system for studying excision of the transposable element Ds1 in maize plants has been established previously.

In the presence of the Ac element, excision of Ds1 from the MSV genome results in the appearance of viral symptoms on the maize plants. Here, we used this system to study DNA sequences required in cis for excision of Ds1. The Ds1 element contains the Ac transposase binding motif AAACGG in only one of its subterminal regions (defined here as the 5' subterminal region). We showed that mutation of these motifs abolished completely the excision capacity of Ds1. This is the first direct demonstration that the transposase binding motifs are essential for excision. Mutagenesis with oligonucleotide insertions in the other (3') subterminal region resulted in elements with either a reduced or an increased excision efficiency, indicating that this subterminal region also has an important function.",Immunology

The influence of intracellular factors on current rectification of different subtypes of native alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionate receptors (AMPARs) was studied in rat brain slices by combining fast application of glutamate with patch pipette perfusion. 2. The peak current-voltage (I-V) relation of the AMPARs expressed in Bergmann glial cells of cerebellum and dentate gyrus (DG) basket cells of hippocampus was weakly rectifying in outside-out patches and nystatin-perforated vesicles, but showed a doubly rectifying shape with a region of reduced slope between 0 and +40 mV in nucleated patches. The I-V relation of AMPARs expressed in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurones was linear in all recording configurations. 3. Intracellular application of 25 microM spermine, a naturally occurring polyamine, blocked outward currents in outside-out patches from Bergmann glial cells and DG basket cells in a voltage-dependent manner, generating I-V relations with a doubly rectifying shape which were similar to those recorded in nucleated patches. AMPARs in CA3 pyramidal cell patches were unaffected by 25 microM spermine. 4. The half-maximal blocking concentration of spermine at +40 mV was 0.3 microM in Bergmann glial cell patches and 1.5 microM in DG basket cell patches, whereas it was much higher (> 100 microM) for CA3 pyramidal cell patches. Spermidine also affected current rectification, but with lower affinity. The block of outward current by polyamines following voltage jumps developed within < 0.5 ms. 5. We conclude that current rectification, rather than being an intrinsic property of the Ca(2+)-permeable AMPAR channel, is generated by polyamine block.",Immunology
7473187,"Mechanisms of ethanol-induced suppression of a primary antibody response in a mouse model for binge drinking. A previous study in this laboratory demonstrated that a single dose of EtOH causes thymic atrophy and that elevated levels of endogenous glucocorticoids are responsible, at least in part, for this effect. In the present study using the same animal model, the effect of EtOH on the T-dependent antibody response to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) was evaluated. In addition, the effects of EtOH on the SRBC-induced expression of selected cytokines known to enhance or regulate humoral responses were evaluated. Administration of EtOH at 5.0 to 7.0 g/kg to B6C3F1 mice significantly and dose-responsively inhibited the generation of antibody-forming cells (AFC) after immunization in vivo or in vitro in Mishell-Dutton cultures. In contrast, direct addition of EtOH or its major metabolites to Mishell-Dutton cultures did not decrease the AFC response. In vivo administration of EtOH caused substantial decreases in the SRBC-induced expression of interleukin (IL)-1-beta, IL-2 and IL-4 mRNA in the spleen, as indicated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The suppressed AFC responses and suppressed cytokine gene expression were prevented by RU 486, a potent glucocorticoid antagonist. Thus, suppression of cytokine gene expression by elevated levels of endogenous glucocorticoids may play a role in EtOH-induced suppression of the primary humoral response to SRBC. However, differences in dose-response patterns for suppression of cytokine gene expression and suppression of the AFC response suggest the involvement of additional factors.",Immunology

Anti-dopamine beta-hydroxylase immunotoxin (DHIT) is an antibody-targeted noradrenergic lesioning tool comprised of a monoclonal antibody against the noradrenergic enzyme, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, conjugated to saporin, a ribosome-inactivating protein. Noradrenergic-neuron specificity and completeness and functionality of sympathectomy were assessed. Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats were given 28.5, 85.7, 142 or 285 micrograms/kg DHIT i.v. Three days after injection, a 6% to 73% decrease in the neurons was found in the superior cervical ganglia of the animals. No loss of sensory, nodose and dorsal root ganglia, neurons was observed at the highest dose of DHIT. In contrast, the immunotoxin, 192-saporin (142 micrograms/kg), lesioned all three ganglia. To assess the sympathectomy, 2 wk after treatment (285 micrograms/kg), rats were anesthetized with urethane (1 g/kg) and cannulated in the femoral artery and vein. DHIT-treated animals' basal systolic blood pressure and heart rate were significantly lower than controls. Basal plasma norepinephrine levels were 41% lower in DHIT-treated animals than controls. Tyramine-stimulated release of norepinephrine in DHIT-treated rats was 27% of controls. Plasma epinephrine levels of DHIT animals were not reduced. DHIT-treated animals exhibited a 2-fold hypersensitivity to the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine. We conclude that DHIT selectively delivered saporin to noradrenergic neurons resulting in destruction of these neurons. Anti-dopamine beta-hydroxylase immunotoxin administration produces a rapid, irreversible sympathectomy.",Immunology

7472517,"The chronology of oligodendrocyte differentiation in the rat optic nerve: evidence for a signaling step initiating myelination in the CNS. In order to determine the signals that initiate axon myelination in the CNS, we have chronicled the differentiation of oligodendrocytes in the rat optic nerve and related this to the time course and spatial gradient seen for optic axon myelination. By using markers specific to the varying stages of oligodendrocyte differentiation we found that oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, present throughout the length of the nerve at postnatal day 2, mature into GC+ oligodendrocytes in a chiasm to eye progression. This gradient along the nerve of oligodendrocyte differentiation continues with oligodendrocytes near the chiasm expressing the genes and encoded proteins to MBP and PLP 3 d before oligodendrocytes near the eye. Although oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation occurs in a chiasm to eye gradient along the nerve, optic axon segments near the eye are ensheathed with myelin before segments near the chiasm. This suggests that the myelination of optic axons is initiated by a signaling step that is independent of oligodendrocyte differentiation and is stronger near the eye than the chiasm region of the nerve. By examining proposed axonal signals, we found that the onset of myelination is independent of the electrical activity of an axon but can be correlated to the size of an axon.",Immunology
7472510,"Persistent activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase by regulated proteolysis suggests a neuron-specific function of the ubiquitin system in Aplysia. In response to the facilitating neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT), the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) acquires a special mnemonic characteristic in Aplysia sensory neurons. PKA becomes persistently activated at basal cAMP concentrations owing to a decreased regulatory (R) to catalytic (C) subunit ratio. We previously implicated ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in this selective loss of R. Here we show that ubiquitin (Ub), Ub-conjugates and proteasomes are present in cell bodies, axon, neuropil and nerve terminals of Aplysia neurons. Because R subunits are not decreased in muscle exposed to 5-HT, comparison of the two tissues provides a tractable approach to determine how the Ub pathway is regulated. We compared the structure of M1, the muscle-specific R isoform, to that of N4, a major neuronal R isoform, to rule out the possibility that the differences in their stability result from differences in structure. We present evidence that N4 and M1 are encoded by identical transcripts; they also behave similarly as protein substrates for the Ub pathway in extracts of the two tissues. Nervous tissue contains 20-times more free Ub, but we present evidence that the susceptibility of R subunits to degradation in neurons relative to muscle results from the greater capacity of neurons to degrade ubiquitinated proteins through the proteasome. Thus, factors that regulate the activity of proteasomes could underlie the enhanced degradation of R subunits in long-term sensitization.",Immunology
7472471,"Presynaptic glutamate levels in tonic and phasic motor axons correlate with properties of synaptic release. Synaptic glutamate release involves the accumulation of cytoplasmic glutamate in synaptic vesicles, whereafter it is released by triggered exocytosis. As glutamatergic terminals are known to be functionally diverse it was of interest to examine whether the presynaptic glutamate supply differs between individual axon terminals with distinct release properties. The glutamatergic terminals in the crustacean neuromuscular system system comprise a ""phasic"" type which shows fatigue of release during repetitive stimulation, and a ""tonic"" type which can maintain transmission for long periods. Quantitative immunogold analysis showed that the axons in a tonic nerve innervating slow muscles in the abdomen contained two times higher levels of glutamate labeling over axoplasmic matrix and over mitochondria, as compared to the corresponding elements in a phasic nerve. Similar results were obtained when adjacent phasic and tonic axons in a mixed nerve innervating leg muscles were compared. In the terminal regions of tonic and phasic axons the glutamate labeling differed correspondingly over axoplasmic matrix and mitochondria, while the synaptic vesicles showed a similar strong accumulation of labeling in both types of terminal. The level of labeling for glutamine, a glutamate precursor, was closely similar in phasic and tonic axons. The axoplasmic glutamate concentration was estimated to be in the low millimolar range, through comparison with coprocessed conjugates with known glutamate concentration. These results show that fatigue-resistant tonic axons and terminals contain higher levels of glutamate than fatiguable phasic axons, presumably representing an adaptation to the markedly different impulse activities in the two types of neuron. The axonal glutamate concentrations are in the range of the Km value for vesicular glutamate transport. Thus in tonic axons the high glutamate level appears to promote an efficient refilling of synaptic vesicles during sustained release, while in phasic axons the refilling should be slower which is compatible with an infrequent release.",Immunology

Swimming is frequently recommended for cardiac rehabilitation, but little is known of its physiologic consequences in ischemic heart disease. Eight males who had had a myocardial infarction 8-17 months before the study were exercised to exhaustion or angina with 10 W/min-1 ramp on a cycle ergometer in sitting and supine positions. Oxygen uptake (VO2) was continuously measured to monitor the physiologic power requirement. All eight patients were taking beta blockers and four were taking digoxin. During sitting cycling, angina occurred in four and ST depression in five; during supine cycling, angina occurred in five and ST depression in six. VO2 was then measured while they swam at their own comfortable speed (mean 0.43 m/sec-1) in a swimming flume at water temperatures of 25.5 degrees C and 18 degrees C. In six, the water speed was gradually increased until they were limited by symptoms. Comfortable swimming at 25.5 degrees C was 87% (1.28 1/min-1) and at 18 degrees C 89% (1.30 1/min-1) of sitting peak VO2, while heart rates were 92% and 91% respectively. The mean peak VO2 and heart rate did not differ significantly between bicycle and swim tests (peak VO2 sitting 1.49 +/- 0.23, supine 1.42 +/- 0.24, 25.5 degrees C 1.60 +/- 0.17, 18 degrees C 1.52 +/- 0.19 1/min-1). Only two patients reported angina while swimming in warm water and one in cold water, although ST depression occurred in six in both swims. The subjective comfort and large muscle groups involved make swimming a good exercise, but the high relative energy cost and failure to identify ischemic symptoms indicate caution in cardiac patients, especially if their swimming skills are poor.",Immunology

Several studies have proven pleural bupivacaine effectively provides postthoracotomy analgesia for both children and adults. When 0.25% bupivacaine is administered as a continuous infusion or repeated bolus, serum bupivacaine levels frequently approach the toxic range. The hazards of bupivacaine toxicity are more difficult to monitor, especially in children who may not report symptoms of local anaesthetic toxicity. Because of this concern, we initiated the use of pleural lignocaine to provide postthoracotomy analgesia for paediatric patients. The records of all patients receiving pleural lignocaine from January 1991 to December 1992 were reviewed. A total of 98 pleural catheters were inserted in 96 patients ranging in age from five months to 20 years. Seven patients had lignocaine levels that exceeded 5 micrograms.ml-1 and no patient manifested symptoms of systemic toxicity. This study shows that the administration of pleural lignocaine is a safe method of providing postthoracotomy analgesia.

To specifically inhibit the proliferation of leukemic cells having the AML1/MTG8 fusion gene, we constructed two hammerhead ribozymes against AML1/MTG8.

In a cell-free system, Rz1 and Rz2 specifically cleaved AML1/MTG8 substrate, dependent on the concentration of ribozymes. When these ribozymes were transfected to Kasumi-1 cells, an AML cell line with AML1/MTG8, they were able to inhibit the cell growth.

The nonstructural 3 (NS3) protein, consisting of amino acids 1027-1657 of the polyprotein, is believed to be a multifunctional protein with an amino-terminal serine protease domain, which is involved in polyprotein processing, and a carboxy-terminal ATPase/RNA helicase domain, presumably involved in viral replication. We have assembled an expression vector which directs the synthesis of residues 1207-1612 of the polyprotein with an amino-terminal polyhistidine purification tag.

Clinical trials show that drug treatment significantly decreases stroke risk in hypertension. The benefit as measured in clinical trials may be affected by changes of blood pressure at entry and by departure from randomised treatment, but the magnitude of such effects is disputed. We have assessed benefit from reduction of stroke using data from the MRC Trial of mild to moderate hypertension, taking these factors into account, and have studied the likely effect of recent guidelines. The original analysis suggested that 850 patients needed treatment for 1 year to prevent one stroke. Under the more conservative of two assumptions made about the effect of treatment, this falls to 695 patients when allowance is made for reduction of stroke in placebo group patients withdrawn and actively treated, to 680 patients when allowance is made for the fall in blood pressure after entry, and to 556 patients with allowance for both. When benefit is assessed in patients whose entry diastolic blood pressure was > or = 100 mm Hg, 557 patients require treatment annually per stroke saved and this is decreased to 360 patients when allowance is made for withdrawal and active treatment of placebo group patients. These results suggest that benefit from reduction of stroke was underestimated in the MRC trial and that this is likely to be present in most trials.

In 14 animals (Group 3), a single hole was created and the dogs were allowed to triple their body weight before they were killed. Group 1 dogs demonstrated a 10% increase in average venae cavae--RA oxygen saturation immediately after septectomy and a 9.4 +/- 0.37 mm diameter of the ASD at death; in Group 2, there was a 14% average step-up and a 12.7 +/- 0.6 mm diameter of the ASD; and in Group 3, the diameter of the ASD was 11.5 +/- 0.4 mm, representing a 50% increase in average area with dog growth compared with that of Group 1. After this experience in the production of ASDs in 44 experimental animals, we find that this instrument seems to be reliable, simple, and safe.",Immunology

Their most conspicuous ultrastructural elements, a well developed tubular ER and a cisternal rER, as well as numerous active dictyosomes, indicate a high activity of protein synthesis and intracellular transport. Several dictyosomes show interassociations and partly direct interconnections with each other and with the tubular ER, the latter occurring at the fenestrated regions of the Golgi cisternae. These details, demonstrated by sections parallel and perpendicular to the cisternal planes of the dictyosomes, point to the existence of a functionally homogeneous endomembrane system.

A protein-synthesizing system in vitro, programmed with bacteriophage T7 DNA as template, changed the specificity of gene expression in the course of incubation as a result of newly synthesized T7 early proteins. The system mimics largely the situation in vivo on both the transcriptional and the translational levels, i.e. early gene expression is turned off shortly after late synthesis has been started. These results suggest that the switch from early to late expression does not necessarily require changes in the cellular environment nor is it dependent on the presence of membranes. The main part in this process is played by the phage-dependent RNA polymerase (gene 1 product), whose activity appears 8-10 min after start of incubation. When its activity is reduced by inhibitors or creation of non-optimal conditions, the system is not able to manage the early--late switch.",Immunology

Physiological arousal and orienting were measured in 101 unselected 15-year-old male schoolchildren. Of these, 17 antisocial adolescents who desisted from adult crime (desistors) were matched on adolescent antisocial behavior and demographic variables with 17 antisocial adolescents who became criminal by age 29 (criminals), and 17 nonantisocial, noncriminal normal subjects. Desistors had significantly higher electrodermal and cardiovascular arousal and higher electrodermal orienting than the criminal group. This is the first study to report biological factors that protect against the development of criminal behavior. The findings suggest that individuals predisposed to adult crime by virtue of showing antisocial behavior in adolescence may be protected from committing crime by high levels of autonomic arousal and orienting.",Immunology

Much of the research investigating the mechanisms of this increase in muscle has focused on mediators that are mitogenic for smooth muscle, while relatively few studies have focused on mediators inhibiting mitogenesis. In this study we have examined the effects of two mediators proposed as regulators of smooth muscle proliferation, namely heparin and prostaglandin (PG) E2, on human airway smooth muscle cells in culture stimulated with 1, 2.5, 5, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and platelet-derived growth factor AB (PDGF), 50 ng/ml. PGE2 had a biphasic effect on DNA synthesis in the presence of 1% FBS, with 10(-6) M causing inhibition and 10(-7) M causing an increase in DNA synthesis. PGE2 caused inhibition of DNA synthesis in the presence of 2.5, 5, and 10% FBS. Heparin (10 and 100 U/ml) caused an inhibition of DNA synthesis induced by 1% FBS, while 100 U/ml inhibited DNA synthesis induced by 5 and 10% FBS. PGE2 (10(-8), 10(-7), and 10(-6) M) inhibited the DNA synthesis induced by PDGF, while heparin (1, 10, and 100 U/ml) had no effect.

Our purpose was to evaluate the relationship between fetal cardiac wall hypertrophy and ventricular function in fetuses of metabolically controlled, insulin-requiring diabetics. M-mode directed fetal echocardiography included measurements of left and right ventricular free wall and interventricular septal thickness and ventricular diastolic and systolic dimensions. Fetal measurements included biparietal diameter, estimation of fetal weight, and cardiac area/thoracic area. Cardiac size is expressed as a ratio of wall thickness/biparietal diameter, and function is expressed as ventricular shortening fraction (Ventricular diastolic dimension-Ventricular systolic dimension/Ventricular diastolic dimension). Fetuses of diabetics at 20 to 24, 28 to 31, and 32 to 36 weeks' gestation were compared with normal fetuses of nondiabetic mothers at similar gestational ages, which were used as a control group. Study and control groups were comparable in mean gestational age (22 vs 20, 29 vs 29, 35 vs 34 weeks) in each of groups 1, 2, and 3. All fetuses tested fell within these groups. Estimated fetal weight, cardiac area/thoracic area, right ventricular wall thickness/biparietal diameter, and interventricular septal thickness/biparietal diameter were greater in the study group between 32 and 36 weeks: 3227 +/- 430 versus 2235 +/- 176 gm (p < 0.05), 0.32 versus 0.29, (p < 0.05), 0.53 +/- 0.05 versus 0.44 +/- 0.05 mm (p < 0.05), and 0.50 +/- 0.3 versus 0.46 +/- 0.5 mm (p < 0.05), respectively. Right ventricular shortening fraction/left ventricular shortening fraction was significantly different from controls in this group (1.30 vs 0.89, p < 0.05). This change was a function of altered right ventricular shortening fraction in late diabetic pregnancy. Right ventricular shortening fraction in the study groups was 0.39, 0.36, and 0.52, respectively, versus 0.36, 0.41, and 0.33 in controls. Left ventricular shortening fraction in the group at 32 to 36 weeks and in controls in three groups was 0.42, 0.39, 0.40 and 0.44, 0.37. These findings reveal an increase in right ventricular shortening fraction associated with global cardiac enlargement.

Casodex, a non-steroidal antiandrogen, is a racemic mixture of R-Casodex, the pharmacologically active (-)-enantiomer, and S-Casodex, the inactive (+)-enantiomer. Single oral doses of pseudo-racemic 14C-Casodex (10 mg/kg), prepared from mixtures of either 14C-labelled R-Casodex and unlabelled S-Casodex, or 14C-S-Casodex and unlabelled R-Casodex, were administered to the intact and bile duct-cannulated male rat. 2. Neither enantiomer underwent stereochemical inversion, but the pharmacokinetics of Casodex showed marked enantioselectivity. 3. After dosing R-labelled Casodex, plasma concentrations of R-Casodex increased slowly to reach a peak of 3.50 +/- 0.05 micrograms/ml (mean +/- SEM) at 12 h and, thereafter, declined monoexponentially with an elimination half-life of 24 h. Plasma concentrations of S-Casodex rose rapidly to reach a much lower peak of 0.97 +/- 0.06 microgram/ml at 3 h and, thereafter, declined rapidly, although there were insufficient data to determine the half-life. R-Casodex had a much higher AUC0-24 (66 micrograms.h/ml) than S-Casodex (12 micrograms.h/ml). Plasma drug concentrations measured using an achiral assay were in very good agreement with the sum of the enantiomer concentrations throughout the profile. R-Casodex comprised 94% of the total plasma radioactivity at 12 h, decreasing to 75% at 120 h. 4. Plasma concentration data generated after administration of S-Casodex were similar to those observed after dosing R-labelled Casodex. S-Casodex comprised about 74% of the total plasma radioactivity at 6 h and only 41% at 24 h. 5. The urine of intact animals contained 36 +/- 2 and 48 +/- 3% of the dose respectively up to 48 and 120 h after dosing with R-labelled Casodex, and 33 +/- 4 and 34 +/- 4% respectively after dosing with S-labelled Casodex. The urine and bile of the cannulated rat contained 43 +/- 2 and 21 +/- 2% of the dose respectively up to 48 h after dosing with R-labelled Casodex and 37 (n = 2) and 50% respectively after dosing with S-labelled Casodex. 6. After dosing with R- or S-labelled Casodex, the urinary radioactivity consisted of the carboxylic acid metabolite formed by hydrolytic cleavage at the amide, whereas biliary radioactivity consisted of hydroxy-Casodex and Casodex, mainly conjugated with glucuronic acid. The clearance of R-Casodex by each of these pathways of metabolism was less than that of S-Casodex, with direct glucuronidation and hydroxylation showing greater enantioselectivity than hydrolysis.",Immunology

Specific serological screening tests for Trypanosoma-cruzi-infected donors are not yet available and thus not routinely performed in North America. With the recent increase of Latin-American immigration to North America and Europe, there is a risk of transmission by blood products. In this study, we evaluated the possibility whether any of the serological screening tests currently recommended by the AABB could be used as a surrogate marker for this protozoarium. A group of 26,365 blood donors (male = 21,053 and female = 5,312) was analysed for the correlation of T. cruzi antibodies (TcAb) with other serological markers (HIV, HBsAg, ALT, HTLV-I/II, HCV, Anti-HBc, syphilis and unexpected hemoglobins other than A1, A2 and F). Association could be demonstrated only between syphilis and TcAb in the female group (p = 0.005), but the low number of donors found with this association (n = 4) renders the effect of this correlation very small. A higher prevalence of TcAb was found in older age groups, with even gender distribution (p < 0.05), however, donors aged more than 54 years also represent a minority of the donor pool (4.83%) and the detection of positive donors in this age group also has a minor preventive effect on transfusion-transmitted Chagas disease. We conclude that when infected blood donors must be detected, specific serological screening for TcAb is essential and that currently no surrogate marker can be considered for detecting T. cruzi-infected blood donors.",Immunology

Myositis ossificans traumatica (MOT) is a nonneoplastic, heterotopic ossification of soft tissues i.e. skeletal muscle, tendons, aponeuroses and fascia. It is often encountered in young male athletes participating in contact sports as a result of a single or repeated contusion. MOT tends to be solitary, localized and well circumscribed with a self-limited growth potential that may culminate in regression. The pathogenesis of MOT is still enigmatic. Recent animal experiments have led to a theory that mesenchymal connective tissue cells, undergo metaplasia induced by trauma and probably osteogenic proteins, to fibroblasts and osteoblasts. These cells deposit and structure osteoid centripetally in the lesion. As the lesion matures, cancellous bone develops into mature, lamellar bone in the periphery of the lesion. In its earlier stages MOT is easily cytologically and radiologically confused with osteogenic sarcoma. The management of MOT is largely conservative and the principles are of considerable value to physicians and physiotherapists engaged in the treatment of sports injuries.

They were first used in treating hypertension, but nowadays cardiac diseases, mainly cardiac failure, are common indications. This means that the drugs are used in the treatment of more elderly patients who often have generalised atherosclerosis. This means that the patients must be controlled more often after initiation of treatment, especially concerning kidney function, since treatment with ACE-inhibitors can cause pronounced changes in renal haemodynamics and kidney function. This review focuses on the effects of ACE-inhibitors on renal haemodynamics and kidney function, which may be positive, with preservation of kidney function in diabetic and other chronic nephropathy, or negative, for example in cases with atherosclerotic stenosis of large or small renal arteries. It is concluded, that in cases of diabetic nephropathy an ACE-inhibitor is the ""drug of choice"" for treatment of hypertension. Furthermore the ACE-inhibitors seem to reduce the rate of deterioration of renal function and proteinuria in other kidney diseases. It is emphasized, that during treatment with ACE-inhibitors kidney function must be controlled before and following one to two weeks of treatment, if the dose is changed and in all cases following two to three months of treatment.

Hirudin, a specific and high affinity inhibitor of the active site of thrombin, together with antibody to hirudin were applied to sections of AMeX-fixed specimens of normal lung, kidney, placenta, freshly incised skin and unperturbed skin obtained at fresh autopsy; to rheumatoid synovial tissue; and to malignant tissue from a variety of tumor types. Staining for thrombin was observed selectively on pulmonary alveolar, rheumatoid synovial, and placental macrophages that express an intact extrinsic coagulation pathway. Staining was also observed restricted to the endothelium of capillaries in freshly incised skin but not in either unperturbed skin or in aged incisions. Staining of tumor cell bodies was observed in small cell carcinoma of the lung, renal cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma tissues that we found previously to show tumor cell-associated procoagulant activity. This staining occurred commonly on cells within the tumor mass that were distant from stromal fibrinogen/fibrin. By contrast, tumor-associated macrophage but not tumor cell staining was seen in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, and little or no staining was seen colon cancer tissue. Negative controls in which either the hirudin probe or its antibody were omitted failed to show staining. These results are in accord with previous findings and suggest that such techniques may be useful for studying the cellular sites of thrombin generation in intact tissues. We postulate that administration of potent and specific thrombin antagonists, such as hirudin, to patients with relevant tumor types might be followed by homing of hirudin to tumor cells in vivo so that effects of local thrombin generation on malignant progression can be determined.",Immunology

To determine the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis urogenital infection and to identify behavioral, demographic, and clinical factors associated with the infection in pregnant women in Martinique. One-thousand-four-hundred-eleven patients 15-39 years old, at 10-16 weeks of gestation and attending the prenatal clinic at Lamentin Hospital, were tested for Chlamydia trachomatis infection of the cervix and urethra using tissue culture. Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated from 375 (26.7%) women; 34% of them were positive in the cervix and urethra, 58% in the cervix only, and 8% in the urethra only. Factors found by multivariate analysis to be significantly associated with chlamydial infection were age less than 25 years, first intercourse at less than 18 years old, previous induced abortions, mucopurulent cervicitis, and repeated candidiasis. None of the factors associated with chlamydial infection was sensitive enough to permit efficient selective screening. It is cost effective to recommend a routine screening for chlamydial infection together with an educational program.",Immunology

7481746,"Biochemical biomarkers in ecotoxicology--some recent developments. Biochemical biomarkers measure the exposure of organisms to environmental chemicals. They can also provide measures of toxic effect, e.g. where they are based on molecular mechanisms which underly toxicity. Ideally, biomarkers should be sensitive, specific, simple to use and suitable for the assay of material obtained by non-destructive sampling procedures (e.g. of blood). Recently, there has been encouraging progress in the development of several different types of biomarker assays: (1) The measurement of inhibition of serum 'B' esterases to monitor exposure of birds to organophosphorus insecticides. (2) The measurement of DNA damage caused by aromatic hydrocarbons. DNA adduct formation has been studied using the 32P-postlabelling technique. Several other techniques are currently under investigation. (3) The measurement of disturbances to the transthyretin-retinol binding protein complex caused by a metabolite of 3,4,3',4',tetrachlorobiphenyl. (4) The measurement of precursors of clotting proteins in blood following the inhibition of the Vitamin K cycle by anticoagulant rodenticides. Of these examples, the first is only a biomarker of exposure but the remaining three examples are, in principle, biomarkers of toxic effect since they all represent measures of molecular mechanisms which underly toxicity. Biochemical biomarkers have considerable potential for measuring effects of chemicals under field conditions--especially where carefully selected combinations of them are used.",Immunology

They could therefore facilitate the transport of a protease inhibitor to ischemic areas of tissue injury and be of additional benefit. To compare the effects of dextrans with and without aprotinin, necrotizing pancreatitis was induced in 33 male dextran-resistant Wistar rats by intraductal infusion of low-dose glycodeoxycholic acid (10 mmol/l) followed by intravenous cerulein (5 micrograms/kg/h) for 6 h. Three and four hours after the start of the cerulein infusion the animals received infusions of either Ringer's lactate (RL) (12 ml/kg), 70,000 Da dextran (10%) (DEX-70) (4 ml/kg) alone, or DEX-70 (4 ml/kg) with aprotinin (5000 IU/kg) (DEX-70/A). The death rate was 60% within 9 h in the RL group (6 of 10) but only 10% in the DEX-70 group (1 of 10) (p < 0.03; Fisher's exact test) and 23% in the DEX-70/A group (3 of 13). Histomorphometry demonstrated a significant reduction of acinar necrosis in both treatment groups compared with control animals (p < 0.014; t test). Total amounts of trypsinogen activation peptides (TAP) in ascites were also significantly lower in these groups (p < 0.05; t test). DEX-70 given 3 h and 4 h after induction of pancreatitis significantly reduced the levels of TAP, limited acinar necrosis, and improved survival rate in acute necrotizing rodent pancreatitis. There was no additional benefit from the combination with aprotinin.",Immunology
7481209,"A quality-adjusted survival meta-analysis of adjuvant chemotherapy for premenopausal breast cancer. International Breast Cancer Study Group. The purpose of this paper is to develop and apply a meta-analysis methodology, that does not require patient-level data, for comparing treatments in terms of quality-of-life-adjusted survival. As a motivating example, we considered adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. This therapy has been shown to offer an improvement in recurrence-free and overall survival, especially for younger women, but its acute toxic effects discourage some physicians from prescribing it. To determine whether the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy treatment outweighs its costs in terms of toxic effects, we performed a meta-analysis of quality-adjusted survival based on data from 1229 patients, 49 years of age or younger, randomized in eight clinical trials that compared chemotherapy versus no adjuvant systemic therapy. We conducted the meta-analysis by performing a quality-adjusted survival analysis known as a Q-TWiST analysis on each trial. A Q-TWiST analysis allows one to make treatment comparisons that incorporate differences in quality of life associated with various health states. In this analysis, we define as health states the periods of time patients spend: (i) with subjective toxic effects of chemotherapy; (ii) without symptoms of recurrence and toxicity, and (iii) following disease recurrence. We assigned weights to each health state which reflect their relative value in terms of quality of life and allowed them to vary in a sensitivity analysis. We then combined the individual trial results in a meta-analysis, using a multivariate regression model, in such a way that we could easily perform an overall sensitivity analysis. Individual patient-level data are not required to perform this meta-analysis methodology if the individual Q-TWiST analysis results for each trial are available.",Immunology

Tissue response to insults is similar regardless of the tissue involved, and occurs in two sequential and interconnected steps, inflammation and fibroproliferation. Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a disease characterized by acute onset of diffuse and severe inflammatory reaction of the lung parenchyma with loss of compartmentalization, resulting in protein rich exudative edema. Following tissue injury, a complex pattern of responses begins to repair the lung. Ineffective repair is evident histologically with extensive pulmonary fibroproliferation and clinically with fever (without a source of infection) and inability to improve lung function. We will review recent observations indicating that an exaggerated pulmonary inflammatory response plays a key role in the progression of ARDS. We will provide a unifying pathogenetic model of ARDS, showing how the evolution from acute to chronic inflammation explains the progression of histological, laboratory, clinical, and physiological findings seen during the course of unresolving ARDS.",Immunology

Fourteen patients received either pre-operative (8) or post-operative (6) external beam radiation therapy. Primary gliomas: 18-months actuarial survival rate has been 56% (range: 1-21+ months) and the median survival time has not yet been achieved. Four patients developed tumor progression (median time to tumor progression: 9 months). Recurrent gliomas: 18-months actuarial survival rate and median survival time has been 47% and 13 months (range: 6-32+ months) respectively. The median time to tumor progression was 11 months.

Neuregulin (also called NDF, heregulin, GGF and ARIA) is a member of the EGF family which induces growth and differentiation of epithelial, glial and muscle cells in culture. The biological effects of the factor are mediated by tyrosine kinase receptors. Neuregulin can bind directly to erbB3 and erbB4 and receptor heterodimerization allows neuregulin-dependent activation of erbB2 (refs 1, 2, 5). A targeted mutation in mice reveals multiple essential roles of neuregulin in development. Here we show that neuregulin -/- embryos die during embryogenesis and display heart malformations. In addition, Schwann cell precursors and cranial ganglia fail to develop normally. The phenotype demonstrates that in vivo neuregulin acts locally and frequently in a paracrine manner. All cell types affected by the mutation express either erbB3 or erbB4, indicating that either of these tyrosine kinase receptors can be a component in recognition and transmission of essential neuregulin signals.",Immunology
7475190,"Influence of vein valves in the development of arteriosclerosis in venoarterial grafts in the rabbit. Coronary saphenous vein grafts in human beings have a more limited long-term patency rate than internal thoracic artery grafts, primarily because of more rapid development of arteriosclerosis. The factors responsible for this increased susceptibility are not completely understood. To test the hypothesis that vein valves may influence this process, we studied 48 hypercholesterolemic rabbits with jugular vein grafts interposed into the carotid arterial circulation. In 24 animals (group A), the vein segments did not contain a vein valve. In the other 24 animals (group B), a vein valve was present. Both groups were further divided in four subgroups of six to be put to death at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after the operation. All animals were fed a 2% cholesterol diet. At postmortem examination, alternate 2 mm sections were either stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histologic and morphometric studies or frozen in liquid nitrogen for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization studies. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunostaining was used to study cell proliferation. Wall thickness of vein grafts increased with time. During the first 2 weeks intimal and medial thickening was primarily due to an increase in numbers of cells. Between 2 and 6 weeks further intimal and medial thickening occurred, but without additional increase in cell numbers. After 6 weeks, foam cells and lipid deposits started to appear. By 8 weeks, changes identical to those seen in arteriosclerotic plaques in human beings were evident. These changes developed sooner and with more intensity in group B animals (p < 0.01 to 0.001), and they developed faster and with more severity in segments of vein located distal to the valve than in the segments located proximal to the valve (p < 0.001). This is the first controlled experiment demonstrating that the presence of valves in the vein segments is associated with augmented and accelerated intimal changes leading to vein atheromatosis.",Immunology

However, a thorough understanding of the development of these natural antixenodonor xenoantibodies remains incomplete. In this study, serum samples were obtained from newborn, infant, and adult human beings. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the binding of human natural immunoglobulin M xenoantibodies to pig aortic endothelial cells and pig lymphocytes. A complement-mediated cytotoxicity assay was used to measure the cytotoxicity of newborn, infant, and adult serum to cultured pig aortic endothelial cells and pig lymphocytes. Adult human serum contained both natural immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G xenoantibodies to pig endothelial cells and lymphocytes, whereas newborn infant serum contained only immunoglobulin G xenoantibodies. Only adult human serum was cytotoxic to pig endothelial cells and lymphocytes. Human immunoglobulin M xenoantibodies became detectable by age 1 month. By age 2 months these natural anti-pig xenoantibodies reached serum levels equivalent to those in the human adult and resulted in similar cytotoxicity to that of adult human serum. These findings indicate that (1) natural anti-pig immunoglobulin M xenoantibodies are absent from newborn infant human serum, (2) newborn human serum is not cytotoxic to pig endothelial cells and lymphocytes despite the presence of immunoglobulin G xenoantibodies that bind to pig endothelial cells and lymphocytes, and (3) natural anti-pig immunoglobulin M xenoantibodies begin to develop as early as age 1 month and by age 2 months attain a circulating level comparable to that found in the adult.",Immunology

7475110,"Evolutionary cycling in predator-prey interactions: population dynamics and the red queen. This paper describes the coevolution of phenotypes in a community comprising a population of predators and of prey. It is shown that evolutionary cycling is a likely outcome of the process. The dynamical systems on which this description is based are constructed from microscopic stochastic birth and death events, together with a process of random mutation. Births and deaths are caused in part by phenotype-dependent interactions between predator and prey individuals and therefore generate natural selection. Three outcomes of evolution are demonstrated. A community may evolve to a state at which the predator becomes extinct, or to one at which the species coexist with constant phenotypic values, or the species may coexist with cyclic changes in phenotypic values. The last outcome corresponds to a Red Queen dynamic, in which the selection pressures arising from the predator-prey interaction cause the species to evolve without ever reaching an equilibrium phenotypic state. The Red Queen dynamic requires an intermediate harvesting efficiency of the prey by the predator and sufficiently high evolutionary rate constant of the prey, and is robust when the model is made stochastic and phenotypically polymorphic. A cyclic outcome lies outside the contemporary focus on evolutionary equilibria, and argues for an extension to a dynamical framework for describing the asymptotic states of evolution.",Immunology
7475030,"Role of alcohol in traffic crashes involving women: passenger car fatalities in northern Sweden. Since increased alcohol consumption and increased driving among women may lead to a growing mortality due to drunken driving among women, the study analyzed gender differences among traffic fatalities. Traffic fatalities (597 victims, 159 women) in northern Sweden were investigated, using autopsy and police reports, for a 10-year period, 1980-1989. The incidence of inebriated female driver fatalities was 0.51 per 100 million km (men, 0.66). Eighty-six percent of the female inebriated drivers (98% of men) and 68% of female sober drivers (78% of men) initiated the crash. Blood alcohol was detected in 10% of the women (men, 32%) with a mean blood alcohol concentration of 1.1 g/kg (men, 1.9 g/kg). Of the women, 13% had liver steatosis (men, 28%). The proportion of victims with liver steatosis increased with increasing blood alcohol concentration. Only one case of liver cirrhosis was found (a man). The majority of the inebriated victims were killed from May through October (women, 73%; men, 76%), and from Fridays through Sundays (women, 87%; men, 70%). Only 27% of the inebriated women crashed between 9 PM and 6 AM, compared to 62% of the men. The body location of fatal trauma was similar in men and women and was not influenced by alcohol. Female traffic fatalities differ from those of men in several respects. No evidence was found for an increase in the number of women in alcohol-related traffic fatalities in Sweden over the 10-year period studied. Drunken driving and alcohol abuse in traffic is still mainly a male problem.",Immunology
7474152,"Peptide vaccine against canine parvovirus: identification of two neutralization subsites in the N terminus of VP2 and optimization of the amino acid sequence. The N-terminal domain of the major capsid protein VP2 of canine parvovirus was shown to be an excellent target for development of a synthetic peptide vaccine, but detailed information about number of epitopes, optimal length, sequence choice, and site of coupling to the carrier protein was lacking. Therefore, several overlapping peptides based on this N terminus were synthesized to establish conditions for optimal and reproducible induction of neutralizing antibodies in rabbits. The specificity and neutralizing ability of the antibody response for these peptides were determined. Within the N-terminal 23 residues of VP2, two subsites able to induce neutralizing antibodies and which overlapped by only two glycine residues at positions 10 and 11 could be discriminated. The shortest sequence sufficient for neutralization induction was nine residues. Peptides longer than 13 residues consistently induced neutralization, provided that their N termini were located between positions 1 and 11 of VP2. The orientation of the peptides at the carrier protein was also of importance, being more effective when coupled through the N terminus than through the C terminus to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The results suggest that the presence of amino acid residues 2 to 21 (and probably 3 to 17) of VP2 in a single peptide is preferable for a synthetic peptide vaccine.",Immunology
7474003,"Release of anti-inflammatory mediators after mechanical trauma correlates with severity of injury and clinical outcome. Excessive synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1 beta] after trauma has been correlated with poor outcome. Recently, naturally occurring inhibitors of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta have been characterized such as soluble TNF receptors (sTNFRs) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). The present study was undertaken to determine whether injury results in a rise of circulating sTNFRs and IL-1ra. If so, whether plasma levels of these anti-inflammatory mediators correlate with severity of injury and clinical outcome of these patients. Injured patients (n = 213) showed significantly increased sTNFR and IL-1ra plasma levels throughout the observation period of 14 days, compared with healthy volunteers (n = 127). Patients with severe injury (Injury Severity Score > 16 points) revealed higher levels (p < 0.05) of sTNFRs and IL-1ra than patients with minor trauma (Injury Severity Score < or = 16 points). Patients who died from injury demonstrated increased (p < 0.05) sTNFR p55 and IL-1ra plasma levels, compared with survivors. Thus, anti-inflammatory mechanisms are activated after trauma dependent on severity of injury. Because increased plasma levels of anti-inflammatory reacting proteins portended poorly for patient survival, these mediators may contribute to prediction of outcome after severe injury.",Immunology

A further case-referent study of soft-tissue sarcomas has now been performed to confirm these earlier findings and also to obtain further information on the effects of different phenoxy acids.

The first recording was at a mean time of six hours after the onset of pain; subsequent records were taken every eight hours for 24 hours, every 12 hours for the second day, and every day thereafter. Serial CK MB estimates were obtained at every four hours for the first 72 hours. There was good agreement in the time course between the electrocardiogram and enzyme evolution. Forty-one per cent of patients showed rapid infarction with R wave and Q wave evolution complete within 12 hours of pain and accompanied by a short duration of enzyme release (mean = 19.30 hours). Fifty-nine per cent of patients showed more prolonged infarction with longer R wave and Q wave evolution and enzyme release (mean = 30 hours). Four patients also showed delayed reinfarction. ST segment elevation was maximal at six hours in the whole group and was significantly lower thereafter. Patients with rapid infarction showed high initial ST segment elevation which decreased promptly compared with those with prolonged infarction, who showed moderate but more persistent  ST segment elevation.

Eleven young adult male subjects were each recorded for three sessions of masturbation to orgasm. Electrical signals from an anal pressure probe were automatically digitized by computer. Orgasmic contractions were easily distinguished from voluntary contractions by the steadily increasing intervals and complete muscle relaxation between orgasmic contractions. At orgasm each subject produced a characteristic series of contractions starting abruptly at an intercontraction interval of about 0.6 seconds, and continued for 10 to 15 contractions at an increasing increment of about 0.1 second per contraction. Pressure amplitude, representing the force of contractions, increased from the beginning of the regular series to a maximum at the seventh or eighth contraction. Area under the pressure curve, reflecting muscular exertion during contraction, generally increased throughout the regular series. Each man's pattern of contractions was very similar from one session to the next and distinguished his records from others'. Individuals' patterns could be grouped into three types, based chiefly on the location of the regular contraction series within the subjective span of orgasm. The most common type was a simple series of regular contractions. It had the shortest duration and fewest contractions. The next most common pattern began with the regular series, followed by a number of irregular contractions. This type was longest in duration.

In the diabetic group the three erection parameters were very depressed. In the group with primary psychogenic erectile impotence all five parameters were lower than in the controls, with the greatest difference in spontaneous fluctuations in skin resistance. The psychophysiological profile of the group of patients with secondary psychogenic erectile impotence was surprisingly similar to the profile of the diabetics, with a sharp increase in systolic blood pressure and in spontaneous fluctuations in skin resistance, but very depressed erection parameters. There were no marked differences between the controls and the premature ejaculators. There were only a few correlations between self-rated sexual arousal and psychophysiological measures of sexual stimulation and these were not very high.

Following a 15-day interval, treatment was resumed with lysine clofibrate, at the same dosage, for 2 subsequent months. At the end of both treatments, it was recorded a clear-cout reduction in the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, total lipids and lipoproteins. When comparing the effectiveness of the two treatments, we notice that the activity of the two products is identical, though the effects of lysine clofibrate was more precociously evident than that of clofibrate. The results obtained are particularly interesting: equal doses of the drugs were administered, yet the clofibric acid contained in lysine clofibrate is much less than that cointained in clofibrate.

Methods and parameters are described to quantify body sway as measured by a force-transducing platform. Analogue data representing the coordinates of the body's center of force (COF) are fed into a digital computer. Th following parameters are then calculated and tested for their diagnostic significance: sway path (SP), mean amplitude of sway (MA), mean sway frequency (MF), their lateral and sagittal components, and the quotients sagittal/lateral of these as well as the sway area (SA) circumscribed by the COF. Quotients of eyes open/eyes closed for all these parameters determine the visual stabilization of posture. Sway position and sway direction histograms allow for a more detailed analysis of MA and SP. Despite considerable inter- and intraindividual variance of these parameters (in 28 normals), some of them seem of clinical significance not only for documentation and follow-up studies but also for differential diagnosis. In patients with cerebellar lesions (n = 12), SP and MA were up to 10 times larger with a marked antero-posterior instability, MF being above normal. Patients with labyrinthine lesions (n = 10) showed significant instability only with eyes closed, MF being slightly below normal.",Immunology

The purpose of this study was to determine the isometric twitch tension (Pt), isometric tetanic tension (Po), and twitch contraction time (Ct) of the reinnervating rat soleus and plantaris muscles. Six groups of adult female Wistar rats (200 to 225 gm BW) underwent bilateral sciatic nerve crush at the sciatic notch, while another 6 groups were kept as sham-operated normal controls. The contractile properties of the muscles from the normal and crush-denervated groups (n=6-9) were determined in vitro weekly, at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks, post-nerve crush. The muscle were equilibrated in a polyglass cell in oxygenated Ringer's solution at pH 7.2 at 34-35 C. The muscles were field stimulated at optimal length (Lo) to produce maximal Pt, using 15-20 v, 5 amp current, at 0.2 Hz for 1 msec duration. Following twitch determinations, the muscles were tetanized at 200 Hz. All tension values were expressed per unit area of the muscle. The respective control tension per area values for the soleus and plantaris were: Pt, 3.3 +/- 0.4 gm, 5.9 +/- 0.4 gm; Po, 20.7 +/- 5.1 gm, 21.8 +/- 4.8 gm, while the Ct values for the soleus and plantaris were 37.6 +/- 2.1 msec and 16.3 +/- 1.1 msec, respectively. At 3 weeks post-nerve crush, the crush-denervated soleus Pt and Ct increased 40% and 33.6% respectively, and the plantaris 28.2% at 1 week after the nerve was crushed. Gradual recovery was noted in the Pt and Ct from the 4th to 6th weeks post-crush, while the Po began improving 1 to 2 weeks after denervation. The soleus Pt and Po appeared to be more dependent on neural control than the plantaris muscle. During reinnervation, the slow soleus and fast plantaris Ct were equally dependent on innervation. Reinnervation prompted changes in the Po, Pt, and Ct, suggesting that regenerating neurons promote a sequential emergence of normal contractility.",Immunology

Dermatomyositis, an inflammatory disease of unknown etiology, causes diffuse symmetrical weakness and atrophy, muscular pain and tenderness, induration of muscles, and the tendency to develop contractures. The disease may follow a prolonged course which can best be managed with steroids and regulation of physical activity if there is an objective criterion for determining the extent of clinical involvement. In 6 children with dermatomyositis, quantitative muscular strength was compared with clinical evaluation of the state of the disease, serum enzyme levels, and other laboratory measures of systemic inflammation. Quantitative evaluation of ankle plantar flexor strength by the method of Beasley or handgrip force by the method of Mundale indicated that muscular strength provided a better criterion for the clinical status of the patient than any of the other laboratory tests studied. In dermatomyositis, the inflammation is equally great in distal and proximal muscles when tested quantitatively.

Cylindrical specimens were obtained from the head and condyles of pairs of cadaveric femora and subjected to axial loading. The data were evaluated statistically. The medianL values for relaxation of cancellous bone were greater in the femoral head than in the condyles, greater proximally than distally and greater medially than laterally in the condyles. The distribution of creep was found to be the reverse. The correlation analysis showed that a linear correlation between compressive strength, apparent density and the time dependent properties cannot be assumed.

The patients are premedicated with Thalamonal and atropine. For induction is given: thiopental (Pentothal) 4 mg/kg and pancuronium (Pavulon) 0.1 mg/kg. Subsequently fentanyl 7 micrograms/kg and dehydrobenzperidol 0.25 micrograms/kg is given intravenously. The patient is moderately hyperventilated (PaCO2 30-35 mm Hg) with an O2/N2O gasmixture. Through a second intravenous infusion fentanyl (20 ml fentanyl dissolved in 500 ml glucose 10%) is given continuously to obtain a good painrelief during the whole procedure. Those conditions eliminate almost each cause of an increase of the blood pressure. Once the dura meter is opened, halothane is administered in a concentration between 0.5% and 3% to lower the mean arterial pressure to 60 mm Hg. Within 15 minutes the blood pressure is on the desired level. After clipping off the aneurysm, halothane is stopped and the blood pressure regains its normal level. Postoperatively the patient is ventilated during 24 hours (moderate hyperventilation). To prevent an increase of the blood pressure, the administration of the fentanyl solution is continued. Indeed, the blood pressure may not be allowed to increase because the autoregulation of the CBF is markedly disturbed after a hypotension. This technique has been used in 7 patients.",Immunology

The carefully selected test strains include 20 species of bacteria and 2 species of yeasts which represent obligatory aerobic, facultative anaerobic and obligatory anaerobic microorganisms with quite different nutritional and atmospherical requirements. The 9 tested media are good enough for the purpose of culturing nonfastidious bacteria. However, most of the commercially prepared media failed to detect small inocula of very fastidious microbial agents, especially when no blood is added.

Serum ferritin concentrations have been measured in 124 patients with homozygous beta thalassaemia who were between 2 and 21 years old, had received 11--504 units of blood but had not undergone splenectomy. There were highly significant correlations between serum ferritin concentration and both the amount of blood transfused and alanine amino-transferase (ALT) activity. However, multivariate analysis showed that units of blood and ALT activity together only accounted for about 30% of the variation in serum ferritin concentration. Little of the remaining variation could be explained by other variables related to iron metabolism or liver damage. The concentration of concanavalin A binding ferritin increased rapidly with the number of units of blood up to 100 units but thereafter showed no further increase with number of transfusions. The concentration of non-binding ferritin was more closely related to transfusion load. These results suggest that the secretion of glycosylated ferritin from reticuloendothelial cells reaches a maximum with increasing iron accumulation, perhaps reflecting a maximum rate of synthesis. Ferritinaemia in patients with transfusional iron overload therefore seems to be the result of the combined effects of increased ferritin synthesis and the release of intracellular ferritin from damaged cells. A simple relationship between serum ferritin and iron stores cannot be assumed when ferritin concentrations exceed 4000 microgram/l or in patients who have received more than 100 units of transfused blood.",Immunology

The primary source of evidence that inorganic arsenic in drinking water is associated with increased mortality from cancer at internal sites (bladder, liver, lung, and other organs) is a large ecologic study conducted in regions of Southwest Taiwan endemic to Blackfoot disease. The dose-response patterns for lung, liver, and bladder cancers display a nonlinear dose-response relationship with arsenic exposure. The data do not appear suitable, however, for the more refined task of dose-response assessment, particularly for inference of risk at the low arsenic concentrations found in some U.S. water supplies. The problem lies in variable arsenic concentrations between the wells within a village, largely due to a mix of shallow wells and deep artesian wells, and in having only one well test for 24 (40%) of the 60 villages. The current analysis identifies 14 villages where the exposure appears most questionable, based on criteria described in the text. The exposure values were then changed for seven of the villages, from the median well test being used as a default to some other point in the village's range of well tests that would contribute to smoothing the appearance of a dose-response curve. The remaining seven villages, six of which had only one well test, were deleted as outliers. The resultant dose-response patterns showed no evidence of excess risk below arsenic concentrations of 0.1 mg/l. Of course, that outcome is dependent on manipulation of the data, as described. Inclusion of the seven deleted villages would make estimates of risk much higher at low doses. In those seven villages, the cancer mortality rates are significantly high for their exposure levels, suggesting that their exposure values may be too low or that other etiological factors need to be taken into account.",Immunology

7480641,"One hundred years of X rays in biological research. The history of X rays in biological research began almost simultaneously with Roentgen's discovery of his new rays. The history may be unique because of the remarkable collaboration of physicists, chemists, biologists and clinicians--collaborations which have produced and are continuing to produce major contributions to both biological and medical science. These contributions include the use of X rays to investigate molecular structure and function, the first demonstration of induced mutagenesis, the delineation of the cell cycle, the initiation of in vitro and in vivo cloning of mammalian cells, and original studies in DNA repair. The following is a personal overview of the history of some of these developments and their relationship to areas of current biological research. In each case an attempt has been made to trace developments from an early observation or observations to the current day. The history has been divided into two segments, each of approximately 50 years. This division seems appropriate because the separation occurs at approximately the same time as developments which were to play a major role in determining the future of radiation research.",Immunology

Histones of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were prepared by a new method and fractionated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Acid-urea-Triton gel analysis and tritiated acetate labeling demonstrated high levels of steady-state acetylation for the single histone H3 protein, in contrast to low levels on histones H4 and H2B. Twenty percent of histone H3 is subject to dynamic acetylation with, on average, three acetylated lysine residues per protein molecule. Histone synthesis in light-dark-synchronized cultures was biphasic with pattern differences between two histone H1 variants, between two H2A variants, and between H2B and ubiquitinated H2B. Automated protein sequence analysis of histone H3 demonstrated a site-specific pattern of steady-state acetylation between 7 and 17% at five of the six amino-terminal lysines and of monomethylation between 5 and 81% at five of the eight amino-terminal lysines in a pattern that may limit dynamic acetylation. An algal histone H3 sequence was confirmed by protein sequencing with a single threonine as residue 28 instead of the serine28-alanine29 sequence, present in all other known plant and animal H3 histones.",Immunology

A new composite free-flap model, namely, the saphenous artery osteomyocutaneous flap, is described in the rat. This is a true osteomyocutaneous flap composed of a skin island from the medial aspect of the lower leg, the gracilis and semitendinosus muscles, and a bone segment from the tibia based on the saphenous vascular pedicle. After anatomic studies in 10 rats, 20 flaps were transplanted microsurgically to the abdominal region in the recipient rats with a 90 percent success rate. In selected animals, arteriography was carried out. The results from gross observation of the flap survival and histologic and fluorochrome bone-labeling studies revealed a complete survival for each component of the flap in all animals with a patent vascular pedicle at 2 weeks after transfer. The model seems to be suitable for use in metabolic, vascular, and immunologic experimental studies on composite free flaps.",Immunology
7480282,"Quantification of functional deficits associated with rectus abdominis muscle flaps. To evaluate the deficits in trunk flexion due to partial or complete unilateral rectus abdominis muscle flap transfer in reconstructive surgery, 27 patients (11 females, 16 males) with rectus abdominis muscle flap transfer dating back at least 3 years, clinically healthy at the time of testing, and 22 controls (10 females and 12 males), comparable in age and body mass index, were compared. For clinical assessment of power of the straight and oblique abdominal muscles, Janda's test of muscle function was used, and torque (in N.m) of isometric trunk flexion at 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 degrees was determined with the TEF Modular Component, an auxiliary unit of the Cybex 6000. Results were analyzed for males and females separately. Relative torque (N.m/kg) of operated male and female patients was significantly lower (p < 0.05) as compared with controls. Differences were more pronounced in males than in females. Clinically, there were no significant between-group differences in the power of the straight and oblique abdominal muscles. In conclusion, trunk flexion deficits following rectus abdominis muscle flap transfer can be compensated for satisfactorily in most cases, supporting the use of this muscle in reconstructive surgery, if patients are selected carefully.",Immunology
7480277,"Aesthetic restoration of the severely disfigured face in burn victims: a comprehensive strategy. Although highly specialized burn centers have significantly reduced mortality rates following extensive total body surface area burns, survivors are often left with grotesque facial disfigurement. The strategy of modern facial restoration emphasizes enhancement of aesthetic appearance as significantly as mitigation of functional impairment. Criteria for success are (1) an undistracted ""normal"" look at conversational distance, (2) facial balance and symmetry, (3) distinct aesthetic units fused by inconspicuous scars, (4) ""doughy"" skin texture appropriate for corrective makeup, and (5) dynamic facial expression. Since 1985, the author has successfully restored 17 severely disfigured burned faces by replacement of entire aesthetic units with microvascular ""prepatterned"" composite flaps blended into the facial canvas by cosmetic camouflage techniques. The series includes hemiface (2), neck/jaw (5), chin/lower lip (3), cheek/malar (5), peri-orbital (2), nose (3), upper lip (4), and ear reconstructions (4). Flaps represented are free preauricular (1), radial forearm (6), ulnar forearm (1), free scapular (6), ilio-osteocutaneous (2), temporoparietal (8), vascularized forehead island (3), supraclavicular (1), and SMAS (1). Important to outcome is extensive initial intraoperative ""sculpting"" to simulate normal planes and contours. Seams are placed at junctions of facial components. Three-dimensional imaging is used to assess architectural asymmetries, and bone grafts are aided by computer-generated acrylic models. Adjunctive procedures include tensor fasciae latae slings, intraoperative tissue expansion, suction-assisted lipectomy, and scar management. After restoration of facial form and texture, flesh color make-up and/or tattooing of beard, lips, scars, eyebrows, etc., aid to hide scars and pigment the skin to harmonize with the rest of the face. In all cases, facial integrity has been aesthetically restored and, in most instances, with makeup, is near normal in social settings at conversational distances. Facial animation is retained and color matches are excellent. One flap was lost early in the series.",Immunology

7479967,"Periodicity of strong nucleosome positioning sites around the chicken adult beta-globin gene may encode regularly spaced chromatin. Positioned nucleosomes contribute to both the structure and the function of the chromatin fiber and can play a decisive role in controlling gene expression. We have mapped, at high resolution, the translational positions adopted by limiting amounts of core histone octamers reconstituted onto 4.4 kb of DNA comprising the entire chicken adult beta-globin gene, its enhancer, and flanking sequences. The octamer displays extensive variation in its affinity for different positioning sites, the range exhibited being about 2 orders of magnitude greater than that of the initial binding of the octamer. Strong positioning sites are located 5' and 3' of the globin gene and in the second intron but are absent from the coding regions. These sites exhibit a periodicity (approximately 200 bp) similar to the average spacing of nucleosomes on the inactive beta-globin gene in vivo, which could indicate their involvement in packaging the gene into higher-order chromatin structure. Overlapping, alternative octamer positioning sites commonly exhibit spacings of 20 and 40 bp, but not of 10 bp. These short-range periodicities could reflect features of the core particle structure contributing to the pronounced sequence-dependent manner in which the core histone octamer interacts with DNA.",Immunology

7479944,"Restriction-modification systems as genomic parasites in competition for specific sequences. Restriction-modification (RM) systems are believed to have evolved to protect cells from foreign DNA. However, this hypothesis may not be sufficient to explain the diversity and specificity in sequence recognition, as well as other properties, of these systems. We report that the EcoRI restriction endonuclease-modification methylase (rm) gene pair stabilizes plasmids that carry it and that this stabilization is blocked by an RM of the same sequence specificity (EcoRI or its isoschizomer, Rsr I) but not by an RM of a different specificity (PaeR7I) on another plasmid. The PaeR7I rm likewise stabilizes plasmids, unless an rm gene pair with identical sequence specificity is present. Our analysis supports the following model for stabilization and incompatibility: the descendants of cells that have lost an rm gene pair expose the recognition sites in their chromosomes to lethal attack by any remaining restriction enzymes unless modification by another RM system of the same specificity protects these sites. Competition for specific sequences among these selfish genes may have generated the great diversity and specificity in sequence recognition among RM systems. Such altruistic suicide strategies, similar to those found in virus-infected cells, may have allowed selfish RM systems to spread by effectively competing with other selfish genes.",Immunology
7479810,"Training and search methods for speech recognition. Speech recognition involves three processes: extraction of acoustic indices from the speech signal, estimation of the probability that the observed index string was caused by a hypothesized utterance segment, and determination of the recognized utterance via a search among hypothesized alternatives. This paper is not concerned with the first process. Estimation of the probability of an index string involves a model of index production by any given utterance segment (e.g., a word). Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used for this purpose [Makhoul, J. & Schwartz, R. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92, 9956-9963]. Their parameters are state transition probabilities and output probability distributions associated with the transitions. The Baum algorithm that obtains the values of these parameters from speech data via their successive reestimation will be described in this paper. The recognizer wishes to find the most probable utterance that could have caused the observed acoustic index string. That probability is the product of two factors: the probability that the utterance will produce the string and the probability that the speaker will wish to produce the utterance (the language model probability). Even if the vocabulary size is moderate, it is impossible to search for the utterance exhaustively. One practical algorithm is described [Viterbi, A. J. (1967) IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory IT-13, 260-267] that, given the index string, has a high likelihood of finding the most probable utterance.",Immunology

The effects of chronic administration of hydrocortisone (10 mg/kg/day) on the development and evolution of acute pancreatitis induced by supramaximal stimulation with cerulein were examined in the rat. In these circumstances the potentially therapeutic effect of L-364,718, a CCK-receptor antagonist, was assayed. Administration of hydrocortisone over 7 days did not increase the severity of edematous acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein, since the reduction in pancreatic secretion, the hyperamylasemia and the increase in the levels of hematocrit and fluid in the pancreatic tissue were similar in rats with acute pancreatitis treated and untreated with hydrocortisone previously. When hydrocortisone was administered chronically, before administration of supramaximal doses of cerulein, a spontaneous regression of acute pancreatitis occurred. However, when hydrocortisone administration was continued after inducing pancreatitis, pancreatic recovery was prevented, observing a significantly depressed acinar secretion and elevated values of hematocrit and tissue fluid (edema). L-364,718 administration proved to be detrimental in the evolution of edematous acute pancreatitis when the rats had been treated chronically with hydrocortisone because the blockade exerted on secretion prevented the draining of enzymes stored in excess by hydrocortisone administration.",Immunology

7477877,"Priming of a D1 dopamine receptor behavioural response is dissociated from striatal immediate-early gene activity. Repeated administration of direct-acting (apomorphine, SKF-38393, quinpirole) or indirect-acting (amphetamine, cocaine) dopaminergic agonists can produce enhancement of locomotor and sterotypic behaviours in response to subsequent dopamine agonist challenge. This sensitization of dopamine receptors, known as priming or reverse tolerance, is long-lasting and appears to be dependent upon the participation of the N-methyl-D-asparate excitatory amino acid receptor. The mechanism underlying dopamine receptor sensitization is not understood. Mounting evidence suggests that immediate-early genes may provide a link whereby extracellular stimuli are converted into long-term changes in neuronal activity. In the present study, behavioural measurements and immunohistochemical techniques were used to determine whether induction of the immediate-early gene c-fos is critical to the mechanism underlying priming of a D1-mediated behavioural response. It was demonstrated that in drug-naive rats bearing unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway, the mixed D1/D2 agonist apomorphine produced a dramatic increase in the expression of Fos-like immunoreactivity in the ipsilateral caudoputamen, nucleus accumbens and globus pallidus, and was a potent primer of SKF-38393-mediated rotational behaviour. In contrast, saline administration did not increase Fos expression and did not prime SKF-38393-elicited rotation. Preadministration of MK-801 at 0.5 mg/kg significantly reduced apomorphine's effect on Fos expression and prevented apomorphine priming of SKF-38393-induced rotation. However, at a lower dose of 0.1 mg/kg, MK-801 had little effect on apomorphine-mediated Fos expression but did block the priming response. In another experiment, the D2 family-selective agonist quinpirole was found to be an affective primer of SKF-38393-mediated rotation, and to produce increase Fos expression in the ipsilateral globus pallidus only. Preadministration of MK-801 at 0.1 mg/kg blocked quinpirole priming of SKF-38393-mediated rotation and significantly reduced the number of Fos-positive neurons in the ipsilateral globus pallidus. Administration of the indirect dopamine agonist amphetamine increased Fos expression in the intact striatum, but not in the ipsilateral (lesioned) striatum or globus pallidus, and did not sensitize (prime) animals to behavioural effects of SKF-38393.

MCS-1 reacted with peripheral blood granulocytes, but not with monocytes, whereas MCS-2 reacted with both granulocytes and monocytes. The incidence of MCS-1 and MCS-2 reactivity with the cells from a total of 121 patients with various type of leukemias was as follows: 25/46 (54%) and 39/47 (83%) in acute myeloblastic leukemia and acute monoblastic leukemia, 8/16 and 16/16 in chronic myeloid leukemia in blastic crisis (CML-BC) of myeloid type, 0/7 and 2/7 in CML-BC of lymphoid type, 0/26 and 2/32 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 7/7 and 7/7 in chronic phase of CML, respectively.

In each case the binding was higher in the mother than in the fetus (p less than 0.01). Plasma alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP) concentrations were higher (p less than 0.01) in maternal than in fetal samples, and there was a correlation between meperidine B/F and plasma alpha 1-AGP concentration for the maternal and fetal samples (r = 0.752, p less than 0.01). Binding studies with purified alpha 1-AGP showed that this was a cause-effect relationship. The transplacental binding differential was attributable partially to the maternal-fetal difference of plasma alpha 1-AGP concentrations. Meperidine was 17.5 +/- 0.35% bound in a 3.5 gm/100 ml solution of human serum albumin; however, there was an inverse correlation (r = -0.798, p less than 0.01) between B/F and plasma albumin concentration for the maternal and fetal samples. A relatively large proportion (75%) of the overall variability in B/F was accounted for by plasma alpha 1-AGP and albumin. Plasma binding of this basic drug was not greatly influenced by the perinatal levels of bilirubin and nonesterified fatty acids. The common clinical observation of greater fetal than maternal plasma total meperidine concentrations at delivery is not the result of more extensive protein binding in fetal than in maternal plasma.",Immunology

As a mass produced device which can be programmed according to application, the microprocessor is an obvious choice of component in hospital instrumentation for a wide range of activities from routine surveillance and process control to individual research projects. Until recently the development of an instrument from the naked processor has often proved to be labour intensive with control over both cost and timescale from design to completion difficult to maintain. Difficulties are frequently experienced in the areas of providing suitable communication channels for both data collection and immediate information for the operator and mass data storage. In our view, the arrival of the PET on the scene, as an example of a microprocessor based package including keyboard, video display, flexible I/0 ports, simple tape recorder and high level programming language has opened up new opportunities for those wishing to use microprocessors without tears. This paper describes how the authors have confirmed this view by successfully using the PET in particular data logging application.

Deep body temperature increased from 39.5 to 41.1 degrees C. Breathing frequency increased 29 times, compared to the thermoneutral condition. Tidal volume decreased to 18% of the pre-panting value, and the total ventilatory volume increased by 5.4 times. End-tidal PCO2 and PO2 values decreased and increased, respectively. The swans developed a slight respiratory alkalosis; arterial PCO2 decreased from an average of 27.1 to 25.7 mmHG and arterial pH increased from 7.501 to 7.559. Cardiac output, heart rate and stroke volume were 106%, 154%, and 70%, respectively, of the values at thermoneutrality. Mean arterial blood pressure and total peripheral resistance were slightly reduced. It is concluded that the increased ventilation during panting mainly constitutes dead space ventilation resulting from the great reduction in tidal volume.

Serum levels of androgen were higher during the late part of the light phase of the light : darkness (LD) cycle than during the late part of the dark phase during three consecutive days in intact male rats. The serum concentration of androgen in blood samples obtained at hourly intervals from individual male rats fluctuated markedly with occasionally as much as a tenfold difference between the highest and lowest values. Evidence was presented that endogenous pulses in the concentrations of androgen in serum of male rats occur during the late part of the light phase and the early and middle parts of the dark phase of the LD cycle. Induction of sexual behaviour by injections of testosterone in castrated rats depended on the time of injection, and the period of maximum behavioural sensitivity to testosterone coincided with the time of the LD cycle when pulses in androgen levels in serum normally occurred in intact rats. Injection of testosterone produced extremely high concentrations of androgen in serum within 0.5 h of injection but these levels declined rapidly thereafter. Testosterone implants, which produced low levels of androgen that did not vary with the LD cycle, were considerably more potent than testosterone injections in stimulating sexual behaviour in castrated rats.",Immunology

Since idiopathic osteonecrosis (IO) has been observed to occur in association with abnormalities of fat metabolism, eight inbred rabbits with heritable hyperlipidemia were examined for IO. Studies of circulating fatty elements and peripheral tissues were also done. Necrotic changes in 60% of the femoral heads were observed by light and electron microscopic examinations. The most characteristic changes included thickening of the subchondral bone trabeculae due to reactive new bone on dead bone, diminished marrow cavities filled with fatty tissue, haversian canals with fat, and loss or pyknosis of osteocyte nuclei with cytoplasmic ""fatty"" vacuolation. Sudan-IV-positive substances were frequently observed in the osteocytes of necrotic trabeculae. The appositional new bone lining dead trabeculae was also subject to necrotic change. Diseased vessels or emboli in the location of bone necrosis were not observed. Electrophoresis of serum lipoproteins showed a marked decrease in high density lipoprotein (HDL) associated with the accumulation of lipids in the peripheral tissues. These changes may represent a failure in lipid transport. Based on these aberrations, we propose that the decrease in HDL may play a role in the pathogenesis of IO in rabbits with heritable hyperlipemia.",Immunology

This study examines the relation between whole body O2 requirements and lung growth. 6-week-old hamsters were exposed to cold (5 degrees C) or injected with thyroid hormone. These treatments elevated O2 consumption by 26% over a 28-day period. Both alveolar surface area and total lung air volume were increased by approximately 25% in each group. Morphometric data suggest that lung enlargement was due to an increase in the number or complexity, rather than size of individual alveolar units. Further elevating O2 demand by increasing thyroid dosage did not enhance lung size beyond the level observed with the lowest dose used. Depressing metabolic rate with an antithyroid drug for four weeks had no effect on lung structure (in this animal model). Results indicate that in hamsters, increased physiologic O2 demand may be met to a certain extent by augmentation of the pulmonary diffusing surface.",Immunology

After preparation the films usually showed an absoprtion maximum at 635 nm or in some cases at 640 nm. The PChl form with 635 nm absorption maximum had no CD signal, whilst the films with absorption maximum at 640 nm gave an intense negative CD band at about 640 nm and a positive one at 668 nm. The treatment of the films with ammonia or acetone vapour resulted in a red shift of the absorption maximum from 635 nm or 640 nm to 650 nm. The study of the CD spectra of the films with different PChl forms showed that, depending on the treatment, forms of PChl with similar absorption and fluorescence spectra, but with opposite CD signals, can exist. It is suggested that the differences of the CD spectra are mainly due to different arrangements of the aggregates.",Immunology

Recent evidence suggests that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors play an important role in the etiology and maintenance of chronic nociception. Previous studies have demonstrated that tissue injury or stimulation of nociceptive afferent projections results in the expansion of receptive fields, hyperalgesia and C-fiber-induced wind-up, events that can be inhibited by N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists. This study examines the effect of unilateral hind paw inflammation on N-methyl-D-aspartate R1 messenger RNA and [125I]dizocilpine maleate binding in the L4-L5 segments of the lumbar spinal cord of rats. Spinal cords were examined at 7.5 h, three, seven and 20 days after injection of the left hind paw with 120 microliters of complete Freund's adjuvant. N-methyl-D-aspartate R1 messenger RNA, as measured with in situ hybridization, was observed to decrease bilaterally in laminae I, II and X of the lumbar spinal cord. This decrease was evident in laminae I and II at 7.5 h and three days after hind paw injection. In lamina X, a postinjection decrease in hybridization signal was observed at 7.5 h and seven days. A bilateral decrease in [125I]dizocilpine maleate binding was observed in laminae I and II at three, seven and 20 days after paw injection. This observed decrease in binding at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor suggests a compensatory mechanism by which N-methyl-D-aspartate-mediated nociceptive events may be modulated.",Immunology
7477756,"Estimation of critical closing pressure in the cerebral circulation of newborns. We have developed a method to estimate the critical closing pressure (CrCP) of the cerebral circulation based on the intrinsic variability of arterial blood pressure (BP) around stable values of mean arterial pressure (MAP). A consecutive cohort of 33 premature newborns was studied at 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours of age. Cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) was measured with Doppler ultrasound in the middle cerebral artery and BP was recorded in the abdominal aorta or in a peripheral artery. Continuous measurements lasting five minutes were recorded on digital magnetic tape and signals were digitized at a rate of 200 samples/seconds for processing on a digital computer. Mean values of BP (mBP) and CBFV (mBV) were computed for each cardiac cycle and CrCP was determined as the pressure axis intercept of the regression line of mBV as a function of mBP using 100 sequential heart beats. The resistance-area product (RAP) was obtained from the slope of the regression line. For 57 records (30 patients) the mean +/- SD values of CrCP and RAP were 23.9 +/- 11.6 mmHg and 4.07 +/- 1.83 x 10(4) kg.m-2.s-1, respectively. CrCP has a highly significant correlation with mean arterial pressure (p < 0.001) but RAP has not. Neither CrCP nor RAP are significantly correlated (p > 0.05) with PO2, PCO2, pH, haematocrit, gestational age, birthweight, postnatal age, heart rate on Pourcelot's resistance index. Our results suggest that cerebral perfusion pressure should be defined as MAP-CrCP for normal values of intracranial pressure.",Immunology

Neuronal migration disorders are a group of malformations of the brain which primarily affect development of the cerebral cortex. The best known of these is lissencephaly (smooth brain). Most types result from incomplete neuronal migration to the cortex during the third and fourth months of gestation. In this review, we describe and illustrate the different types of neuronal migration disorders. We also review the many different genetic syndromes associated with neuronal migration disorders. Over 25 syndromes with lissencephaly or other neuronal migration disorders have been described. Among them are syndromes with several different patterns of inheritance including chromosomal or new mutation autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked and unknown. Genetic counseling thus differs greatly between syndromes. The genes responsible for several of the lissencephaly syndromes have been mapped. X-linked lissencephaly has tentatively been mapped to chromosome Xq22 based on observation of a single X-autosomal translocation in a girl. Both Miller-Dieker syndrome and isolated lissencephaly sequence (in many patients) were mapped to chromosome 17p13.3 by detection of deletions and other structural chromosome rearrangements.

High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation is a therapeutic option for patients with chemotherapy-sensitive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have relapses. In this report we describe a prospective randomized study of such treatment. A total of 215 patients with relapses of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were treated between July 1987 and June 1994. All patients received two courses of conventional chemotherapy. The 109 patients who had a response to chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive four courses of chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (54 patients) or radiotherapy plus intensive chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (55 patients). The overall rate of response to conventional chemotherapy was 58 percent; among patients with relapses after chemotherapy, the response rate was 64 percent, and among those with relapses during chemotherapy, the response rate was 21 percent. There were three deaths from toxic effects among the patients in the transplantation group, and none among those in the group receiving chemotherapy without transplantation. The two groups did not differ in terms of prognostic factors. The median follow-up time was 63 months. The response rate was 84 percent after bone marrow transplantation and 44 percent after chemotherapy without transplantation. At five years, the rate of event-free survival was 46 percent in the transplantation group and 12 percent in the group receiving chemotherapy without transplantation (P = 0.001), and the rate of overall survival was 53 and 32 percent, respectively (P = 0.038).

Reverse-transcriptase inhibitors have only moderate clinical efficacy against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Ritonavir is an inhibitor of HIV-1 protease with potent in vitro anti-HIV properties and good oral bioavailability. We evaluated the antiviral activity and safety of ritonavir in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1 and 2 study of 84 HIV-positive patients with 50 or more CD4+ lymphocytes per cubic millimeter. The patients were randomly assigned to one of four regimens of ritonavir therapy, or to placebo for four weeks and then (by random assignment) to one of the ritonavir regimens. During the first 4 weeks, increases in CD4+ lymphocyte counts and reductions in the log number of copies of HIV-1 RNA per milliliter of plasma were similar among the four dosage groups, but in the three lower-dosage groups there was a return to base-line levels by 16 weeks. After 32 weeks, in the seven patients in the highest-dosage group (600 mg of ritonavir every 12 hours), the median increase from base line in the CD4+ lymphocyte count was 230 cells per cubic millimeter, and the mean decrease in the plasma concentration of HIV-1 RNA (as measured by a branched-DNA assay) was 0.81 log (95 percent confidence interval, 0.40 to 1.22). In a subgroup of 17 patients in the two higher-dosage groups, RNA was also measured with an assay based on the polymerase chain reaction, and after eight weeks of treatment there was a mean maximal decrease in viral RNA of 1.94 log (95 percent confidence interval, 1.37 to 2.51). Adverse events included nausea, circumoral paresthesia, elevated hepatic aminotransferase levels, and elevated triglyceride levels.

Amiodarone is effective in the treatment of supraventricular and ventricular cardiac arrhythmia, however a high incidence of toxic side effects has been observed in various organs and tissues during chronic treatment. Ultrastructural observation of affected tissues reveals myelinoid inclusion bodies. The exact pathogenetic mechanism of these changes is still unknown. In this study we investigated the biochemical effects of this drug on lysosomal hydrolases and the alterations induced in subcellular organelles of fibroblasts cultured for 24 h with different concentrations of amiodarone in the medium. Of the enzyme activities assayed, we only observed a significant reduction in sphingomyelinase. Ultrastructural observation of fibroblasts showed swollen lysosomes and a few onionoid inclusion bodies at lower concentrations of the drug; at higher concentrations the lysosomal system was severely impaired. Cytochemical staining of unesterified cholesterol with filipin showed accumulation of cholesterol. We conclude that chronic amiodarone treatment in experimental conditions induces inhibition in sphingomyelinase activity through interaction with membrane lipids and modification of bilayer structure. Higher concentrations of the drug impair cholesterol transport and induce lipid accumulation.

The quantity of the silver-stained nucleolar proteins (AgNOR proteins) measured in situ in cytohistologic preparations is related to the rapidity of cell proliferation. The term ""AgNOR proteins"" comprises several proteins. The relationship between the individual AgNOR protein amount and cell proliferating activity is not yet known. We studied the quantitative distribution of the individual AgNOR proteins, with specific attention to the two major AgNOR proteins, nucleolin and protein B23, in seven human cancer cell lines characterized by different cell doubling times. The doubling time of cancer cells was measured by counting the asynchronously growing cells at regular time intervals. The AgNOR proteins were quantified in situ, after a specific one-step staining procedure, by computerized image analysis. For the quantitative evaluation of nucleolin and protein B23, two methods were followed. Nuclear proteins after separation by SDS-PAGE were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and were either: 1) stained by the silver staining procedure for AgNOR proteins or 2) treated with anti-nucleolin and anti-protein B23 mAb followed by reaction with secondary Ab linked to peroxidase and revealed by chemiluminescence and autoradiography. In both cases, measurement of individual AgNOR protein and nucleolin and protein B23 amount was carried out using computerized densitometric analysis. Integrated density values of the silver-stained bands at 105 kDa (nucleolin) and 38 to 39 kDa (protein B23) represented, in all cell lines, more than 60% of the total silver-stained band value. A relationship was found between the densitometric values of silver-stained nucleolin and protein B23 and rapidity of cell proliferation (r = 0.85 and r = 0.86, respectively, p < 0.05). The values of nucleolin and protein B23 obtained using the Western blots were strictly related to the rapidity of cell proliferation (r = 0.93 and 0.96, respectively, p < 0.001). Finally, a good correlation was observed between the mean AgNOR protein area value, as defined in cytologic preparations in situ, and nucleolin and protein B23 amounts as evaluated in silver-stained nitrocellulose membranes (r = 0.92 and r = 0.90, respectively, p < 0.01) and in Western blots (r = 0.95 and r = 0.94, respectively, p < 0.001). These data indicate that the quantitative changes of AgNOR proteins observed in cytohistologic preparations in situ mainly reflect the quantitative changes of nucleolin and protein B23 and demonstrate that nucleolin and protein B23 amounts are inversely related to cell doubling time in human cancer cells.",Immunology

In solid-phase enzyme immunoassay, which is a more popular and convenient method, antibody (antigen) is usually bound to the support by physical adsorption, and B/F separation is accomplished by washing the solid phase. Covalent binding of proteins, DNA, and oligosaccharides is also possible by using chemically modified supports. Indirect binding of antibody (antigen) to the support mediated by avidin-biotin methods has several merits in comparison with direct methods and double antibody methods. The immune complex transfer method has been used for ultrasensitive assays. The use of magnetic particles as a support can accelerate the immune complex formation, and is becoming more popular in clinical laboratories. A rapid sandwich enzyme immunoassay, using a porous filter as a support, has been developed for dry chemistry.",Immunology
7474360,"Effects of atrioventricular intervals on right atrial monophasic action potential duration during pacing or reciprocating tachycardia. We evaluated the relationship between changes in the atrioventricular (AV) intervals and right atrial monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization (RA-MAPD90) in humans. In 4 patients, RA-MAPD90 was measured during AV reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT, n = 2) or AV node reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT, n = 2) and atrial or ventricular pacing at similar cycle lengths. In 10 patients, RA-MAPD90 was measured during continuous atrioventricular sequential pacing at AV intervals of 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350 msec for 90 sec at a cycle length of 333-400 msec. In patients with AVRT, the RA-MAPD90 during tachycardia was shorter than RA-MAPD90 during RA or RV pacing. In patients with AVNRT, RA-MAPD90 during tachycardia was similar or longer than RA-MAPD90 during RA or RV pacing. As the AV interval was increased from 0 msec to 150 msec, the peak right atrial pressure decreased from 8-12 mmHg to 2-3 mmHg. RA-MAPD90 decreased to its minimal value at an AV interval of 150 msec. The maximal difference in the RA-MAPD90 obtained by changing the AV interval was 22.5 +/- 3.0 msec. We conclude that 1) a very short AV or VA interval causes an increase in RA-MAPD90 which correlates with an increase in RA pressure, and 2) RA-MAPD90 during supraventricular tachycardia is different from RA-MAPD90 during atrial or ventricular pacing. Thus, a contraction-excitation feedback mechanism may exist in the human atrium.",Immunology

Mg(2+)-dependent, electrogenic, Na-inositol co-transporter on the plasma or sarcolemma (SL) membrane (Rubin and Hale, 1993). The ion specificity and stoichiometry of this transport process is unknown. Using bovine cardiac SL vesicles, we have determined that transmembrane movement of myo-[3H]inositol requires Na+ and is not supported by K+ or Li+. Furthermore, replacing Cl- with a non-permeant anion has no effect on inositol transport. Carrier-mediated inositol efflux indicated that efflux was Na(+)-dependent and electrogenic but independent of extravesicular Mg2+ in the efflux media. The transport stoichiometry of 1 Na+ for one inositol was derived by determining the null point of myo-[3H]inositol flux under conditions where the inside and outside concentration (ratio) of myoinositol and Na+ were controlled. The results suggest that Na+, inositol, and Mg2+ bind to the same side of the membrane for transport to occur and that the stoichiometry of Na+ and inositol transport is 1:1.",Immunology
7473769,"Asymmetrical electrically induced injury of rabbit ventricular myocytes. Strong defibrillation-type electric field stimulation may injure myocytes when transmembrane potentials during the pulse exceed the threshold for membrane permeabilization. The location of injury may depend on intrinsic transmembrane potential or influx of calcium by ""electro-osmosis"" during the stimulation pulse in addition to the transmembrane potential changes induced by the pulse. We have studied injury by examining contracture and changes in transmembrane potential-sensitive dye fluorescence induced by electric field stimulation (St) with a duration of 20 ms and strength of 16-400 V/cm in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes. St of 100-150 V/cm produced injury in myocytes oriented parallel to the St field frequently without injuring myocytes oriented perpendicular to the field. Injury required calcium in the solution and was asymmetric, occurring first at the myocyte and facing the St anode in 100% of injured myocytes in normal Tyrode's solution. Injury depended significantly on whether the product of the electric field strength and myocyte length exceeded a threshold of 1.1 V (P < 0.05). Asymmetric injury at the end facing the anode was still present in 96% of injured myocytes for stimulation after depolarization by an action potential or 20 mM or 125 mM potassium, suggesting that intrinsic transmembrane potential is not responsible for asymmetry. In 125 mM potassium, eliminating calcium from the bathing solution during the St pulse and introducing calcium after the pulse decreased the fraction of injured myocytes in which injury occurred at the end facing the anode to 62%, suggesting that calcium influx by ""electro-osmosis"" at the myocyte end facing the anode contributes to asymmetry. Asymmetric injury at the end facing the anode was still present in 100% of injured myocytes after adding 1 mM tetraethylammonium chloride, indicating that asymmetry is not sensitive to the potassium channel blockade. For stimulation pulses stronger than 50 V/cm given after depolarization by an action potential, transmembrane potentials at both myocyte ends decayed after the initial deflection indicating that permeabilization occurred at both ends. In conclusion, injury depends on myocyte orientation and is asymmetric occurring first at the myocyte end facing the anode. Asymmetric injury is not explained by asymmetric permeabilization, is independent of the intrinsic transmembrane potential and may result from ""electro-osmosis"" during the stimulation pulse.",Immunology
7473686,"Magnitude and modulation of pancreatic beta-cell gap junction electrical conductance in situ. The parallel gap junction electrical conductance between a beta-cell and its nearest neighbors was measured by using an intracellular microelectrode to clamp the voltage of a beta-cell within a bursting islet of Langerhans. The holding current records consisted of bursts of inward current due to the synchronized oscillations in membrane potential of the surrounding cells. The membrane potential record of the impaled cell, obtained in current clamp mode, was used to estimate the behavior of the surrounding cells during voltage clamp, and the coupling conductance was calculated by dividing the magnitude of the current bursts by that of the voltage bursts. The histogram of coupling conductance magnitude from 26 cells was bimodal with peaks at 2.5 and 3.5 nS, indicating heterogeneity in extent of electrical communication within the islet of Langerhans. Gap junction conductance reversibly decreased when the temperature was lowered from 37 to 30 degrees C and when the extracellular calcium concentration was raised from 2.56 to 7.56 mM. The coupling conductance decreased slightly during the active phase of the burst. Activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin (10 microM) resulted in an increase in cell-to-cell electrical coupling. We conclude that beta-cell gap junction conductance can be measured in situ under near physiological conditions. Furthermore, the magnitude and physiological regulation of beta-cell gap junction conductance suggest that intercellular electrical communication plays an important role in the function of the endocrine pancreas.",Immunology

Spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1) is caused by expansion of an unstable CAG triplet repeat located on the short arm of chromosome 6. Precise mapping has shown a positional relationship to closely linked markers in the order of D6S109-D6S274-D6S288-SCA1-AM10GA-D6S89+ ++-EDN1 from centromere to telomere. The haplotype which cosegregated with the disease was determined in 12 Japanese pedigrees with SCA1. Although the alleles of the SCA1 haplotype varied from pedigree to pedigree, depending on the distance from the SCA1 locus, the affected and presymptomatic subjects carried the same alleles at D6S288 and D6S274. All the families with SCA1 had migrated from either Miyagi or Yamagata Prefectures, neighbouring areas in the Tohoku District, the northern part of Honshu which is the main island of Japan. It seems highly likely that SCA1 in the Japanese, at least those residing in Hokkaido, derives from a single common ancestry.",Immunology

The effects of stimulating hindlimb extensor nerves (100-200 ms trains, 100 Hz, < or = 2 times threshold) during the flexor and extensor phases of the locomotor step cycle were analysed in the decerebrate, paralysed cat during fictive locomotion evoked by stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region. 2. Stimulation during extension of either the medial gastrocnemius (MG), lateral gastrocnemius-soleus (LGS) or plantaris (Pl) nerves was equally effective in increasing the duration and amplitude of electroneurogram (ENG) activity recorded in ipsilateral ankle, knee and hip extensor nerves. Enhancement of extensor ENG activity could be evoked with near threshold stimulation intensity and appeared within 10-40 ms of the onset of ankle extensor nerve stimulation. Stimulation of anterior biceps during extension occasionally evoked a modest increase in the duration of activity of hip, knee and ankle extensors. Stimulation of quadriceps during extension enhanced the activity of proximal extensors and soleus, but inhibited other ankle extensors. 3. Selective activation of ankle extensor Ia spindle afferents by muscle stretch also enhanced ipsilateral extension. It is argued that both muscle spindle and tendon organ afferents can contribute to the increase in extensor nerve activity evoked by group I stimulation intensity during fictive locomotion. 4. During flexion, stimulation of either the MG, Pl or LGS nerves at group I strength terminated on-going activity in ipsilateral flexors and initiated a burst of activity in ipsilateral hip, knee and ankle extensors, i.e. reset the step cycle to extension. 5. Low strength stimulation of the mixed muscle and cutaneous nerve innervating the plantar aspect of the foot produced extension enhancement and resetting similar to that evoked by group I muscle afferent stimulation. Stimulation of the cutaneous nerve supplying the dorsal aspect of the foot during extension enhanced extensor activity, and during flexion, enhanced the activity of flexors. 6. The effects reported here during fictive locomotion may also occur during overground locomotion with natural activation of group I muscle spindle and tendon organ afferents. Extensor spindle and tendon organ afferents may thus serve as an excitatory reflex system helping to shape the amplitude, duration and timing of ipsilateral extensor activity. Increased or unexpected activation of group I ankle extensor afferents or plantar foot afferents during locomotion could also compensate for increased loading of the limb.",Immunology

Research on counterfactual thinking has shown that people's emotional responses to events are influenced by their thoughts about ""what might have been."" The authors extend these findings by documenting a familiar occasion in which those who are objectively better off nonetheless feel worse. In particular, an analysis of the emotional reactions of bronze and silver medalists at the 1992 Summer Olympics--both at the conclusion of their events and on the medal stand--indicates that bronze medalists tend to be happier than silver medalists. The authors attribute these results to the fact that the most compelling counterfactual alternative for the silver medalist is winning the gold, whereas for the bronze medalist it is finishing without a medal. Support for this interpretation was obtained from the 1992 Olympics and the 1994 Empire State Games. The discussion focuses on the implications of endowment and contrast for well being.",Immunology

The authors sought to determine whether endogenous splenic tissue placed in a subcutaneous pouch (""spleen-o-port"") could function as a viable alternative to central venous catheters/ports for long-term venous access. A small transverse incision was made in the left upper quadrant of each puppy (n = 6) under general anesthesia. Using a stapler, the authors divided the splenic parenchyma. The superior portion was returned to its native location, and a subcutaneous pocket was created to house the inferior pole with its attached vascular supply. The fascial and muscular layers were closed with care to avoid compressing the blood supply to the spleen-o-port. Postoperatively the dogs resumed normal activity. There have been no deaths, infectious complications, splenic ruptures, or thromboses over a 6-month period. Under fluoroscopy, the dogs were imaged from postoperative day (POD) 10 to 177. Contrast agent entering the splenic parenchyma was promptly visualized in the splenic vein and then filled the portal vein. Electrolyte measurements from spleen-o-port blood samples were identical to those from peripheral venous samples. After gentamicin (mixed in a crystalloid solution) was infused through the spleen-o-port, the peak serum level corresponded to the therapeutic levels observed after standard intravenous administration. The spleen-o-port permits rapid infusion of drugs and crystalloid, and allows repetitive blood sampling while eliminating the foreign body that can promote septicemia in the immunocompromised patient.",Immunology

Five cases of this soft tissue infection were treated at the authors' institution between January and December 1993. Three of the children were profoundly neutropenic secondary to chemotherapy.

In addition, the patients with neutropenia received a combination of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and granulocyte transfusions. One child died of overwhelming sepsis and bone marrow graft failure. The others eventually made a complete recovery. Necrotizing fasciitis may be becoming a more common problem in children. Aggressive chemotherapeutic regimens and more frequent use of bone marrow transplantation could be a factor in this. Early diagnosis and aggressive surgical therapy is critical.

In one out of two cases, posterior shoulder luxation is a diagnostic, clinical, and radiological ""trap"", which we feel has no true justification. In fact, contrary to what is generally admitted, a good analysis of the frontal image can easily suggest the diagnosis in most cases. All that is required is knowledge of the two principal indirect signs of posterior luxation. Increase in size of the glenohumeral interline is almost constantly present (12 out of 14 cases), and the ""compression-fracture"" of the anterior face of the head is often visible (9 out of 14 cases). Furthermore, if a strictly frontal film of the glenohumeral interline is requested in all cases of shoulder injury, the diagnosis of luxation is evident as the head is projected into the glenoid cavity. Profile films must also be taken. When the luxation is of recent origin, axillary profile films are usually impossible to take, and trans-thoracic profile films of the upper end of the humerus are taken, even though these do not show the glenohumeral interline. For this reason, it is essential to request an immediate Bloom and Obatas' profile. This incidence confirms the presence of posterior luxation and enables the anterior face of the head and the posterior glenoid rim to be studied. The diagnostic value of the two principal indirect signs of posterior luxation, as seen in frontal films and Bloom and Obatas' glenohumeral profile, is undeniable.

In order to evaluate the role of acetylcholine in human placenta, the effects of the above ChA inhibitors on the uptake of [alpha-14C]aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) by isolated human placental villi were studied. All three inhibitors were able to inhibit AIB uptake by the tissue. The ID50 for BETA, the most potent compound, was about 6.2 x 10(-5) M. The blockade of AIB uptake closely paralleled the potency for inhibition of ChA in a series of keto-analogs of acetylcholine related to BETA. There was a positive relationship between the blockade of AIB uptake and the inhibition of ChA by BETA in situ. Hemicholinium-3 had no significant effect on AIB uptake. The ChA inhibitors did not exhibit significant effects on cell viability as determined by tissue lactic dehydrogenase.

In order to study the metabolic responses of humans consuming a diet moderately high in cholesterol content, we carried out a long-term sterol balance study, up to 25 weeks in duration. Two subjects, one normocholesterolemic and one hypercholesterolemic, were given, in sequence, a very low cholesterol diet and then a diet containing 1000 mg cholesterol per day. The plasma lipids, lipoproteins, cholesterol absorption and synthesis, and fecal steroid excretion were then measured during the different dietary periods (10-14 weeks of a very low cholesterol diet and 11 weeks of a moderately high cholesterol diet). During the high cholestrol dietary period, the plasma cholesterol level increased from 280 to 427 mg/dl for Subject 1 and from 123 to 166 mg/dl for Subject 2. The low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol increased from 215 to 318 mg/dl and from 76 to 112 mg/dl. The high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol also increased. Of the possible compensatory mechanisms against cholesterol overloading from the diet, two mechanisms were partially effective: cholesterol biosynthesis decreased (feedback inhibition) and bile acid excretion increased. Cholesterol absorption remained unchanged after the high cholesterol diet and was not a compensatory mechanism despite earlier assumptions that it might be. In spite of these compensatory mechanisms, the cholesterol feeding led to a 44% increase in the plasma cholesterol levels of these subjects. The predominant component of the plasma cholesterol increase was in the cholesterol transported by LDL and with presumably greater atherogenicity as a result. In the hypercholesterolemic subject, the LDL/HDL ratio increased and there was a net storage of cholesterol in the body. Storage of cholesterol did not occur in the normal subject.",Immunology

Fifteen young healthy subjects (7 males and 8 females) participated in three 5-d diet periods. Dietary intake during each dietary period consisted of: 1) low nitrogen and low calcium [0.49 +/- 0.11 g protein/ (kg.d), 429 +/- 190 mg calcium/d]; 2) low nitrogen and high calcium [0.44 +/- 0.08 g protein/(kg.d), 1643 +/- 171 mg calcium/d]; and 3) a high nitrogen and high calcium [2.71 +/- 0.75 g protein/(kg.d), 1589 +/- 633 mg calcium/d] diet, and this was compared with subjects' baseline dietary intake [0.99 +/- 0.51 g protein/(kg.d), 589 +/- 152 mg calcium/d]. The order of these diets was randomly assigned. Twenty-four-hour and 3-h urine samples were collected before and during each dietary period and were analyzed for pyridinium cross-links (pyridinoline, deoxypyridinoline), nitrogen and creatinine. The rate of pyrdinium cross-link excretion did not vary with protein intake but was approximately 33% lower (P < 0.01) during periods of high compared with low calcium intake.

The purpose of the present study is to investigate how reciprocal inhibition influences the mechanical and electromyographic (EMG) properties of the ankle plantar flexors in humans during a voluntary contraction. 2. At different levels of maintained plantar flexion contractions ranging from 0 to 20 Nm, the size of the soleus EMG stretch reflex and the ankle joint stiffness (ration between the torque increment and the amplitude of the stretch) were measured in response to an imposed dorsiflexion. At matched plantar flexion contraction levels, stretch responses were compared before and after reversible block of the common peroneal nerve (CPN). Stretch responses were also measured during an attempted voluntary fictive dorsiflexion after CPN block. 3.

Compared with colocated median or ulnar nerve responses, the radial nerve response had 1) an initial short-latency response in the middle laminae that was subtle; there was a small transmembrane current flow component without a discernable multiunit activity correlate; and 2) a laminar sequence and distribution of activity that was similar to those of the median or ulnar nerve responses (i.e., initial activation of the middle, followed by upper and lower laminae), but the significant current flow and multiunit response to radial nerve stimulation occurs 12-15 ms later. 4. Normal corepresentation of nondominant dorsum hand (radial) inputs with the dominant (median or ulnar) inputs in the glabrous hand surface representation provides a clear vehicle for the biased patterns of reorganization occurring after peripheral nerve section. The initial, ""subtle"" activity phase in the nondominant response is believed to reflect intracortical inhibition, and the later ""significant"" response phase, a rebound excitation, possibly compounded by an indirect or extralemniscal input. The spatiotemporal pattern of nondominant input is proposed to play a role in normal somatosensory perception.",Immunology

A prospective analysis of the nonstress test revealed a group of patients who demonstrate typical variable decelerations associated with fetal movement. Such variable decelerations were observed only in patients who had the test performed for suspected intrauterine growth retardation or for postdatism. Almost half of the suspected small-for-gestational-age fetuses and fetuses of a postdate gestation who demonstrated variable deceleration at nonstress testing also demonstrated an umbilical cord in an abnormal position at delivery. The position of the cord in utero of the remaining patients with variable deceleration at nonstress testing was not determined; however, 88% of this group demonstrated significant variable deceleration during labor. An abnormally positioned cord was noted in half of the patients undergoing cesarean section. It appears that patients with small-for-gestational-age fetuses and those with postdate gestation are at higher risk of intrapartum cord compression problems when variable decelerations are noted with fetal movements during a nonstress test.",Immunology

Although isoproterenol is the sympathomimetic amine used most often to augment cardiovascular function in infants and children, little is known about the hemodynamic effects of this drug on the immature cardiovascular system. To compare the hemodynamic effect of isoproterenol in the young animal with that in the mature animal, we infused the drug into 11 puppies of 12-38 days of age, 12 puppies of 56-89 days of age and 10 adult beagle dogs. The animals were chronically instrumented and nonsedated during the study. Isoproterenol was infused in doses of 0.05, 0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 microgram/kg/min. Isoproterenol decreased systemic arterial mean blood pressure, increased heart rate and had no effect on renal blood flow in all three groups of animals. While cardiac output was increased and systemic vascular resistance decreased in the adult dogs, neither changed in puppies. Stroke volume increased slightly in adult dogs, but decreased in puppies. This refractoriness to change of cardiac output in immature dogs may be a function of elevated resting cardiac output, developmental changes of contractility or ventricular compliance or developmental changes of vascular smooth muscle responsiveness.",Immunology

Dopamine levels in the spinal cord and catecholamine levels in various brain regions were not markedly affected. 2. When ether anesthesia was used spinal noradrenaline was found to be almost completely depleted by the administration of 6-OHDA. Only partial depletion was achieved when pentobarbitone anaesthesia or neuroleptic analgesia was used. 3. The blood pressure rise caused by electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus was not affected by 6-OHDA treatment 7 days previously. 4. 6-OHDA administration did not influence the development of two-kidney Goldblatt hypertension.

Stress evaluation was carried out in 26 patients approximately 7 months after aortic valve replacement with Björk-Shiley valves (13 patients) and St. Jude medical valves (13 patients). During isoproterenol infusion (0.3 micrograms/kg/min), cardiac output increased by a factor of 1.5 and aortic valve area decreased by 50% for both valve groups, while transvalvular gradients (rest: 7 +/- 2 vs 10 +/- 5 mm Hg, p greater than 0.05) increased by 42 +/- 18 vs 51 +/- 18 mm Hg (p greater than 0.05), i.e., to levels of moderate aortic stenosis. However, during pacing stress these values progressively decreased with rising heart rates. In other postoperative evaluations that included ergometric stress with isoproterenol and pacing, induced hemodynamic changes after aortic valve replacement were predictable and consistent with regard to both direction and magnitude, and they differed characteristically according to the type of stress used. We conclude that no functional differences between Björk-Shiley and St. Jude medical valves can be claimed. Standardized evaluation with isoproterenol is a sensitive stress test of prosthetic valvular hemodynamics. Because of the apparent magnification of residual obstruction after aortic valve replacement, it has advantages over pacing.",Immunology

Mice that had received transplants of sarcoma-180 followed by treatment with sporamycin were examined histopathologically at periodic intervals. A marked degeneration of tumor cells was observed at an early stage after the administration of sporamycin, but the degeneration subsequently ceased and regrowth of the tumor was seen. Marked infiltration of lymphoid cells, granulation tissue, and fibrosis was seen in the stroma or surrounding tissue of the tumor at a late stage after the administration of sporamycin, and the regression of tumor cells became marked. With a few exceptions the mice were completely cured by about the 40th day. In the peripheral lymphoid tissues, a transitory decrease in the number of cells was observed after the administration of sporamycin, but this was followed by regeneration of the cells, followed by a marked increase in the B cell system. On the other hand, lymphoid cell depletion of the thymus had persisted. Transplantation of intact sarcoma-180 to mice preliminarily inoculated with sporamycin-treated sarcoma-180 cells resulted in inhibition of tumor growth in most of the mice, and qualitatively the same tissue reactions as those in mice cured of sarcoma-180 by sporamycin were seen. The results suggest that enhancement both of antigenicity of the tumor (cells) and of the subsequent immune response of the host by sporamycin may be involved in the cure of the experimental tumor.",Immunology

To test this hypothesis, male Fischer rats were randomized to receive 85 to 90% jejunoileal resection or bypass, subtotal colectomy, or no operation (controls). One week later, the first of six weekly s.c. injections of azoxymethane (15 mg/kg/week) was given. At the 36th week postoperatively, mean body weight after enterectomy or colectomy it was 78 to 79% of control. Adaptation after all three operations was characterized by 22 to 84% increments in villous height and crypt depth in the residual functioning ileum (p = 0.05 to 0.001); the depth of colonic crypts was unchanged. Fewer rats developed intestinal tumors after enteric bypass (36%) than after any of the other treatments (80 to 91%) (p = 0.01 to 0.001); the depth of colonic crypts was unchanged. Fewer rats developed intestinal tumors after enteric bypass (36%) than after any of the other treatments (80 to 91%) (p = 0.01 to 0.001). Compared with controls, bypass reduced the number of colonic tumors by 77% (p less than 0.001). Although resection did not affect colonic tumor yield, it tripled the incidence of tumors in the duodenum and jejunum (p = 0.025). Colectomy promoted rectal carcinogenesis (p less than 0.05). Anastomotic tumors were commoner after intestinal resection. the lower frequency of tumors after jejunoileal bypass contrasts with enhanced carcinogenesis after enterectomy or colectomy.

Studies utilizing the technique of simultaneous microperfusion of peritubular capillaries and tubular lumen of the proximal tubule of the rat were performed to determine if the absorption of urate was an active transport process and to determine the passive permeability coefficient for urate. When radioactive urate of equal specific activity and concentration was present in both perfusion solutions, the ratio of collected to initial concentrations of urate in the luminal perfusate (CO/CI) was 0.71 +/- 0.02. This gradient was higher than that predicted at equilibrium from the electrical potential difference determined in the in vitro perfused rabbit proximal tubule. The addition of para-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB) to both solutions resulted in a significantly higher CO/CI of 0.90 +/- 0.02. This latter value is closer to the value predicted at electrochemical equilibrium. In separate studies, the unidirectional fluxes of urate were determined in the presence of PCMB. The calculated passive permeability coefficient averaged approximately 0.94 pmol . min-1 . mm-1 . mM-1 and was equal in both directions.

Beside the yield of labeled erythrocytes the purity of the suspension of erythrocytes ready for injection from nonerythrocyte activity (NE51Cr) is an important criterion for the quality of the 51Cr-labeling method. After presentation of an especially precise method for measuring the NE51Cr the parameters influencing the NE51Cr in the main were investigated and the NE51Cr was analysed using different methods of separation of its components. ACD was used as anticoagulant. The results demonstrate that chromate-ions diffuse into the erythrocyte nearly completely in a very short time (max. 2.5 min). The incubation time (ICT: Time of the contact of erythrocyte and 51Cr) has an important influence in forming charged and/or neutral chromium (III)-citrate-complexes, which diffuse in part into the erythrocyte and lose the chromium ion inside the erythrocyte to other binding partners. The ion exchangeable anionic chromium-citrate-complexes preponderate in main against neutral and possibly existing cationic complexes. This part increases with increasing ICT. Only about the half of the complexes is protein bound (loosely in main), only a minimal part of the activity can be precipitated by ethanol. Using standard conditions in the Signette-method for rapidly 51Cr-labeling of erythrocytes with purification by an anionexchanger (ICT: 10 min) the NE51Cr is about 2.5%. The influence of varied conditions can be read form a nomogram. Reducing agents in the blood have some importance in extreme conditions, e. g. after 2.5 g L-ascorbic acid the NE51Cr is 5%.

Meant by the microsurgical treatment of syndromes of lumbar nerve root compression caused by disk herniation, is the simultaneous use of a microsurgical, monosegmental access, and the execution of the operation by means of the operation microscope. Based on our own experience over more than 3 years, we describe the technique of the microsurgical access, as well as the procedure in 67 cases of lumbar disk herniation. The advantages, but also the risks of this surgical method are mentioned, and the indication for microsurgical treatment of lumbar disk herniations is commented on. Advantages are the reduced trauma of the dorsal musculature, and the improved ability to preserve tissue by use of the microscope with it's excellent illumination and magnification of the operation field. Compared with the conventional method, markedly lesser wound pain, as well as rarer micturitional disturbances, are observed postoperatively. Long term results have only been infrequent up to now. There-fore, the microsurgical treatment of lumbar disk herniation, despite it's undeniable advantages, cannot be viewed as an alternative to the hitherto practiced conventional operating methods. In these methods a magnification technique (telescope glasses), focusable light sources and perfectionized instruments can also enable us to keep the operational access restricted.",Immunology

Studies measuring the glycolytic intermediate and adenine nucleotide concentrations in Trypanosoma brucei metabolising glucose either aerobically or under conditions where glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase is inactive have shown the following: 1. Inhibition with 0.5 mM salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) accurately simulates anaerobic conditions in T. brucei; 2. On inhibition of respiring cells with 0.5 mM SHAM, the concentrations of most glycolytic intermediates decrease; they decrease further as the concentration of glycerol, an end product, increases. Only the concentration of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate is increased. This increase depends upon the method of preparation but is independent of time and glycerol concentration. 3. Glycerol formation from sn-glycerol-3-phosphate is coupled to the phosphorylation of another compound. The results of these studies are consistent with this compound being ADP; 4, The degree of inhibition of the anaerobic metabolism of glucose exerted by glycerol varies with the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate concentration, implying that the effect of glycerol is at the site of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate: ADP transphosphorylation.",Immunology

The effects of a tumor-promoting agent on the frequency of mutation to ouabain resistance and survival of Chinese hamster cells treated with a chemical carcinogen have been investigated. 12-O-Tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) significantly enhanced the mutation frequency induced by the carcinogen, methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM), without having similar effects on cytotoxicity, at concentrations of 2 micrograms/ml or less. The observed degree of enhancement of mutagenesis increased with promoter concentration up to the point where the latter exhibited frank toxicity. Exposure of the cells to the promoter for a period of 2 or 6 h was found ineffective, but subsequently a significant enhancement was found after a 27-h exposure time. The maximum effect occurred after a 5-day exposure, with a increase in the mutation frequency of 250%. Treatment of cells with TPA alone resulted in no enhancement of spontaneous mutation rates, nor did treatment of cells prior to addition of carcinogen-induced mutagenesis. In contrast, TPA was found to be effective when applied as late as 6 weeks following carcinogen treatment. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that TPA owes its promoting activity toward chemically-induced mutagenesis and carcinogenesis to its ability to enhance expression of latent somatic genetic modifications by epigenetic mechanisms. They do not support mechanisms involving TPA-induced inhibition of DNA-repair replication, or mutagenic activity of TPA per se. The notably similar qualitative response to TPA of several parameters in mouse-skin tumorigenesis and Chinese hamster cell mutagenesis suggest that the mechanism of action of the promoter is similar in the 2 diverse biological systems.",Immunology

A major diagonal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was acutely occluded in 17 baboons. Complete left ventricular (LV) decompression was achieved with a left heart bypass (LHB) system in six baboons while 11 baboons served as untreated controls. In the treated group, LHB was initiated after 30 minutes of coronary occlusion. For a period of 6 hours after occlusion, aortic pressure, LV pressure, left atrial pressure, and cardiac output were monitored. During the same monitoring period, electrograms were recorded from a high resolution matrix of fixed epicardial electrodes. Regional myocardial blood flow was determined prior to and at intervals following the initiation of LHB with radioactive microspheres. Infarct size was assessed histologically from serial cross sections of the left ventricle. The degree of salvage achieved by LHB was assessed by comparing the epicardial area of infarction 6 hours after occlusion (AI) to the area of epicardial St-segment elevation (STE) 30 minutes after occlusion (maxAST). In the LHB-treated group, 40.0% +/- 8.1% (SEM) of maxAST showed subsequent infarction; in the control group, 79.8% +/- 2.7% of maxAST showed eventual infarction (p less than 0.01). STE overlying the region of ischemia in the LHB-treated group did not undergo the spontaneous decline observed in the control group, which is normally associated with the progression of necrosis. Regional myocardial blood flow did not change significantly in the ischemic region during the period of occlusion following LHB. LHB. The results suggest that LHB is capable of substantial salvage of acutely ischemic myocardium by reducing myocardial work and thus reducing myocardial oxygen requirements.",Immunology

Thirteen major wound complications required wide debridement and, of these, five could be closed only with skin grafts. Eight wounds were infected, two with Staphylococcus aureus and six with mixed gram-negative flora. Ninety-three percent of these wounds were in the thigh. Average weight of patients with leg wound complications was 73.5 +/- 3.5 kg and not different from that of a randomly selected control group (73.8 +/-1.2 kg). However, 40% of the patients were women, a much higher incidence than control (p less than 0.005). Hospital stay increased significantly from 12.1 +/- 0.5 days for the control group to 24 +/- 2.6 days for the group with wound complications (p less than 0.005).

The heat production of frog skeletal muscle during isometric contraction was measured with an infrared radiometer at room temperature (23--26 degrees C), attention being focused on the heat produced during the summation of twitches by two successive stimuli. When the amount of heat produced by the second stimulus was plotted against the corresponding tension increment, the data points fell on two regression lines of approximately the same slope except for the intermediate stimulus intervals. One regression line started from the origin, while the other intersected the ordinate at about 1 mcal/g. If a twitch was produced at various times after a 0.5 sec tetanus, all the data points on the heat versus tension increment plot distributed around a single regression line starting from the origin. These results are explained by assuming that the relation between the tension-dependent heat and the tension increment in a twitch produced after a preceding mechanical response remains nearly constant irrespective of the stimulus interval, while the amount of tension-independent heat production varies depending on the time after the preceding stimulation.",Immunology

First-transit and gated blood-pool radionuclide angiocardiography are two fundamentally different methods for scintigraphic examination of the heart. Both are equally accurate methods of measuring left ventricular ejection fraction as shown by comparison with cineangiography (correlation coefficients range 0.84 t 0.95). Both methods demonstrate a high degree of reproducibility in the results obtained from repeated determinations of ejection fraction in the same patient (correlation coefficients range 0.93 to 0.95). Additionally, both methods enable assessment of segmental ventricular wall motion and volumes; while there is good agreement between scintigraphic and cineangiographic findings with respect to wall motion, quantification of volumes remains problematic. Shunt assessment and calculation of transit times can only be obtained with the first-transit method. Notable advantages of the blood-pool method are simplicity and the ability to obtain multiple repeated studies for several hours after a single injection of imaging agent. The major disadvantages of the blood pool method are the problem of chamber superimposition which substantially complicates the process of wall motion analysis and the temporal and spatial distortion of data inherent to the need for relatively long imaging times. The chief advantage of the first-transit method is temporal separation of right and left heart imaging. This allows easy and accurate assessment of ventricular wall motion from any view desired. Short acquisition time makes heart rate variation and patient motion less critical. The most notable disadvantages of the first-transit method are the necessity to inject at additional bolus of imaging agent for each study performed and the complexities of performing and processing the studies.",Immunology

The WBGT values were compared with the Wet Globe Temperature (WGT) measured with a Botsball. Measurements were made visually on the instruments at regular intervals and an automated data collection system also was used to obtain data from thermocouples attached to the instruments. Statisticallly significant differences in WBGT readings were found among the instruments; however, the difference for a given environment usually was less than 0.5 degrees C. Readings taken by visual observations resulted in WBGT values which differed by less than 0.3 degrees C from those calculated from the automated data collection system. By using an equation derived for the Botsball, WBGT = 1.044 WGT - 0.187 (in degrees C), it is possible to convert the Botsball thermometer dial to indicate the conventional WBGT for outdoor environments, thus making it a simple instrument for assessing environmental heat stress at the work site.",Immunology

The concept of self is connected with its counterpart in the concepts of objective, subjective and transitional reality. The potential space of the Self is shown to be restricted rather than enhanced by an overemphasis on the role of empathy. This overemphasis is then related to narcissistic problems in the analyst himself. Self-psychology turns back the clock as it splits instead of integrates its relation with psychoanalysis, reducing so-called ""classical analysis"" to rigid conflict psychology as opposed to self-psychology, which claims the most central functions of the ego thereby confiscating the third episode in the development of the ego concept in Freud's work. Kohut's description of the transitional process in the psychoanalytic situation predominantly in terms of only one of its constituents, the empathic immersion, is considered to be related to his position vis-à-vis the drives. Using only experiential, as opposed to observational, categories he cannot but arrive at the conclusion that drive intensity is not the cause of central pathology but its result. This creates an imbalance in the clinical view that not only narcissistic mortification indeed produces drive manifestations but on the other hand intensive drive impulses also may produce a severe narcissistic mortification. An attempt is made to find theoretical conceptualizations preserving drive psychology as well as self-psychology by differentiating between a function and its content, i.e. the product of that function, the representation. The interdependence in the ""working relation"" of self and ego, of subjective experiencing and objective functioning, of our sense of freedom and our conviction of determinism is clarified. The seeming contradictions and conceptual confusion might also be related to an insufficient distinction between our two basic modes of perceiving the world, diacritic and coenaesthetic perception.",Immunology
7440054,"Nuclear magnetic resonance study of a hybrid of bovine and rat ribonuclease. A hybrid RNase S', consisting of synthetic S-peptide of rat ribonuclease and bovine S-protein, was studied by 1H n.m.r. to determine the effects of the many N-terminal amino acid replacements in rat S-peptide as compared to bovine S-peptide. As judged from the aromatic resonances, the conformation of the hybrid RNase S' is essentially identical to the conformation of bovine RNase S'. Notably, the active-site histidines 12 and 119 were not affected by the substitutions in the S-peptide, confirming earlier findings that the catalytic properties of naturally occurring RNases are modulated by the S-protein part of the molecule only. However, the resonances of Tyr-25 and His-48, which in RNase A are involved in a pH-dependent conformational transition, appeared to be different in the hybrid RNase, demonstrating that amino acid replacements may influence the structure of the protein locally.",Immunology
7431231,"Effects of tetraethylammonium chloride on contractile, membrane and cable properties of rabbit artery muscle. 1. Two types of effects of tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) have been found in the smooth muscle cells of the rabbit main pulmonary artery. (a) With rapid onset of action TEA depolarizes the cell membrane, increases the membrane resistance, causes anomalous rectification and occasionally spike potentials in response to externally applied depolarizing current pulses and produces tonic contractions. (b) During prolonged (greater than 30 min) incubation in TEA phasic contractions develop progressively and the vascular strips respond to electrical stimulation with synchronized and powerful contractions. 2. There is a linear relationship between log concentration TEA and depolarization over the range of 10-100 mM-TEA. TEA (10 and 30 mM) raises the membrane resistance and decreases the core resistance. The latter effect appeared to develop more slowly than the former. 3. During short exposure to TEA part of the smooth muscle cells respond to depolarizing current pulses with spike potentials of variable amplitude and duration. These spikes are very sensitive to inhibition by verapamil or nickel chloride but are not affected by tetrodotoxin. The amplitude of electrotonic potentials, increased by TEA, is slightly further elevated by verapamil or nickle chloride. 4. TEA (10 mM) increases the mechanical response to low and intermediate potassium concentrations but has no effect on maximal contractions to high potassium. The slope of the line relating log potassium concentration to membrane potential is decreased by TEA. 5. TEA (10 mM) shifts the concentration response curve for the contractile effect of noradrenaline to the left and increases the maximum of noradrenaline-induced contractions. In the presence of TEA, noradrenaline reduces the membrane potential to markedly lower values than under control conditions. 6. It is concluded that the rapidly occurring effects of TEA on the vascular smooth muscle cells of the rabbit main pulmonary artery are a decrease in potassium and an increase in calcium conductance. The latter effect may be related to a blockade of potassium channels; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that TEA affects calcium conductance independent of its presumed action on potassium channels. The slowly developing effects of TEA may be ascribed to the formation of gap junctions and/or (less likely) to an intracellular accumulation of TEA.",Immunology

The interaction of human serum albumin with monomeric haemin has been investigated by detailed kinetic analysis in dimethyl sulphoxide/water (3:5, v/v). The results obtained under conditions of albumin saturation of haemin and under pseudo-single turnover conditions indicate that methaemalbumin is formed in a two-stage, single-intermediate process. The initial association between the haemin and human serum albumin is a chemically controlled process (k1 = 1.7 X 10(5) mol-1 . s-1 . dm3 at 24 degrees C); the variation of K1 with pH exhibited a well defined pK of 5.9. The overall equilibrium constant, calculated by using microscopic rate constants, is 1.1 (+/- 0.5) X 10(8) mol-1 at 24 degrees C.

To show that corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), a plasma glycoprotein, is synthesized in the liver as well as to develop a tool with which to study the hormonal factors which control its synthesis, we undertook to translate rat CBG mRNA in vitro. Rat liver mRNA was translated in the presence of [35S]methionine in both a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (cell-free) System and a Xenopus laevis oocyte (whole cell) system. A monospecific antibody against highly purified rat CBG was used to precipitate a single 35S-labeled product from the mixture of newly synthesized hepatic proteins in the two systems. In the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, the protein migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 41,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis; CBG isolated from rat serum migrated as a doublet with apparent molecular weights of 56,000 and 62,500. Since proteins synthesized by a cell-free system are not glycosylated, the difference in molecular weight can probably be accounted for by the carbohydrate content of plasma CBG. Translation of rat liver mRNA in a Xenopus laevis oocyte system again resulted in immunoprecipitation of a single 35S-labeled protein, but this time with an apparent molecular weight of 53,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis; this probably represents glycosylated CBG and corresponds to the apparent molecular weight of one of the species isolated from rat plasma.",Immunology

From this ratio of binding affinities, one would expect some agonist or antagonist activity of 2-OHE1 to be apparent at doses roughly 20-50 times the minimum effective dose of E2. Instead, at doses of 2-OHE1 1000 times an effective dose of E2, no uterotropic effect was observed. When 2-OHE1 was injected together with E2 at dose ratios of 500:1, there was no antagonism of the effect of E2. To examine this discrepancy, the plasma MCRs (MCRpS) of E2 and 2-OHE1 were determined by continuous infusion techniques. Plasma concentrations of 2-OHE1 and E2 during control and infusion periods were measured by RIAs. The MCRp of 2-OHE1 averaged 50,000 ml/h, more than 100 times that of E2 (approximately 400 ml/h). The extraordinarily high MCRp of 2-OHE1 may explain the failure to observe any biological effects of this catechol estrogen, even at high doses.

The hypothesis was tested by challenging lymphocytes from normals and a patient with glutathione synthetase deficiency in vitro with acetaminophen metabolites generated by a mouse hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing system. For toxicity to be manifested in normal cells, glutathione content had to be depleted to less than 20% of control values at high acetaminophen concentrations (500 and 1,500 micrograms/ml), concentrations similar to blood levels in massive overdose and associated with hepatotoxicity in vivo.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of osmotic constituents of the incubation media on angiotensin II stimulation of arginine vasopressin (AVP) release from the organ-cultured guinea pig hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal complex (HNC). As reported previously, the addition of angiotensin II caused a significant increase in AVP release from the explants of HNC incubating in the normal culture medium. The media made hyperosmolar with sodium chloride also significantly increased AVP release from the explants. The addition of angiotensin II to the hyperosmolar sodium chloride caused a further increase in AVP release from the explants of HNC. However, the response to angiotensin II was not significantly different among the explants incubating in the hyposmolar, the isosmolar and the hyperosmolar sodium chloride solutions, indicating separate pathways of angiotensin II and osmotic stimuli in AVP release. In contrast, the response of the explants to angiotensin II was markedly suppressed when they were incubated in the media made hyperosmolar with excess glucose. Furthermore, the hyperosmolar media of excess urea failed to influence the angiotensin II-stimulated AVP release from the explants. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that excess glucose has a specific suppressive effect on AVP release from the neurohypophysis.",Immunology

7438593,"Impacted fixation over resilient multiple pins. Fractures of the neck of the femur require prompt treatment and an anatomic or translated reduction on the fracture table with traction applied parallel with the body. Valgus position is not satisfactory. The plate and minimum of nine pins, by hammer impaction at surgery, coapts the irregular surfaces. Strain-gauge studies showed that only 25% of the stress on the fracture site is borne by a ""tell-tale"" nail. Seventy-five percent of the stress is dissipated by the surrounding bone. It is essential to immediately secure the 75% support of the surrounding bone by impaction at surgery and by recording the degree of impaction on the chart. To accept shortening or collapse over the first six to eight weeks means six to eight weeks of secondary healing going through a cartilage phase instead of healing per primam. Avascular necrosis, if it occurs, will not manifest itself until six months later. In this period the fracture site is vulnerable to nonunion. One must promote primary endosteal bone healing with no cartilage and no motion at fracture site. Resilient fixation dissipates the forces tending to displace the fracture, yet holds it with sufficient rigidity to promote early prompt union, typically within nine weeks. Secure plate-stabilized properly applied fixation allows full weight-bearing on the third to fourth postoperative day.",Immunology

Immune complexes were measured by the fluid- and solid-phase Clq-binding assays. They were demonstrated frequently in all patients with liver disease, including those with viral hepatitis, alcoholic cirrhosis, chronic active and persistent hepatitis, drug-induced hepatitis and hepatic metastases. The presence of immune complexes was not specific for a given type of liver disease and did not correlate with hepatic dysfunction.

7438537,"Effect of preformed immune complexes on the clearance and tissue localization of single-stranded DNA in mice. Recent studies have shown that DNA is cleared from the circulation extremely rapidly by the liver, and that normal individuals have low or immeasurable levels of circulating DNA. In some patients with SLE and in NZB/W mice, however, significant amounts of free DNA as well as DNA-anti-DNA immune complexes have been found in the circulation, suggesting a possible defect in DNA clearance in these conditions. To delineate factors which might contribute to the persistence of DNA in the circulation, we have assessed the effects of immune complexes on the clearance of single stranded DNA in normal C57Bl/6J mice. HSA-anti-HSA immune complexes at five-fold antigen excess were injected intravenously and after a variable, the clearance of single-stranded DNA was determined. Clearance of all doses of DNA was markedly suppressed 6 to 12 hr after the administration of immune complexes and returned to normal by 24 hr. Immune complexes decreased DNA clearance by blocking the hepatic uptake of DNA without altering the distribution of DNA to other organs. Histology and studies on the effect of immune complexes on the clearance of bromosulphophthalein (BSP) and sulphur colloid suggest that immune complexes affect DNA clearance by altering hepatic blood flow. The results obtained in this study suggest that circulating immune complexes in patients with SLE or in other conditions may suppress normal DNA clearance, and thereby contribute to the persistence of DNA in the circulation.",Immunology

The particular characteristics of the anaesthesia in endovesical interventions, the pathophysiological peculiarities of the senium, the senile involution of the kidney, and a water and electrolyte balance often disturbed by urological complaints are among others the most important criteria which determine the choice of the anaesthesia in a senile patient when TUR-interventions are to be carried out. Based on an experience of many years, it is reported on the results of anaesthesia in 4,130 geriatric patients, among then 2,818 TUR-interventions.

Therefore, left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) function were prospectively assessed by ECG-gated blood pool radionuclide (RN) angiography in 25 consecutive patients who had sustained severe trauma including blunt chest injuries. Focal abnormalities of RV and LV wall motion were defined in 17 patients; 12, RV; two, LV; and three, biventricular. In two patients traumatic tricuspid insufficiency was also demonstrated, and subsequently verified by contrast angiography. Other means to detect myocardial contusion (enzymatic, electrocardiographic, and Tc-99m pyrophosphate scintigraphy) proved to be insensitive when compared to RN angiography. Two of the five deaths in the group were attributed to refractory arrhythmias. Surgical or post-mortem evidence of traumatic myocardial injury was obtained in five instances when RN angiography indicated contusion. Of the 13 patients available for followup examinations, 11 showed complete or partial resolution of the abnormality and two were unchanged. Comprehensive cardiopulmonary monitoring revealed an inverse relationship between right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (R2 = 0.42; p < 0.01) and between the PVR and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (R2 = 0.48; p < 0.01) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) (R2 = 0.69; p < 0.01). Further, as right ventricular end-diastolic volume (RVEDV) was increased in trauma, left ventricular function and compliance were reduced. In blunt chest trauma RV contusion occurs more frequently than previously recognized and positive RN angiography constitutes prima facie evidence of direct myocardial injury. Further, LV function remains preload dependent, but may be depressed by elevated PVR impeding the blood flow from RV to LV and/or decreases in LV compliance.",Immunology

Artificial hemoglobins have been prepared with Mn(III) and Zn(II) tetrasulfonated phthalocyanines in place of heme. Their structure and properties have been investigated by difference spectroscopy, CD, epr, electrophoresis, and molecular weight estimation. Spectrophotometric titration data indicate the ratio of the reagents in this process to be 1:1. The visible absorption spectra show the main peak at 625 nm for the manganese compound and 681 nm for the zinc one. It is evident from CD experiments that incorporation of MN(III)L into apohemoglobin increases helical content of the protein whereas that of Zn(II)L increases its unfolding due to the change of electronic configuration of Zn(II) ion on coordination with the protein. On the basis of spectroscopic and epr data, the formula of the manganese complex is suggested to be (O)Mn(IV)L-globin, whereas that of the zinc complex Zn(II)L-globin. Electrophoresis and molecular weight estimation indicate both complexes to be dimers. Manganese complex binds additional ligands as CN-, imidazole, CO, and NO. Spectroscopic and epr data indicate reduction of the manganese complex and formation of the NO adduct with probable formula (NO) + Mn(II)L-globin. Mechanism of this process is suggested.

Human endothelial culture supernatant (HECS) contains a factor(s) that enhances the proliferation of hybridoma cells as we reported previously. In the present paper, we found that, in comparison with endothelial cells, their supernatant exerts a much stronger growth-promoting effect on hybridoma cells, which can also be detected earlier. In a confluent culture of endothelial cells, detectable amounts of this factor(s) are produced after 2 hr of incubation, and the production is linear in time for 3 days. The enhancing effect of HECS on the proliferation of hybridoma cells appears to be independent of the concentration of cells in the culture. The activity of HECS is adsorbed to hybridoma or myeloma cells, but not to thymocytes. HECS acts on hybridoma cells by delivering a growth-promoting signal that induces the hybridoma cells to proliferate.",Immunology

For a long time estimating body weight has not been the sole parameter of knowledge of the body constituents and the method of measuring ""skin folds"" only was of value in differentiating between the ""thin mass"" and the ""fat mass"". The authors used Thomasset's method of determination of body fluid compartments by electrical impedance measurements to measure objectively the extra-cellular water content and the total water content, which means the thin mass and the fat mass of the body. It is possible in pregnancy to work out how much of the increase in weight comes from the maternal structures and how much from the utero-fetal mass. The authors point out that the impedance method makes it possible to determine independently the maternal body constituents and those of the fetus carried by the mother. In this way it is easy to work out in cases of pathological weight gain whether this has arisen because of oedema or because of becoming fat. Furthermore the authors point out that what they call ""eutrophy of pregnancy"", which is the normal weight gain brought about by pregnancy, is similar to the state of affairs brought about by women taking oral contraceptives, which they call ""oestroprogestative eutrophy"".",Immunology

In asthma, isoproterenol (ISO) and histamine (HIS) inhibition of PMN lysosomal enzyme release is impaired while the prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) response is normal. During a respiratory infection provoking asthma, the PMN response to ISO is further impaired. The PMN response to ISO, HIS, and PGE1 is similarly impaired following an in vitro incubation with a live influenza bivalent (A + B) vaccine.

7462401,"Altered adenylate cyclase kinetics in hyperfunctioning human parathyroid glands. Current evidence suggests that parathyroid gland adenylate cyclase is involved in the control of parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. Thus, the altered control of PTH release in hyperparathyroidism may relate to altered adenylate cyclase activation. Therefore, we examined adenylate cyclase kinetics in membrane preparations from hyperfunctioning human parathyroid glands and normal human and bovine parathyroid tissues. There were no differences in the affinity for ATP between enzymes of normal and pathological tissue. However, the enzyme in 10 hyperfunctioning glands showed increased affinity for Mg++. The activation constant for Mg++ (KaMg) of adenylate cyclase in normal human glands was 10.6 +/- 2 mM, a value not different from that of normal bovine parathyroid tissue (9.5 +/- 1 mM). In contrast, the adenylate cyclase in membrane preparations from three of four hyperplastic and six of seven adenomatous human glands showed a markedly reduced KaMg, ranging from 0.85-1.64 mM and from 1.58-6.46 mM, respectively. In one adenoma and one hyperplastic gland, the Ka of the enzyme for Mg++ was close to normal. The addition of guanylylimidodiphosphate or GTP to the incubation mixture increased, in a dose-dependent manner, the apparent KaMg of the enzyme in the abnormal tissue toward normal, suggesting a defective nucleotide regulatory site in the adenylate cyclase of hyperparathyroid glands. In addition, the hyperparathyroid gland enzyme was less susceptible to inhibition by calcium, requiring 0.7-1 mM Ca++ for 50% inhibition, whereas comparable inhibition of the normal adenylate cyclase was seen at 0.22-0.28 mM Ca++. We conclude that the abnormal control of PTH secretion in hyperparathyroidism may be related, at least in part, to alterations in the characteristics of parathyroid gland adenylate cyclase.",Immunology

Sucrose, dioxane, dimethylformamide and dimethylsulphoxide decreased the difference turbidity signal. Sucrose gradient centrifugation did not show any influence. Polyethylene glycols were investigated with regard to molecular weights as well as concentrations. In contrast to the low molecular weight solvents, polyethylene glycols with molecular weights from 600 up to 20,000 gave a clearly expressed increase in the development of turbidity as well as in the size of the final turbidity signal. By sucrose gradient centrifugation, it was found that polyethylene glycols of molecular weights from 1000 to 10,000 had a profound effect on the solubility of immune complexes. The influence depended on the molecular weight as well as on the concentration. By use of [14C]-labelled polyethylene glycol it was found that polyethylene glycols did not form stable complexes with immune complexes. Furthermore, it was found that the zoning phenomenon was retained in the presence of small concentrations of polyethylene glycols, but higher concentrations of polyethylene glycols caused even antigen-excess complexes to show turbidity.",Immunology

A 38 year old female, with chronic uncontrolled coeliac disease, presented with the rare complication of cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis. Detailed study failed to identify any cause for the vasculitis, other than the underlying coeliac disease. Haematuria and proteinuria with mesangial nephritis were also demonstrated on renal biopsy with electron microscopic study. It is speculated that exogenous or endogenous antigens permeated the abnormal small bowel mucosa leading to formation of circulating immune complexes. Subsequent tissue deposition of these complexes then resulted in vasculitis and nephritis. The skin lesions cleared completely after treatment with a strict gluten free diet.",Immunology

On sharp changes (from 20 to 42 degrees C and vice versa) of temperature of the thermode placed on the upper lip of anesthetized rabbit, the temperature under the epidermis at the depth of 0.1--0.2 mm changed at the rate of 2 degrees/sec by 17.6 degrees .C on the average. At the depth of 2--3 mm the temperature only changed by 4.5 degrees C at the rate of 0.015 degrees/sec. Simultaneous recording of single cold thermoreceptors revealed two types of responses to alteration of the thermode temperature: with rapid increase in the firing rate during cooling and sharp decrease during warming up (18 thermoreceptors); and with slow, gradual change of the firing rate (10 receptors). The data obtained suggest that the cold thermoreceptors are situated in different skin layers. This enables the organism to register the skin temperature gradient as well as the transdermal warmth flows.",Immunology

In 5 patients with retroperitoneal but without distant metastases, supraclavicular lymph nodes revealed tumor metastases, two of which had been clinically suspected. Depending on the staging system applied, the tumor stage had to be changed in 1 or 3 patients, respectively. For comparison, in 4 patients with distant metastases no metastatic involvement of the supraclavicular nodes was demonstrable. It is concluded that supraclavicular tumor spread is not indicative of distant metastasis and incurability.

The process of myelination in the central nervous system (CNS) of the rat (optic nerve) was studied with the freeze-fracturing technique and ultrathin sectioning to obtain information on the developmental mechanisms of interlamellar tight junctions. Using a tilting cartridge for analysis of thin sections, it could be demonstrated that during the initial phase of wrapping a tight junction formation develops between the joining tips of the oligodendrocytic process. In tannic acid-stained samples these junctions appear as typical quintuple-layered membrane fusions, while in potassium permanganate-stained material membrane thickenings between the apposing glial tips are prevalent. The latter configuration represents the characteristic feature of the so-called radial component of central myelin. Using the freeze-fracturing technique, a biphasic mode of the myelinic tight junction assembly was detected. It is suggested that tight junctions represent a prerequisite of the myelination process.",Immunology

Cellular uptake and transport of cholesterol and beta-sitosterol was studied in rat jejunal villus cells isolated by hyaluronidase dispersion. Sterol absorption was measured from micellar solutions using a Millipore filtration technique. In actively metabolizing cells both cholesterol and beta-sitosterol exhibited rapid initial uptake curves which leveled off after 10 min, corresponding approximately to a 1:1 sterol:phospholipid molar ratio within the microsomal membranes of the cell, which suggested a physicochemical end point. Using various proportions of cholesterol and beta-sitosterol in the incubation medium, it was shown that each sterol interfered with the absorption of the other, the one present in the highest concentration showing the relatively higher uptake. Mixtures of equimolar proportions were taken up by the cells in a ratio that slightly favoured beta-sitosterol, but significantly more cholesterol than beta-sitosterol was found to be transferred to the microsomes. The limited mass discrimination between cholesterol and beta-sitosterol seen in the isolated cells is in contrast to the preferential absorption of cholesterol in vivo. These studies demonstrate that the molecular basis for the differential transport of cholesterol and beta-sitosterol in the lymph observed in vivo must be sought at a higher level of physiological activity of the cells (e.g., chylomicron formation and secretion) than that achieved in the present experiments.",Immunology

No marked and reproducible abnormalities could be detected in the synthesis, or accumulation, of plasma membrane proteins of dystrophic muscle cells maintained in culture for periods of up to 6 days. Analysis of the relative rates of protein turnover, analysis of fucose incorporation into plasma membrane proteins, and comparison of iodinated cell surface proteins also failed to reveal distinct abnormalities in plasma membranes derived from cultured dystrophic muscle cells. Although the results obtained do not rule out an early defect in plasma membrane protein biosynthesis during the development of dystrophic skeletal muscle in vivo, they do demonstrate that the synthesis and assembly of at least the major plasma membrane proteins occur normally during the initial phases of terminal differentiation of isolated dystrophic skeletal muscle cells in tissue culture.",Immunology
7459674,"Phospholipids and membrane transport. The ability of membrane lipids to adopt nonbilayer configurations suggests dynamic roles for lipids in many functional abilities of biological membranes. In this work evidence supporting the involvement of lipids in three types of membrane transport process is presented and discussed. These transport processes include facilitated transbilayer transport of polar molecules, transport mechanisms involving fusion events, and transport possibilities arising from alternative membrane morphology. In particular it is shown that lipids such as cardiolipin, which adopt the hexagonal HII phase in the presence of Ca2+, may be logically proposed to facilitate Ca2+ transport across membranes via an inverted micellar intermediate. Alternatively, in transport processes such as exocytosis the ability of Ca2+ to generate membrane instabilities favouring nonbilayer alternatives suggests a crucial role of phospholipid in the fusion event vital to exocytotic release. Finally, nonbilayer lipid structures may be suggested to favour formation of isolated compartments connected by a continuous membrane where lateral diffusion processes can lead to transport. These various possibilities are summarized in a ""metamorphic mosaic"" model of biological membranes.",Immunology

Subjects exhaled to residual volume, inspired the air volume and completed a full inspiration with oxygen. C.O. and both slopes were positive with low air volumes and negative with a VC of air. The slope of phase IV showed a linear decrease with the increasing inspired air volume, and reached zero with an air volume of 38% VC. AT higher volumes it became progressively more negative. The slope of phase III and C.O. were highly positive with 10% to 50% VC air volume then subsequently decreased. The values for C.O. and the slope of phase III were significantly different (P < 0.001) from those of the slop of phase IV and the apex-base gradients predicted by the model of Milic-Emili et al.

However, lowering of media pH increased direct thermal cell death and, to a lesser extent, heat potentiation of radiation lethality.

After segmented retrograde intrabiliary injection of morphine, DHC treatment was shown to decrease the amount of MG recovered in bile but increase the amount of MG which appeared in the blood perfusate. That this effect was due to DHC affecting the transport of MG rather than inhibition of the metabolic conjugation of morphine to MG was directly demonstrated. DHC reduced the recovery of MG in bile after administration of MG by SRII. Also in vivo, DHC decreased the recovery of bile of MG give, i.v.

Thus, the effect of DHC can with some degree of specificity be ascribed to an effect on the transport of MG from liver to bile.",Immunology

Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and failure of donor stem cells to engraft permanently are two major obstacles to successful bone marrow transplantation. We evaluated the effect of a single large dose of anti-lymphocyte serum (ALS) on mice receiving various numbers of H-2 incompatible bone marrow cells. Most animals receiving lethal total body irradiation (TBI) and allogeneic marrow died within 45 days due to GVHD, A/J (H-2a), CBA/J (H-2k), and DBA/1J (H-2q) mice that were given ALS 6 to 24 hr before TBI and C57BL/6 (B6, H-2b) bone marrow 24 hr after irradiation survived in good health for more than 200 days. This result compared quite favorably with mice that received anti-Thy 1.2 and C-treated B6 bone marrow (90% survival at 100 days, 50% survival at 200 days). Engraftment of the allogeneic marrow was dose dependent. At 100 days after TBI, about 30% of the A/J mice given 2 x 10(6) bone marrow cells were complete chimeras, i.e., donor H-2 antigens could be detected on greater than 85% of the peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes of these mice. However, at a dose of 1 x 10(7) B6 bone marrow cells, 95% of the A/J mice were complete chimeras. Spleen and bone marrow from B6 leads to A/J chimeras and B6 leads to CBA chimeras were unable to induce lethal GVHD in TBI-treated mice that were syngeneic to the recipient. However, these cell preparations caused lethal GVHD in third party mice indicating that the lack of alloreactivity was specific to the strain in which the unresponsiveness was originally induced.",Immunology

The changes induced by alphaxalone-alphadolone (3:1) in the cerebral enzymatic activities of the Kreb's cycle (citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase) and electron transfer chain (total NADH-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome oxidase) were studied. In addition, the activation of lactate dehydrogenase (for the glycolytic pathway) and of acetylcholine esterase (as indicative of transmission) were investigated. These enzymatic activities were evaluated in the homogenate in toto and/or in the crude mitochondrial fraction of rat brain, since these enzymes are variously located in the cytoplasm. Two relationships were studied: a) dose/action (0.5, 1. 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 mg . kg-1) by measurements carried out 60 min after i.p. administration; b) time/action (16 mg . kg-1 i.p.; measurements 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min after administration). The results show that in both kinds of trials alphaxalone-adphadolone reduced only the activity of the enzyme cytochrome oxidase evaluated on the brain homogenate in toto. More specifically, with regard to the dose/action relationship, the effect occurred starting with the dose of 2 mg . kg-1 and did not take place linearly with the higher ones. As to the time/action relationship, the effect began 60 min after administration, the changes being observed also at the subsequent times.

A compound formerly obtained through the reduction of cyclohexanone o-nitrophenylhydrazone has been defined as cyclohexane-3-spiro-3,4-dihydro-1,2,4-benzotriazine, and its formation has been interpreted via air oxidation of a cyclic form of o-aminophenylhydrazone formed first. The extension of such a reaction to several o-nitrophenylhydrazones of aliphatic, alicyclic and arylaliphatic ketones has been investigated. Formation of 3,4-dihydro-1,2,4-benzotriazines disubstituted in position 3 happens as a general rule; yields are good so long as bulky groups or aromatic nuclei are not close to the hydrazone double bond, hindering the amino group addition either sterically or by charge dispersion.

It involves measuring to diffusion potentials, arising at salt concentration gradient on the SR membrane due to its anion and cation permeability differences. Visualization of processes of negative chloride potential arising in adding MeCl2 and its further dissipation was realized with diS-C3-(5). A/23187 and X-537A in small concentrations reduce the amplitude and the length of fluorescent signal, while in strong concentrations they fully prevent it. Dissipation kinetics of chloride potential caused by the SR membrane permeability for Me2+ is used for quantitative analysis of this permeability. It is shown that the parameter tau 1/2 corresponds to the moment of time when the inside concentration of Me2+ becomes equal to the geometric average of the initial concentrations of this ion. The relationship between tau 1/2 and the concentrations of the added MeCl2 and the penetration ion (K+) and temperature were studied. It was shown that the membrane permeability gain with increasing MeCl2 concentration is due to accelerating action of the membrane potential. A laser two-wave, two-beam installation was described which allows to study SR membrane permeability with potential-sensitive probe fluorescence and light scattering on the same sample. Correlation between the signals obtained simultaneously with these independent methods was shown.",Immunology

In 5,000 subjects, GVFDs developed in only 1.7% of eyes. Statistical analysis of 26 factors at first examination identified five that were significantly related to the development of GVFDs--outflow facility, age, applanation pressure, cup-disc ratio, and pressure change after water drinking. Their absolute initial value, and not its change with time, was the important predictor. Multivariate analysis showed their collective predictive power to be undesirably poor, indicating that other factors must play an important role in the development of GVFDs. Mortality-table analysis indicated that during a period of five years, 98.54% of eyes with initial pressure less than 20 mm Hg continued to be free from GVFDs as compared with 93.34% of those with pressure of 20 mm Hg or greater.",Immunology

Changes in coital experience, birth control usage, and sex education between 1968, 1971, 1974, and 1978 were studied in unmarried Canadian university students. The percentage of coitally experienced females increased from 32% in 1968 to 58% in 1978 and of males from 40% to 62%. There was no significant change between 1974 and 1978 for either sex, nor were there sex differences in coital experience in either year. Coitally experienced females were more likely to have had intercourse in the 3 months preceding both 1974 and 1978 surveys, but otherwise there were no sex differences in coital frequency, lifetime number of coital partners, or age at first intercourse. Religion was a more reliable indicator of coital experience in 1968 than in 1978. Males were more likely than females to report postpubertal sexual contacts which they classified as homosexual (16.5% vs. 7%) whereas 12-13% of both sexes reported no sexual contacts of any kind with another person. Contraceptive risk-taking was high at first intercourse and among those having infrequent coitus. However, both this group and more coitally active students were less likely to take such risks in 1978 than in 1968, almost entirely because of increased pill use.

The results after 21 days showed no significant differences among treatments in regard to body weight. In feed conversion, however, a significant difference was observed when diets prepared with raw beans were supplemented with 20 ppm of flavomycin. In the second experiment raw and autoclaved beans were supplemented with 0, 10, and 20 ppm of virginiamycin and 200 and 400 ppm of flavomycin to study the effect of these two antibiotics.

In this study, the effects of bile duct ligation on overall disposition on pentobarbital and meperidine in the rat have been assessed in vivo and in isolated perfused rat livers. A significant reduction in clearance of both compounds was seen in response to bile duct ligation. No change in protein binding of either drug was demonstrated, but alterations in initial volume of distribution of both drugs occurred in response to extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction. A significant reduction in the rate of perfusate flow was also seen in perfused liver experiments using livers from animals with previous bile duct ligation.

Dosage requirements were higher for the younger patients, however, considerable variability existed within age groups. In patients with normal serum creatinines, an 8-hour dosing interval was optimal in only 17 of the 46 patients.

Serum amyloid P-component (SAP) is a normal plasma glycoprotein apparently identical with the P-component associated with amyloid deposits. SAP shows extensive amino acid sequence homology with the C-reactive protein, and both have a similar molecular configuration. SAP undergoes calcium-dependent binding to zymosan, agarose, and amyloid fibrils, but its functional properties are not yet known. We report here that SAP agglutinates complement-(C) coated antibody-sensitized erythrocytes by a calcium-dependent reaction. SAP was found to interact predominantly with a modified form of bound C3b. This modification was achieved by prolonged treatment of EAC43 with heated normal human serum or with isolated C3bINA and beta 1H, and reactivity was reduced upon treatment of the cells with trypsin. SAP thus seems to react with fixed C3 in a manner similar to the reaction of C3 with bovine conglutinin, a molecule that also undergoes calcium-dependent binding to zymosan and agarose. These studies identify a new reactivity for SAP and demonstrate an interaction between an amyloid protein and the C system. The close similarity between the calcium-dependent binding specificities of SAP and of bovine conglutinin may assist in characterization of these molecules and in investigation of their function.",Immunology

Light harvesting (LH) bacteriochlorophyll (Bchl) protein complexes were isolated from chromatophores of Chromatium vinosum, by the combination of detergent solubilization, sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and hydroxyapatite chromatography. Addition of the absorption spectra of these complexes reproduced the absorption spectrum of chromatophores from which these complexes were derived. This result led to the conclusion that these isolated complexes retained the near-infrared absorption spectra which these complexes showed as they existed in chromatophores. Two kinds of spectrally different chromatophores were obtained under different culture conditions. One of them contained two kinds of LH Bchl protein complexes; B890 containing and B850-B800 containing complexes, and the other contained, in addition, B820-B800 containing complex. B890 containing complexes from the two types of chromatophores were spectrally similar, whereas B850-B800 containing complexes were not the same with respect to the location of absorption maxima and the content of B850.

The derivative binds actanoyl-CoA and palmityol-CoA with concomitant perturbation of the flavin chromophore, but the characterisitic spectrum of the reduced enzyme-enoyl-CoA complex is not observed. In addition, octanyol-CoA strongly protects the native enzyme against alkylation with iodoacetate.

The composite spheroids thus formed consist of external, thioguanine-resistant (TGr) and internal, thioguanine-sensitive cells. Cell sorting with a Becton Dickinson FACS II was used to determine the relative position of TGr cells and sensitivity to fluorescent drugs. After 2-4 days, the TGr cells are found internally as well as externally. The initial percentage of TGr cells varies from 1 to 50%, depending on the size of the single-cell inoculum, size of spheroids and frequency of addition of cells during a 24th period. Differential effects of drugs or radiation on external (cycling, oxic) vs internal (non-cycling, hypoxic) cells of composite spheroids can be assayed by simply plating cells trypsinized from spheroids into standard medium or medium with 2 mu g/ml 6-thioguanine, which allows growth of only TGr cells. For example, Adriamycin, which penetrates poorly into spheroids, is preferentially toxic to external cells, and causes a decrease in the percentage of TGr survivors. Irradiation of composite spheroids also causes preferential killing of external (oxic) TGr cells. However, AF-2, a nitrofuran which preferentially kills hypoxic cells, caused an increase in the 0/0 of TGr cells. This technique should prove useful in the evaluation of the preferential cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents, alone or in combination.",Immunology

Many nerves traverse the entire liver lobules and may end near the central vein. The guinea pig hepatocyte innervation seems to be uniformly adrenergic. Electron microscopy shows that the varicosities of these nerves mostly form closes contacts to the hepatocytes but also to other hepatic intralobular cells.

Thermoluminescence response curves were determined for the 200 degrees C and 260 degrees C and 260 degrees C glow peaks in LiF and for the 200 degrees C peak in Li2B4O7 when the dosemeters were exposed in the peak and plateau regions of the Bragg curve. TLD-700 appears to be suited for use in pion dosimetry since it is capable of measuring both total and high-LET dose by utilising the 200 and 260 degrees C peaks. TLD-100, TLD-600, and TLD-800 will not be useful because the neutrons emitted from pi- capture result in an enhanced dose to the thermoluminescence dosemeters via (n, alpha) reactions which cannot be extracted from the data.

The purpose of the study was to determine the relationship between running economy and distance running performance in highly trained and experienced distance runners of comparable ability. Oxygen uptake (Vo2) during steady-state and maximal aerobic power (Vo2max) were measured during treadmill running using the open-circuit method. Distance running performance was determined in a nationally prominent 10 km race; all subjects (12 males) placed among the top 19 finishers. The subjects averaged 32.1 min on the 10 km run, 71.7 ml.kg-1.min-1 for Vo2max, and 44.7, 50.3, and 55.9 ml.kg-1.min-1 for steady-state Vo2 at three running paces (241, 268, and 295 m.min-1). The relationship between Vo2max and distance running performance was r = -0.12 (p = 0.35). The relationship between steady-state Vo2 at 241, 268 and 295 m.min-1 and 10 km time were r = 0.83, 0.82, and 0.79 (p < 0.01), respectively. Within this elite cluster of finishers, 65.4% of the variation observed in race performance time on the 10 km run could be explained by variation in running economy. It was concluded that among highly trained and experienced runners of comparable ability and similar Vo2max, running economy accounts for a large and significant amount of the variation observed in performance on a 10 km race.",Immunology

Each protein fraction was further separated by gel electrophoresis, and profiles of 32P incorporation were evaluated in these pathophysiological conditions. 32P incorporation of the acidic phenol-soluble nonhistone chromatin protein became significantly suppressed in cerebral anoxia after 15 min, and there were decreases of 32P incorporation in protein with high molecular weight and increase in protein with low molecular weight on gel electrophoresis. With gerbil brain nuclei, 32P incorporation into the NaCl-soluble and HCl-soluble fraction was increased without significant decrease in the phenol-soluble fraction after an ischemic period of 3 h. However, further separation of the phenol-soluble fraction demonstrated decrease of 32P incorporation in protein with high molecular weight and increase in protein with low molecular weight.

We have investigated the effect of erythrocyte membrane preparations on the rate of polymerization and the solubility of deoxyhemoglobin S. The kinetics of polymerization was monitored by measuring changes in turbidity of hemoglobin S solutions as a function of time in a temperature-controlled cuvette. The solubility of deoxyhemoglobin S, an equilibrium measurement, was determined by measuring the hemoglobin concentration of the supernatant following centrifugation of the polymerized hemoglobin S solution. The solubility of deoxyhemoglobin S was unaffected by the presence of red cell membrane ghosts, inside-out red cell vesicles, or inside-out vesicles enriched in erythrocyte spectrin and actin (Bands 1, 2, and 5) in the hemoglobin solution. Furthermore, inside-out vesicles had no significant effect on kinetics of polymerization. The addition of erythrocyte membrane ghosts to the hemoglobin solution, in ratios approximating that of the intact red cell, increased the rate of polymerization up to 8-fold. However, when corrections were made for the excluded volume contributed by the membrane ghosts, the enhancement of the rate of polymerization was reduced to less than 3-fold.

Praziquantel (PZ) (10(-6) M), an antischistosomal drug, 60 mM K+ and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) induce a rapid contracture of the musculature in adult male S. mansoni. This event is accompanied, except for DNP, by an increased accumulation of 45Ca2+ in the parasite. K+-induced contractures had phasic and tonic components while DNP and PZ produced only tonic contracture of the parasites musculature. The Ca2+ antagonist, D-600 (10(-4) M) as well as La3+ (10 mM) and Co2+ (10 mM) prevented the 45Ca2+ accumulation produced by high K+. La3+ and Co2+ blocked the tension increasing effects of high K+; D-600 blocked only the tonic contractures. D-600 and Co2+ did not prevent the 45Ca2+ increase produced by PZ but La3+ did. D-600 did not block the PZ response but Co2+ and La3+ partially attenuated it. La3+ also partially attenuated the DNP response. Co2+ and D-600 prevented sustained contractures in response to DNP. Thus, although K+, PZ and DNP have the same final effect on the musculature of S. mansoni, it appears that their effects are not mediated by the same mechanisms.",Immunology

The authors described a lumbar spine fracture that is characterized on anteroposterior x-ray views by separation of the pedicular shadows. It is almost invariably associated with posterior interlaminar herniation of the cauda equina through a dorsal dural split, and anterolateral entrapment or amputation of the nerve root. The fracture is unstable and requires internal fixation and fusion at the time of neurolysis. Fractures meeting these criteria should be explored as soon as the patients' condition permits. Myelography is usually unnecessary and may be contraindicated in some cases. The postulated mechanism of injury is hyperextension with vertical impaction and rupture of the ring made up of the lamina, pedicle, and vertebral body. The ring is fractured in several places in a manner similar to that seen in ""Jefferson fracture"" of C-1. The special anatomical relationships of the thoracolumbar junction and the plane of the lumbar facets are also discussed.",Immunology

With a specially designed distraction apparatus and the 14C-antipyrine autoradiographic technique, the effect of distraction on spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) in cats was studied. Distraction was performed at L2-3 at a rate of 0.25 cm/10 min, and the spinal evoked response (SER) was monitored by stimulating the sciatic nerve and recording at T-13. The SCBF was assessed in five control animals, four animals in whom the SER was markedly altered by distraction, and five animals after the SER had been abolished and an additional 0.5 cm distraction applied. Control cats had gray- and white-matter flows of 44.5 +/- 1.4 (SEM) and 10.5 +/- 0.4 ml/100 gm/min, respectively. Distraction to the point of marked SER alteration caused a 50% loss of SCBF at and caudal to the distraction site. An additional 0.5 cm distraction produced total abolition of SCBF at the distraction site and for a considerable distance rostral and caudal to it. Thus, it is shown that spinal distraction causes cord ischemia similar to that seen with other types of spinal cord injury. In addition, distraction severe enough to cause loss of the SER has already produced severe cord ischemia.",Immunology
7438101,"A survey of transformation markers in differentiating epidermal cell lines in culture. Primary mouse epidermal cells underwent spontaneous malignant transformation in culture. TWelve malignant epidermal cell lines were established which produced squamous cell carcinomas in syngeneic hosts. These lines were used to define criteria for recognizing transformed epidermal cells in vitro. Growth in suspension in agar, agarose, or Methocel was minimal for 11 of the lines. All lines tested retained specific epidermal antigens (pemphigus, pemphigoid, keratin) by indirect  immunofluorescence, but keratin content was reduced when quantified by radioimmunoassay. Basal activity of ornithine decarboxylase and activity induced by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate were variable among lines. All malignant lines as well as normal epidermal cells grew well at reduced extracellular calcium concentrations. When the extracellular calcium was elevated, normal cells ceased proliferation, terminally differentiated, and sloughed from the culture dish, while malignant cells continued to proliferate although they expressed differentiative functions. These results indicate that malignant transformation in epidermis is associated with a fundamental alteration in the program of terminal differentiation which allows some cells to escape the proliferative block and cell death which accompanies differentiation in normal keratinocytes. This alteration should be useful to select for transformants during the process of carcinogenesis in vitro.",Immunology

Gamma-irradiated PVC tubes were resterilized with ethylene oxide and the 2-chlorethanol concentrations determined by gas chromatography. The 2-chlorethanol concentrations at the end of sterilization ranged from 240 to 436 ppm depending upon the composition of the tubes. After 4 d they ranged from < 5 to 280 ppm and after 21 d from < 5 to 218 ppm. For comparison were examined PVC tubes which were not gamma-irradiated but ethylene oxide sterilized only. We extracted < 5 to 23 ppm ethylene chlorohydrin from them. PVC tubes gas sterilized only and retaining 44 to 9300 ppm ethylene oxide were submerged in physiological NaCl solution for 2 h. The ethylene chlorohydrin concentrations formed by this procedure ranged from 43 to 75 ppm. After 4 d aeration before begin of extraction they decreased to < 5, 10 and 16 ppm. PVC tubes aerated for 5 or 7 d, containing at least 236 ppm ethylene chlorohydrin did not demonstrate any effect upon cultures of human fibroblasts.

The metabolism of alclofenac (4-allyloxy-3-chlorophenyl acetic acid) and its ability to induce destruction of cytochrome P-450 was studied in mouse hepatic microsomes obtained from control animals or animals pretreated with phenobarbitone (PB) or 3-methyl-cholanthrene (3-MC). No evidence was obtained for metabolism of alclofenac in control microsomes although in induced microsomes alclofenac was metabolised to both the dihydroxy  (DHA) and phenolic (4-hydroxy-3-chlorophenyl acetic acid: HCPA) metabolites. Significant destruction of cytochrome P-450 was observed when alclofenac was incubated with microsomes from mice pretreated with PB but not from untreated or 3-MC-treated mice. This destruction is dependent on the presence of a NADPH-regenerating system and in inhibited in the presence of SKF-525A, metyrapone, glutathione and cysteine. The stable metabolites DHA and HCPA caused no loss of cytochrome P-450 whereas the reactive intermediate, alclofenac epoxide, was a potent inducer of destruction in the absence of NADPH. These results suggest that destruction of cytochrome P-450 by alclofenac in vitro is mediated, at least in part, through the formation of a reactive epoxide metabolite.",Immunology

Lactose was added because it is known to increase intestinal calcium retention. When the amount of calcium absorbed was expressed as a function of calcium instilled in the loop, it became possible to describe absorption as the sum of a hyperbolic and a linear function, equivalent to a saturable and a nonsaturable process, respectively. The slope of the nonsaturable component was independent of prior calcium intake, while the maximum saturable flux (Jmax) decreased as calcium intake increased. Analysis of the duodenal content of the vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein (CaBP, Mr congruent to 10(4)) revealed a positive relation between Jmax and CaBP.

Isoproterenol (I) increased Q at all four doses studied. Ten-minute infusions of N and E (0.5 microgram x kg-1 x min-1) caused sustained decreases, and I caused sustained increases in Q. Autoregulatory escape was not observed. alpha-Adrenergic receptor blockade (phenoxybenzamine) attenuated the vasoconstrictor responses to N, but did not ""reverse"" the vasoconstrictor response to E (vasodilation). beta-adrenergic receptor blockade (propranolol) attenuated the vasodilator responses to I, but did not alter significantly the responses to E or N. These data indicate that in the monkey colonic circulation, alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation causes vasoconstriction and beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation causes vasodilation.",Immunology

Cytoplasmic and nuclear binding of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide was assessed in isolated rat kidney cortical tubules, enriched in distal (fraction A) or in proximal segments (fraction B). The concentration dependence of specific [3H]triamcinolone acetonide binding in cytoplasm was determined (range = 4.4 X 10(-10) to 2.1 X 10(-7) M) and analyzed by a least-squares curve-fitting method. A single, high-affinity binding class with a dissociation constant of 1 X 10(-8) M (25 degrees C) was obtained in both fractions A and B. Based on competition for the [3H]triamcinolone acetonide sites, the following sequence of affinities was obtained: triamcinolone acetonide = dexamethasone > progesterone = corticosterone > d-aldosterone > 17 beta-estradiol. These specificities imply that these sites are glucocorticoid receptors. Fraction B contained 1.6 times more cytosol sites for [3H]triamcinolone acetonide than fraction A (5.0 +/- 0.5 X 10(-13) vs. 3.0 +/- 0.5 X 10(-13) mol/mg protein). In the presence of a onefold excess of d-aldosterone specific cytoplasmic binding of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide was 1.4-fold greater in fraction B than in fraction A, and specific nuclear binding was 1.3-fold greater in fraction B than in fraction A (5.1 +/- 0.6 X 10(-13) vs 4.0 +/- 0.5 X 10(-13) mol/mg DNA). These results and the measured lengths of proximal and distal tubules yielded estimates of a higher proximal content (three- to sixfold) compared to distal content of glucocorticoid receptors.",Immunology
7457602,"Renal function during reflexly activated catecholamine flow through an adrenorenal rete. Reflex vasoconstriction that occurs in the kidney of the dog can be the result of either of two mechanisms. The first is by activation of the renal sympathetic nerves and the second by reflex activation of catecholamine flow through an adrenorenal rete. Both reflex mechanisms can be activated by transient hypotension caused by experimentally induced atrial fibrillation in the sodium-replete pentobarbital-anesthetized dog. This study was undertaken to measure and compare the magnitude of changes in renal function that occur when these reflex mechanisms are activated and to evaluate the possible role of intrarenal angiotensin II in these two reflex effects. Reflex activation of catecholamine flow through an adrenorenal rete in intact or denervated kidneys produced a 26 +/- 3% decrease in renal plasma flow, a 23 +/- 4% decrease in glomerular filtration rate, a 58 +/- 7% decrease in urinary sodium excretion, and a 4 +/- 1% increase in filtration fraction, but no change in the fractional distribution of intrarenal blood flow. Changes of a similar direction and magnitude were seen in the same animals during reflex activation of the renal sympathetic nerves in the kidneys with intact or ligated adrenorenal rete. The same studies were performed after the intrarenal action of angiotensin II was blocked with [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II and similar responses were seen. Both of these reflexes appear to be important mechanisms by which the kidney can maintain vascular volume, and neither depends on intrarenal angiotensin II activity.",Immunology
7457518,"Maternal and cord blood complement activity: relationship to premature rupture of the membranes. Human complement levels are known to reflect the presence of clinical infection, with low levels indicative of increased utilization in the body's immune response. Premature rupture of the membranes (PRM) is associated with an increased maternal-fetal infectious morbidity, yet histopathologic and bacteriologic parameters often do not reflect this. In this prospective study maternal and cord serum total hemolytic complement activity (CH50) was measured in 102 patients without evidence of infection, with and without PRM, to determine if there exists within the maternal-fetal unit an immunologic response to this event. It was found that maternal serum CH50, regardless of length of gestation, is similar to that of the nonpregnant adult population, except in cases of PRM greater than 12 hours in which it is significantly lower. The CH50 in term newborn infants was significantly lower than that of matched maternal samples and dropped with decreasing gestational age. CH50 in cord serum from babies of mothers with PRM failed to show a significant decrease when compared to those of mothers without PRM.",Immunology

Sequential influenza A/Texas/77 (H3N2) and A/USSR/77 (H1N1) epidemics occurred during the winter of 1977-1978 in two populations under viral surveillance for influenza. In college students who reported to the Vanderbilt student health service, roughly equivalent amounts of typical influenzal disease were documented by virus isolation and total health service visits with both strains. However, considering that the college population was fully susceptible to the first introduction of H1N1 virus in 20 years and partially immune to H3N2 viruses through repeated exposure, A/USSR appeared to be a relatively less pathogenic strain. Stronger proof of this was seen in a closely monitored group of 200 largely seronegative infants and young children less than 4 years of age enrolled in an experimental vaccine clinic. In this young population, A/USSR caused no recognizable illness and A/Texas caused typical febrile respiratory disease. Thus, two influenza strains circulating in close temporal association differed in virulence when observed in carefully monitored susceptible populations.",Immunology
7457382,"Inhalation exposure of cadmium workers: effects of respirator usage. The objective of this study was to determine the average reduction in inhalation exposures produced by intermittent use of filter cartridge respirators by cadmium workers. Inhalation exposure was estimated by measuring the cadmium concentration inside the respirator while it was worn or hanging around the worker's neck. Air concentrations of cadmium were measured simultaneously inside the respirator and at the worker's lapel with a dual sampling system. Each of nine workers were measured on three consecutive days for a full work shift. The average inhalation exposures ranged from 3 to 67 micrograms/m3 while the TWA lapel concentrations ranged from 19 to 3600 micrograms/m3; respirator use produced a substantial reduction in inhalation exposures when lapel concentrations were above 100 micrograms/m3. On the average, the inhalation exposure was 26% of the lapel concentration, but the effective protection varied widely between individuals and from day to day. If used cautiously, this relationship may be useful for estimating the approximate average inhalation exposure of a group of workers routinely using half mask respirators.",Immunology

Earlier histological, histochemical, biochemical and autoradiographic studies revealed a marked difference in the morphology and biology of placental villi dependence upon their localization within the materno-fetal circulation units (placentones). The quantitative differences demonstrated characterize the villi in the centres of the circulation units as morphologically and functionally less differentiated than the villi in the periphery. In the present study it should be scrutinized whether these differences can also be proven on the ultramicroscopic level. Small and large villi from both regions (centre and periphery) were studied. Two well-defined syncytial areas, namely syncytium directly overlying a fetal vessel and syncytium over a Langhans cell were studied separately. The following structures were chosen for study and counted by the ""grid"" method. Microvilli, rough endoplasmic reticulum with parallel channels, vesicular rough endoplasmic reticulum, and the number mitochondria. The ultrastructural studies support the earlier histological, enzyme-histochemical, biochemical and autoradiographic findings, which suggested that the villi in the periphery of the placentones have a higher degree of differentiation (maturation) than those in the centre.

In the case of infusion of Fenoterol alone measurements by the thermo-dye-technique showed massive shifts of lung fluids from the intravascular to the extravascular space corresponding to interstitial edema. The addition of Verapamil induced no further changes. The intrapulmonary haemodynamical overload by increased cardiac output and pulmonary arterial pressure which we measured after infusion of Fenoterol must be regarded as the main cause of the shifts in fluid volumes.

The electron transfer reactions of membrane-bound monomeric cytochrome f from Brassica komatosuna (Brassica rapa L. var. perviridis Bailey) with hexacyanoferrate (II)-(III) have been studied as a function of pH, ionic strength and temperature. The second-order rate constant for the oxidation of cytochrome f by Fe(CN)6(3-) at pH 7.0, mu 0.1 M, and 20 degrees C is 1.7 X 10(5) M-1 X S-1, which is similar to the value of oligomeric cytochrome f from parsley. The activation parameters obtained were delta H not equal to = -0.87 kcal/mol and delta S not equal to - -38 cal/mol x deg. Respective rat constant and activation parameters obtained for the reduction of cytochrome f by Fe(CN)6(4-) were k = 1.7 X 10(4) M-1 x S-1, delta H not equal to = +6.7 kcal/mol, and delta S not equal to -16 cal/mol x deg. Both the rate constants for the oxidation and the reduction of cytochrome f markedly decreased with increasing ionic strength. The results indicate that the oxidation and the reduction take place at a positively charged site on the cytochrome f surface, and electrostatic interactions are important for these reactions. The participation of protons and specific amino acid residues in electron transfer reactions of cytochrome f is implied from the pH results. Alkaline isomerization of ferricytochrome f was not observed. The midpoint potential of cytochrome f has a constant value of 360 mV between pH 5.0-8.9, and decreases by about 55 mV per pH unit above 8.9.

There was, however, a significant difference between the mean values of the groups (p < 0,01). Serum creatinine, the presence or absence of ischemic heart disease, and/or chronic pulmonary heart disease were significantly different (both p < 0,025) between toxic and non-toxic groups. It is concluded that a decision on digitalis toxicity should be made by a synopsis of the influencing factors in the individual case. Dosage, serum creatinine and cardiac status seem to be the most important factors to be taken into account. Lack of agreement between SDC and digoxin effects could be demonstrated in differences in ""T 1/2"" between SDC and the normalisation of prolonged PQ-time after digoxin withdrawal.

In six control subjects and five patients with cirrhosis of the liver urea synthesis was studied during continuous infusion for six to 24 hours of about 3 mmol alpha-amino nitrogen/h X kg body weight. The urea synthesis rate was calculated in intervals of two hours as urinary excretion with correction for accumulation in the total body water and for hydrolysis of urea in the gut. The peripheral venous plasma alpha-amino nitrogen concentration increased from 3 to about 14 mmol/l and the urea nitrogen synthesis rate from 25 to about 215 mmol/h. In all cases the urea synthesis rate rose linearly with the alpha-amino concentration throughout the examined range. The slope of this linear relationship is an expression of the hepatic conversion of alpha-amino nitrogen to urea nitrogen ('functional hepatic nitrogen clearance'). The functional hepatic nitrogen clearance was 22.4 l/h in control subjects and 13.7 1/h (P < 0.025) in the patients with cirrhosis. It was correlated with quantitative measures of the liver function (the galactose elimination capacity, r = 0.84, and the clearance of antipyrine, 4 = 0.80).

Two treated monkeys did not have shortened menstrual cycles, although a luteolytic effect on plasma progesterone was evident. One monkey with a late ovulation (confirmed by endocrine parameters and laparoscopic observation) was treated with the same regimen in the early luteal phase; this also resulted in a decline in plasma progesterone and a shortened luteal phase (11 days). Treatment with the estrogen or the CB-154 component alone had no effect on menstrual cycle length or plasma progesterone levels. Similarly, treatment with CB-154 throughout the luteal phase had no effect on luteal function. An abbreviated treatment consisting of 1 day of estrogen and 1 day of CB-154 administration gave some indication of a luteolytic effect. None of these treatments produced detectable side effects. These studies have demonstrated a synergism of estrogen and CB-154 in the induction of luteolysis in cynomolgus monkeys.

The quantitative relationship between a given decrease in O2 tension (Po2) and the degree of depression of contractile function is difficult to define in intact myocardial tissues because of uncertainty in estimation of diffusion limitations. We therefore have studied the effects of hypoxia on contractility in a system with minimal series diffusion barriers, consisting of single cells within spontaneously contracting monolayers cultured from 10-day-old chick embryo ventricles. Reversible decreases in amplitude and velocity of cell wall motion occurred over a 3- to 4-min period when perfusate Po2 was less than 12 mmHg, and a maximum depression to about 30% of control levels occurred at Po2 values less than 4 mmHg. On reoxygenation, recovery of amplitude and velocity of contraction occurred in less than 15 s. Inhibition of glycolysis with 0.1 mM iodoacetate resulted in a more marked decrease in contraction amplitude and a significant slowing of beating rate during hypoxia. In addition, the critical Po2 at which contractile function became impaired was increased to about 16 mmHg. Thus, high-energy phosphates derived from anaerobic glycolysis appear to be able to support a reduced level of contractility during brief periods of hypoxia in these cultured heart cells.",Immunology
7435388,"Continuous fractionated electrical activity after stimulation of the ventricles during the vulnerable period: evidence for local reentry. Ventricular multiple extrasystoles and fibrillation were induced in open chest dogs by the delivery of either a single electrical pulse or a train of pulses to the right ventricle during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle. Bipolar epicardial electrodes delivered current while bipolar plunge electrodes recorded the activation complexes at various distances from the stimulation site. At stimulus intensities below the threshold for multiple ventricular responses, the electrograms recorded from muscle adjacent to the stimulation site showed fragmented activation complexes that lasted considerably longer than the control complexes. At stimulus intensities that evoked multiple ventricular extrasystoles or fibrillation, the fragmented electrical activity became continuous and bridged the diastolic interval between successive ectopic complexes. The continuous fractionated electrical activity that preceded the appearance of multiple extrasystoles and fibrillation was recorded only from electrodes placed within a few millimeters of the stimulating electrodes and could be evoked only by stimulation during the vulnerable period. Disappearance of the fractionated local electrical activity during a run of extrasystoles was followed immediately by the resumption of a normal rhythm. In addition, the fractionated continuous electrical activity that appeared after delivery of a single stimulus during the vulnerable period could be abolished by the delivery of a second stimulus during the protective zone. The presence of continuous local electrical activity before the development of multiple extrasystoles and fibrillation provides strong evidence that the ventricular fibrillation threshold technique operates by producing local reentrant activity.",Immunology

After withdrawal the animals pretreated for 3 weeks showed tolerance to the lethal effect of ethanol as indicated by significantly prolonged survival and higher cerebrospinal fluid ethanol level at death after an oral test dose of 15 g/kg. The tolerance disappeared within a week. Metabolic tolerance, although present, did not prolong the survival of the animals, and the results suggest involvement of cellular tolerance in the central nervous system.",Immunology

Saturated and unsaturated hyaluronate oligosaccharides were prepared from human umbilical cord hyaluronic acid by partial digestion with bovine testicular and Streptomyces hyaluronidase, respectively. After treatment with Streptomyces hyaluronidase, the distribution of degradation products from these oligosaccharides was determined. Octasaccharides, either saturated or unsaturated, were substrates of the minimum size. Tetra- and hexasaccharides were not degraded further and remained as final products. This indicates that at least four succeeding N-acetylhyalobiuronosyl residues were required for this enzymatic degradation. Since unsaturated oligosaccharides were more susceptible to this enzyme than saturated ones of the same polymerization degree, and inner glucosaminidic linkages were cleaved in preference to those at the outermost sites, some groups adjacent to this segment seemed to influence the susceptibility of the oligosaccharide to this enzyme.",Immunology

7448869,"Role of ATP in binding and migration of 40S ribosomal subunits. Two assays have been devised to demonstrate ATP-dependent migration of 40S ribosomal subunits on messenger RNA. The first is a two-step runoff assay. Reovirus mRNA was initially loaded with 40S subunits by incubation with wheat germ ribosomes in the presence of the antibiotic edeine. During the second phase of the incubation, in which further attachment of ribosomes was inhibited, the preformed complexes were shown to dissociate (presumably by runoff) only if ATP was included in the reaction. A more direct demonstration of ATP-dependent migration of 40S subunits was carried out using 3' end-labeled brome mosaic virus mRNA. In the presence of edeine and ATP, 40S ribosomal subunits were shown to advance all the way to the 3' end of the message, as shown by protection of the labeled 3'-proximal segment against nuclease digestion. Depletion of ATP by the addition of hexokinase prevented this migration. A variety of observations has raised the possibility that attachment of eucaryotic ribosomes to messenger RNA proceeds via a ""scanning mechanism."" The hypothesis is that a 40S subunit binds initially at or near the 5' terminus of the message and subsequently migrates toward the interior, stopping when it encounters the first AUG triplet. If migration of 40S subunits requires ATP, as the present studies suggest, the scanning mechanism predicts that in a system depleted of ATP a single 40S ribosome should be trapped near the 5' terminus of the message--upstream of the AUG initiator codon. This prediction was confirmed by analyzing binding of wheat germ ribosomes to a synthetic ribopolymer in which the 5'-proximal region (lacking AUG codons) and the AUG-containing segment near the 3' end of the molecule were differentially labeled.",Immunology
7448790,"Role of cytoplasmic lipids in altering diphenylhexatriene fluorescence polarization in malignant cells. Prior studies of fluorescence anisotropy (polarization) with diphenylhexatriene in normal and malignant cell populations have shown differences which have been attributed to an altered membrane lipid composition in cancer. We studied fresh tumor cells from patients with diverse lymphoid neoplasms and found a discrete range of whole-cell fluorescence polarization values (P values) for each type of neoplasm. Following cell fractionation, however, the P values of isolated plasma membranes from malignant cells did not differ significantly from the values obtained with normal donor lymphocytes. Therefore, the altered whole-cell fluorescence polarization measurements in malignant cells are not likely to be due to gross lipid changes in the plasma membrane. Histochemical staining and cell fractionation revealed the presence of cytoplasmic lipid accumulations, and these had extremely low P values, which could account for the low P values of malignant cells. Complementary studies of lymphoid cell lines showed whole-cell fluorescence polarization measurements to be extremely sensitive to exogenous lipid supplements, but membrane values remained stable. We conclude that alterations in membrane lipid fluidity, as measured by the diphenylhexatriene probe, are not consistently found in lymphoid neoplasms and hence cannot presently be invoked to account for the malignant behavior of these cells. However, intracellular neutral lipid accumulation appears to be a common feature of the lymphoid neoplasm. The lipid alterations described could be characteristic of cell immaturity or proliferation rather than malignancy; nevertheless, they may convey unappreciated biological consequences.",Immunology

7448340,"Disposition kinetics of disopyramide in patients with renal insufficiency. The pharmacokinetics of an intravenous injection of disopyramide was studied in five normal subjects and six patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. The elimination rate constant (beta) was related to the endogenous creatinine clearance (Clcr). However, a decrease in beta was not observed until the Clcr was reduced below 40 ml min-1. Below 40 ml min-1 a linear relationship existed between beta and Clcr. Similarly, the plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2 beta) showed a significant increase when the Clcr was less than 30 ml min-1. Hence, dosage modification for disopyramide is necessary only when renal function is severely impaired. Overall, the apparent volume of distribution in patients with renal insufficiency was reduced to two-thirds of that in normal subjects. Therefore, in patients with Clcr less than 40 ml min-1 both the loading and maintenance dose of disopyramide should be reduced.",Immunology

The time-course effect of a single dose (75 mg/kg i.p.) of phenobarbital (PB) and that of prolonged PB treatment (75 mg/kg daily i.p., for 1 to 5 days) on the hepatic excretory and microsomal enzyme functions have been studied in rats. PB given in a single dose resulted in hypercholeresis 6 hr, an increase in the biliary excretion rate of bromcresol green and in hepatic cytochrome P-45 concentration 12 hr, and shortening of hexobarbital sleeping time 24 hr after the administration. All these changes, except the hypercholeresis, became gradually more apparent following the repeated daily administration of PB. Regression of the changes was faster in biliary excretory function than in microsomal function. Biliary flow and biliary output of bromcresol green returned to the control level at 72 hr after a single dose of PB or at 5 days after the cessation of a 5-day PB treatment, whereas enzyme induction was still apparent at those times. These results indicate that no close correlation in time exists between PB produced hepatic microsomal enzyme induction and the stimulatory effect of PB on biliary excretion.",Immunology

The effect of prednisolone and rifampin, alone and in combination, on the biodisposition of isoniazid in slow and rapid inactivators of isoniazid was investigated. In one investigation, we made serial determinations of plasma isoniazid concentrations up to 8 h and of isoniazid and acetylisoniazid in excreted urine up to 8.5 h in patients receiving isoniazid alone on one occasion and isoniazid plus prednisolone or isoniazid plus rifampin on another. Prednisolone caused a significant decrease in the plasma isoniazid concentrations in both slow and rapid inactivators. It also enhanced the renal clearance of isoniazid in both slow and rapid inactivators and increased the rate of acetylation of isoniazid in slow inactivators only. Rifampin had no effect on the biodisposition of isoniazid in either slow or rapid inactivators. In a second investigation, one group of slow and rapid inactivators received isoniazid and rifampin, and a different group received prednisolone, in addition. Plasma isoniazid concentrations in slow inactivators receiving prednisolone were significantly lower than in those who received isoniazid and rifampin only. In rapid inactivators, plasma isoniazid concentrations were similar in the two groups of patients, suggesting that concomitant administration of rifampin had considerably modified the prednisolone effect on the biodisposition of isoniazid in these patients.",Immunology

Intracranial pressure (ICP), arterial blood pressure (BP) and the calculated cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were investigated under standard conditions in 14 patients with severe brain injury. The influence of etomidate 0.3 mg/kg in comparison with thiopentone 6.0 mg/mg was evaluated both in patients with primarily elevated ICP (group I) and with an increase of ICP produced by nitrous oxide in oxygen (group II). In both groups of patients a marked ICP reduction (42%/26%) was produced by etomidate as well as by thiopentone. Whereas the reduction of CPP caused by thiopentone was enhanced by a moderate fall in BP, no influence on either BP or CPP was observed with etomidate. A regular fall in BP by about 10-15% was observed under nitrous oxide in oxygen alone, subsequently reducing the CPP by about 25%. These results emphasize the importance of the actions and interactions of different combinations of anesthetics in patients with acute brain injury in the prevention of further brain ischaemia. We believe that etomidate like thiopentone has brain protective properties in patients with cerebral hypoxia and must therefore be considered as an important therapeutic agent in such patients.",Immunology

We investigated pulmonary mechanics in 25 patients, 9 to 55 years of age, with a variety of generalised neuromuscular diseases and variable degrees of respiratory muscle weakness. The average degree of inspiratory muscle force was 39.2% (range 8-83%) of predicted. The lung volume restriction far exceeded that expected for the degree of muscle weakness: the observed decrement in respiratory muscle force should, theoretically, decrease vital capacity to 78% of its control value, while the mean VC in our patients was only 50% of predicted. Analysis of lung pressure-volume curves indicated that the two principal causes of the disproportionate loss of lung volume were a reduction in lung distensibility probably caused by widespread microatelectasis, and a decrease in the outward pull of the chest wall. Because it reflects both direct (loss of distending pressure) and secondary (alterations in the elastic properties of the lungs and chest wall) effects of respiratory muscle weakness on lung function, we conclude that, in these patients, the vital capacity remains the most useful measurement to follow evolution of the disease process or response to treatment.",Immunology

Mutants of Candida lipolytica that were unable to grow on acetate but able to utilize succinate or glycerol as a sole carbon source were isolated. Amongst the mutants isolated, one strain (Icl-) was specifically deficient in isocitrate lyase activity, whereas another strain (Acos-) was deficient in acetyl coenzyme A synthetase activity. Since the Icl- mutant could not grow either on n-alkane or its derivatives, such as fatty acid and long-chain dicarboxylic acid, any anaplerotic route other than the glyoxylate pathway was inconceivable as far as growth on these carbon sources was concerned. Acetyl coenzyme A is most likely a metabolic inducer of isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, because the Acos- mutant was characterized by the least susceptibility to induction of these enzymes by acetate. The structural gene for isocitrate lyase was most probably impaired in the Icl- mutant, since revertants (Icl-) produced thermolabile isocitrate lyase.

Trans-vascular escape rates of albumin (TERa) and IgG (TERg) were determined in the cirrhotic patients from the disappearance of simultaneously intravenously injected 131I-labelled serum albumin and 124I-labelled IgG. Peritoneal space to plasma appearance times ranged 0.1-3.3 h, and the appearance times of albumin and IgG were almost identical. In patients with cirrhosis FPRRa and FPRRg were on average 1.27 and 1.21% of intraperitoneal protein masses returning to plasma per hour, respectively. Mean FPRRg/FPRRa ratio was 0.95 and this value was not significantly different from unity, but significantly higher (P < 0.001) than the ratio between the free diffusion coefficients of IgG and albumin (0.06). The calculated ascitic fluid flow rate was on average 61 ml/h. TERa and TERg were on average 9.6 and 8.6% of intravascular protein masses per hour, mean TERg/TERa ratio was 0.95. Peritoneal space to plasma protein flux averaged 0.4% of the intravascular protein mass per hour.

Reduction of growth rate and increase of survival time by administration of physiological doses of branched-chain amino acids. The continuous administration of physiological doses of the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine (Leu-Ile-Val) to Yoshida sarcoma-bearing rats caused a significant increase in the survival time by 32% and a significant reduction of tumor size after 3 weeks of growth by 33%. The shift of the nitrogen balance to negative values during the cachectic stage was delayed but not prevented. On the average, less nitrogen (-47 mg/day) were lost by Leu-Ile-Val treated rats compared with untreated tumor-bearing animals (-91 mg N/day). It appeared that Leu-Ile-Val increased the synthesis of carcass proteins, while it left the proteolysis rate unchanged, since the excretion of urea and creatinine was unaffected by these amino acids. The daily excretion of alpha-ketoglutarate, which is correlated with tumor size during the early stage of growth, was decreased during the first 2 weeks by Leu-Ile-Val, but remained for a longer period on a high level than in untreated tumor bearers.

Blood samples were drawn before and after 6 weeks on each estrogen. Serum phospholipids, cholesterol and triglycerides were assessed. Preparative ultracentrifugation with the isolation of the very low density (VLDL; d < 1.006 g/ml); the low density (LDL; d = 1.006-1.063 g/ml) and the high density lipoprotein (HDL; d > 1.063 g/ml) fraction was carried out. In the three lipoprotein fractions, phospholipid, total cholesterol, free cholesterol and triglycerides were determined. An oral glucose tolerance test with concomitant plasma insulin determination was performed. In the present study EE caused an increase in serum total and LDL triglycerides while there was a reduction of triglycerides in serum as well as in VLDL and LDL when E2V ws administered. There was a positive correlation between plasma insulin values during oral glucose tolerance test and serum and VLDL triglycerides when E2V was administered. This finding supports earlier studies indicating that insulin (or rather the insulin-glucagon relationship) influences the hepatic triglyceride production rate. Both EE and E2V increased HDL cholesterol, but E2V did not induce a concomitant increase in serum triglycerides which would suggest a more physiological effect from the latter compound since fertile females have lower serum triglycerides and higher HDL cholesterol levels than males of corresponding age.

Although the Wells and Dezen review made many valuable points about family therapy outcome research, their handling of the various included studies appeared uneven. To test this impression, a content analysis was performed on the ""favorableness"" or ""positiveness"" of the statements made by Wells and Dezen about the studies they reviewed. The degree of positiveness was compared across studies with the Design Quality and with the level of sophistication of these studies. All of the statistical correlations were negative--half of them significantly so--a result completely opposite to what would be expected. We conclude that Wells and Dezen tended to give undue praise to many uncontrolled studies and inordinate criticism to more sophisticated and better-designed research. In addition, other inconsistencies in the evaluation of studies were noted. Further, specific studies were presented in a distorted and inacurate manner, and without proper attention to statistical principles. In sum, it appears that Wells and Dezen (a) have not been sufficiently careful in their analysis of the reviewed research, and (b) have, through their evaluative remarks, provided a biased review which obscures many important comparisons within this field.",Immunology

Human effusion macrophages isolated from the pleural or ascitic effusions of 14 patients with malignant or benign disease usually inhibited methyl-3H-thymidine incorporation in an adherent human tumour cell line (NHIK 3025) when the macrophages were challenged with target cells immediately after isolation. The cytostatic activity disappeared when the macrophages were cultured for 18 hours in vitro before target cell challenge. The presence of endotoxin (LPS) or Corynebacterium parvum (Cp) during the macrophage-target cell interaction induced a small enhancement of the macrophage-mediated cytostatic activity. Preincubation of macrophages with Cp or Cp-induced lymphokine supernatants for 2-18 hours before target cell challenge induced increased cytostatic activity in the macrophage cultures. Adherent (NHIK 3025) or non-adherent (K-562) human tumour cells prelabelled with methyl-3H-thymidine, when added to freshly isolated macrophages, were lysed in a slowly progressive manner. The cytolytic activity to K-562 cells was enhanced by increasing macrophage density in the cultures, and by incubating the macrophages for 2 hours with lymphokine supernatants before target cell challenge.

The study was mainly focused on its mechanism; the role of the granulocytes, Kupffer cells, platelets and precipitated fibrin. It was revealed that Kupffer cells were severely damaged by the first, preparative injection and the most conspicuous finding after the second, provocative injection was marked granulocytic infiltration followed by massive hepatic cell necrosis. The infiltrating granulocytes sticked to the endothelium, degenerated Kupffer cells, or other granulocytes and, often aggregated around precipitated fibrin. The erythrocytes in the sinusoid also showed aggregation after the provocative injection of the endotoxin, which was, however, rather loose and easily washed out from the sinusoid by perfusion.

Beta-thalassemia trait is a frequent cause of microcytic anemia in Mediterranean children. Because striking age-related changes occur in hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume during childhood, we assessed developmental hematologic characteristics of 132 patients less than or equal to 18 years of age with beta-thalassemia trait. Thirty-nine kindred were studied to examine intrafamilial correlations of hematologic abnormalities. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait demonstrated Hgb values about 2 gm/dl below normal standards, with a progressive rise with age paralleling normal trends. Thalassemic MCV values showed a far greater deviation from normal than Hgb levels. In contrast to normal developmental trends which show a sharp increase in the first five years of life, the MCV in thalassemia trait showed no age-related increase prior to adolescence. No age-related changes in hemoglobin A2 levels were noted. Kindred studies demonstrate a correlation of the degree of anemia, microcytosis, and elevated hemoglobin A2 levels in affected family members (r = 0.318 P < 0.004, r = 0.525 P < 0.001, r = 0.416 P < 0.0015, respectively). Our findings support the use of electronically determined MCV values as an initial screening procedure for children with beta-thalassemia trait.

Enzymic determinations of intracellular concentrations of methylglyoxal-bis(guanylhydrazone), an anticancer drug which inhibits the synthesis of the polyamines spermidine and spermine, in cultured tumor cells revealed that the drug was remarkably effectively concentrated inside the cell. A concentration gradient across the cell membrane as great as 500--1000-fold was formed in cells exposed to the drug for 1-2 days. An exposure of cultured Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells to increasing concentrations of the drug indicated that the cells could tolerate intracellular concentrations up to 1 mM with only slight changes in their proliferation rate. Micromolar concentrations of spermidine or spermine, but not putrescine, effectively blocked the uptake of methylglyoxal-bis(guanylhydrazone) and reduced the intracellular concentration of the drug below the levels required for growth inhibition. Analysis of cellular polyamine contents in Ehrlich ascites cells exposed to rising concentrations of methylglyoxal-bis(guanylhydrazone) gave little support to the view that the drug-induced growth inhibition was solely produced by an intracellular polyamine deprivation. Not only was the uptake of the drug inhibited in the presence of spermidine and spermine, but it was likewise washed out by polyamines from the cells that had been previously exposed to the drug and then transferred into drug-free medium in the presence of polyamines. For the inhibition of methylglyoxal-bis(guanylhydrazone) uptake by amines, three or more amino/imino groups were apparently required, since low concentrations of aliphatic diamines were either without any effect (short-chain diamines) or only marginally prevented (long-chain diamines) the uptake of the drug.

For control, the corresponding parameters were studied in patients with an infectious bacterial disease (erysipelas) and in healthy persons. A decrease in the activity of intracellular leukocytic enzymes, acidic and alkaline phosphatases, was found to be one of the causes of deficient phagocytosis (decreased phagocytic activity and the decreased index of phagocytosis completion in neutrophils).",Immunology

Portal hypertension has been considered a pathogenetic factor in the onset of renal haemodynamic alterations in patients with cirrhosis. This hypothesis is based on experimental evidence, whereas the clinical data are few and contradictory. Mean and cortical renal blood flows were studied in 16 patients with liver cirrhosis before and 20-40 days after a portal-systemic shunt performed by different techniques: nine patients had a non-selective shunt and seven a selective shunt (distal splenorenal according to Warren). Despite a decrease in portal pressure, mean and cortical renal blood flows did not change significantly after surgery, and there was no significant correlation between decrease in portal pressure and modification of renal blood flow. It is concluded that portal hypertension is not a pathogenetic factor in renal hypoperfusion in cirrhosis.",Immunology

An attempt was made to identify erythrocyte cell surface antigens associated with the major histocompatibility complex in the turkey. Two turkey lines, A and B, from the University of Minnesota, putatively homozygous for different major histocompatibility complex alleles, were used for this study. A total of 79 birds were immunized either by skin grafting or by injection of homogenized skin preparation in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Antisera produced with skin grafts and homogenized skin inoculated intramuscularly both contained red cell agglutinins of low titer. Because agglutination reactions were weak, no sera were suitable for use as line-specific typing fluids. Thus, we were unable to demonstrate that turkey erythrocytes contain serologically detectable major histocompatibility antigens corresponding to the B major histocompatibility system in the chicken or the H-2 system in mice. Rather, the turkey major histocompatibility complex is more like that in rabbits, dogs, monkeys and humans.",Immunology

We retrospectively analyzed the role of the dose level of CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil) in postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and in chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. There was a clear dose-response effect, indicating that CMF was useful only when given in a full or nearly full dose (greater than or equal to 85 per cent of the planned dose). Those given adjuvant therapy with 12 cycles of CMF at this dose level had a five-year relapse-free survival of 77 per cent, as compared with 45 per cent of patients treated only with radical mastectomy (P = 0.0001). In contrast, a subgroup receiving less than 65 per cent of the planned dose had a five-year survival without relapses of 48 per cent and a five-year survival with relapses of 67 per cent. These results are similar to those observed in a control group. With each dose level, the results at five years were influenced by the number of axillary lymph nodes involved but not by menopausal status.

The physiological significance of coronary obstructions of intermediate severity are difficult to assess from the angiogram alone. The hemodynamic significance of clinical coronary stenoses can be readily assessed, however, with a miniaturized Doppler probe developed at The University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics to measure phasic coronary velocity. No dissection of the coronary vessel is required. The probe is held in place over the coronary vessel with a small suction cup. Reactive hyperemia responses obtained following a 20 second occlusion clearly demonstrate the hemodynamic significance of a coronary stenosis. We have employed this approach in 64 patients with coronary artery disease. In 12 (19%) in whom the degree of stenosis of the vessel was equivocal (diameter narrowing 25% to 70%), the use of the Doppler probe and a 20 second reactive hyperemia curve allowed accurate and immediate assessment of the need for a bypass. Five of these equivocal lesions did not produce any alterations in coronary reserve and, accordingly, the vessels were not bypassed. In seven of them, the reactive hyperemia response was markedly depressed and as a result the vessel in question was bypassed. Thus measurements of coronary reactive hyperemia in vessels with obstruction of intermediate severity can influence the operative plan by assessing the physiological significance of the obstruction.",Immunology

Familiarity with replacement of the mitral valve (MVR) with prosthetic and tissue valves has dimmed awareness of the usefulness of open mitral commissurotomy (OMC). This is a review of a 10 year experience ending in December, 1978, of 222 consecutive patients operated upon with a clinical diagnosis of pure mitral stenosis. MVR was necessary in 25 patients (11.3%), primarily because of severe deformity of valvular and subvalvular structures. No closed commissurotomies were performed, as that operation is now considered passé. Of the 197 patients undergoing OMC, 12 had additional cardiac procedures. Of the three patients who died (1.52%), two were operated upon on an emergency basis because of rapidly progressive cardiac failure. Follow-up data were obtained on 191 (97%) of the 197 OMC patients. There were 18 late deaths, of which 14 were related to cardiac disease. Following OMC, 76% (146) of the patients had improved by at least one New York Heart Association class. Fourteen (7%) of the 191 OMC patients had subsequent MVR at times varying from 2 to 92 months after OMC (mean 41.6 months). Ten-year survival for the 197 OMC patients was 81%. This clinical experience emphasizes that open commissurotomy rather than valve replacement is the best initial treatment for most patients with mitral stenosis.",Immunology

In view of previous conflicting reports, the distribution of a water overload was investigated in 6 healthy volunteers. The fall in serum sodium was predictable from prior measurement of total body water (tritium) confirming that the induced hyponatraemia was dilutional. Using a standard intravenous fluid regimen, a prospective study for 6 days on 50 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery established a confidence band for change in serum sodium concentration. This band not only enables precise prediction of whether observed sodium values in patients are ""normal' for that point in their postoperative course, but also demonstrates that changes are more prolonged than was at first thought. Their dilutional nature following uncomplicated surgery is supported by linear relationships between serum osmolality and serum sodium (s-Osm = 1.86 [s-Na+] + 18:74; (P < 0.001) and between observed and calculated osmolality (Obs-Osm = 0.97 [Calc-Osm] + 15.11; P < 0.001). More detailed investigation of 14 patients by isotope dilution provided independent evidence of dilutional change. This conclusion is additionally supported by lesser changes in patients on a more restricted fluid regimen. As a practical confirmation of the utility of this approach, departures from the simple dilutional relationships were observed in 7 critically ill patients whose postoperative course was complicated. In this group osmolal ""gags' of 20-50 mosmol/kg were identified. Current standard postoperative fluid regimens cause dilutional changes; these are predictable and provide a yardstick for use in management of both the healthy and the ill surgical patient.",Immunology

Reaggregation of dissociated spinal cord and cerebral cells from embryonic mice and development of glioneuronal aggregates were studied during cultivation in collagen wells. Over 20 hours of cultivation the suspended cells formed glioneuronal aggregates which then adhered to the collagen substrate, forming random or organized (linear) arrangements of isolated aggregates. The development of aggregates during the first week of cultivation was followed by active growth of nerve fibers and formation of neuritic interconnections between the aggregates. As a result the linear chains of interconnected aggregates were formed in part of cultures maintained in the collagen wells. The linear aggregate chains were seen more often in cultures of dissociated cells from 12--14-day-old mouse embryos. It is suggested that the formation of the organized (linear) pattern of aggregates depends on the histogenetic properties of the developing brain cells.",Immunology

7426637,"Inhibition of photosystem II by formate. Possible evidence for a direct role of bicarbonate in photosynthetic oxygen evolution. In broken chloroplasts the presence of 100 mM sodium formate at pH 8.2 will specifically lengthen the Photosystem II relaxation times of the reactions S'2 leads to S3 and S'3 leads to S0. Rates of reactions S'0 leads to S1 and S'1 leads to S2 remain unaffected. Evidence is presented which indicates the discrimination among S-states by formate cannot be attributed to a block imposed on the reducing side of Photosystem II. The results are interpreted in context of the known interaction of formate and CO2 which is bound to the Photosystem II reaction center complex. It is proposed that those S-state transitions which show extended relaxation times in the presence of formate must result in the momentary release and rebinding of CO2. Furthermore since formate is acting on the oxygen-evolving side of Photosystem II, it would seem that CO2 is released in reactions that occur there. A chemical model of oxygen evolution is presented. It is based on the hypothesis that hydrated CO2 is the immediate source of photosynthetically evolved oxygen and explains why, under certain conditions formate slows only the S-state transitions S'2 leads to S3 and S'3 leads to S0.",Immunology

SH-rat pituitary and adrenal glands caused fatty infiltration of the liver and hyperlipidaemia indicative of a lipotrophic factor in the SH rat strain. The histopathological changes in the transplanted pituitary and adrenal glands, and in intact pituitary and adrenal glands of the recipients, suggested that SH-rat pituitary glands secrete extra quantities of ACTH, that the pituitary-adrenal axis of this strain is extra sensitive to stressful stimuli, and that the spectrum of adrenal steroids secreted by this strain may be different from that of most normotensive strains.",Immunology

Laser grade (Atlantic Antibodies) and radial immunodiffusion grade materials (Behring Diagnostics) were evaluated in this study. Using Atlantic Antibodies' calibrator, only five of 11 specific proteins assayed in Atlantic control serum were within acceptable ranges; precision was less than that using Hyland materials of identical lots. Mean values for each of 10 of the same 11 specific proteins of Behring control plasma assayed against Behring stabilised human serum, were within manufacturers' acceptable ranges; however, precision was less than that with Hyland materials from identical lots. Nine of the 11 specific proteins in a frozen serum pool sample, measured on the laser nephelometer, agreed well with results of the specific proteins measured by radial immunodiffusion, using the same Behring calibration and quality control. Only the Hyland materials were prediluted for use, which explains the greater precision that was obtained.

7424016,"[Aluminum-balance during haemodialysis (author's transl)]. Aluminium kinetics in patients with endstage renal failure and chronic intermittent haemodialysis have been studied. All patients revealed elevated predialytic serum aluminum levels. Because of a significant correlation between daily intake of aluminiumhydroxyd and serum aluminium levels it is concluded that the intestinal aluminium absorption plays an etiological role in the development of hyperaluminaemia. Plasma aluminium levels at the end of a regular dialysis procedure are significant lower compared to predialytic values. Similarly a significant decrease of aluminium concentration was observed in the plasma after passage through the dialyzer. This is due to the fact that the aluminium content of the dialysate used in our unit (0.1-0.3 mumol/l) is lower than the ultrafiltrable fraction of the plasma aluminium measured in vivo. Therefore a negative aluminium-balance during haemodialysis has to be assumed in our patients. Extreme aluminium-accummulation seems to be avoided and we therefore never experienced aluminium intoxication and dialysis dementia in our center. To assess a negative aluminium balance during haemodialysis, because of high protein binding of aluminium, a dialysate with an extreme low aluminium content has to be recommended.",Immunology

Inhibition of rat liver transketolase under conditions of hydroxythiamin or alimentary B1 avitaminosis was accompanied by an increase in intracellular concentration of 6-phosphogluconate and xylulose-5-phosphate. The alterations in their content was inversely correlated with the transketolase activity. The dehydrogenases involved in the pentose phosphate shunt exhibited various unspecific sensitivity to hydroxythiamin. The doses of the antimetabolites up to 0.4 mg per rat did not alter the activity of the pentose phosphate shunt dehydrogenases; an increase in the dose from 4 up to 20 mg led to an inhibition of the enzymes. Possible biochemical alteration, occurring in response to various degree of transketolase inhibitions, are discussed.",Immunology

Nuclear envelopes are separated into pore-lamina and membrane sub-fractions by extraction in 2.0% Triton X-100 followed by pelleting of the pore-laminae. The polypeptides of these subfractions are then compared with those from isolated rough endoplasmic reticulum. The dispositions of individual polypeptides in the cytoplasmic surface of nuclear envelopes and rought endoplasmic reticulum were studied by lactoperoxidase-catalysed iodination. These studies show that although the nuclear membranes exhibit several homologies with the Triton-soluble polypeptides of the rough endoplasmic reticulum the relative proportion of individual polypeptides within the two systems are very largely different. The cytoplasmic surfaces of the 2 membrane systems show only 2 obvious homologies at 105 000 and 15 000 mol. wt and the overall impression is that, at least in rat liver, the outer nuclear membrane is very substantially differentiated from rough endoplasmic reticulum.

7419597,"Initiation of DNA synthesis in the prematurely condensed chromosomes of G1 cells. The objective of this study was to investigate whether G1 cells could enter S phase after premature chromosome condensation resulting from fusion with mitotic cells. HeLa cell synchronized in early G1, mid-G1, late G1, and G2 and human diploid fibroblasts synchronized in G0 and G1 phases were separately fused by use of UV-inactivated Sendai virus with mitotic HeLa cells. After cell fusion and premature chromosome condensation, the fused cells were incubated in culture medium containing Colcemid (0.05 micrograms/ml) and [3H]thymidine ([3H]ThdR) (0.5 microCi/ml; sp act, 6.7 Ci/mM). At 0, 2, 4, and 6 h after fusion, cell samples were taken to determine the initation of DNA synthesis in the prematurely condensed chromosomes (PCC) on the basis of their morphology and labeling index. The results of this study indicate that PCC from G0, G1, and G2 cells reach the maximum degree of compaction or condensation at 2 h after PCC induction. In addition, the G1-PCC from normal and transformed cells initiated DNA synthesis, as indicated by their ""pulverized"" appearance and incorporation of [3H]ThdR. Further, the initiation of DNA synthesis in G1-PCC occurred significantly earlier than in the mononucleate G1 cells. Neither pulverization nor incorporation of label was observed in the PCC of G0 and G2 cells. These findings suggest that chromosome decondensation, although not controlling the timing of a cell's entry into S phase, is an important step for the initiation of DNA synthesis. These data also suggest that the entry of a S phase may be regulated by cell cycle phase-specific changes in the permeability of the nuclear envelope to the inducers of DNA synthesis present in the cytoplasm.",Immunology

The effects of inorganic salts on adenylate cyclase activities were studied in rat liver homogenates, particulates, and purified membranes. Na+ salts of N-3, NO-2, S2O32-, SO42-, and non-F- halides stimulated homogenates by a maximum of 2---5-fold; half-maximal effects were seen at concentrations ranging from 90 mM (Na2S2O3) to 410 mM (NaNo2). NaIO3 stimulated about 2-fold at relatively low salt concentrations (5---20 mM). Na+ salts were stimulatory using both ATP and the ATP analog 5'-adenylyl-beta, gamma-imidodiphosphate (AMP-P(NH)P) as enzyme substrate. The time courses of stimulation by NaCl and NaN3 were linear to at least 10 min with any of the three tissue preparations. Although salt effects clearly varied with the different anions, the magnitude and dose-response of stimulation of homogenates by Cl- salts were also dependent on the accompanying alkali cation (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+). MgCl2 at relatively high concentrations (50 mM) enhanced NaCl-stimulated activity in homogenates only slightly at relatively low concentrations of NaCl and not at high concentrations, suggesting a common mechanism of activation by Mg2+ and Na+ salts. NaCl- and NaN3-stimulated activities were unstable in homogenates kept at 0 degree C for 4 h, falling to 35% and 50% of their respective baseline activities. The effects on homogenates and particulates of maximally stimulatory concentrations of NaCl and NaN3 were further enhanced by GTP and the GTP analog 5'-guanylyl-beta, gama-imidodiphosphate (GMP-P(NH)P).",Immunology

The synthesis of fatty acids has been measured in vivo with 3H2O in brown adipose tissue, the liver, white adipose tissue and the 'carcass' of cold-acclimated (4 degrees C) golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), and the results compared with those of warm-acclimated (30 degrees C) animals. In warm-acclimated hamsters the highest rate of synthesis was found in the liver, which accounted for more than a quarter of the total body synthesis. Cold-acclimation led to an almost 3-fold increase in whole-body fatty acid synthesis, compared to warm-acclimated animals, and this resulted from increases in all the individual tissues examined, particularly in brown adipose tissue. In cold-acclimated hamsters the rate of synthesis appeared to be similar in brown adipose tissue and the liver. However, studies with Triton WR 1339 suggested that at least one-half of the apparent synthesis in brown adipose tissue resulted from the rapid incorporation into the tissue of fatty acids synthesised elsewhere. On a whole-body basis, the liver made a much greater contribution than brown adipose tissue to total fatty acid synthesis in cold-acclimated hamsters; this is in marked contrast to the relative importance of these two tissues in cold-acclimated rats and mice. It is concluded that in the hamster, an animal widely used for studying the mechanisms of non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue, the fatty acids utilised for generating thermoregulatory heat are synthesised principally in tissues other than brown adipose tissue.",Immunology

The evolutionary significance of anaerobically supported activity has not been discussed, although the interrelationships of capacities for aerobiosis and activity have received considerable attention.

It is known that oxygen inhalation induces coronary vessel constriction as well as brings about a reduction in myocarial oxygen consumption. The present study was performed to clarify whether or not this constriction of the coronary vessels resulting from oxygen is secondary to the reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption. The regional myocardium in 12 mongrel dogs was perfused with femoral arterial blood at a constant rate of flow. While maintaining myocardial oxygen consumption equal by adjusting heart rate, coronary vascular resistance was compared under the two following conditions: 1) perfusion of the coronary artery with the dog's own femoral arterial blood (pO2 : 95 +/- 14 mmHg) and 2) perfusion with blood with a high level of oxygen tension (pO2 : 497 +/- 56 mmHg). Coronary vascular resistance was increased (p < 0.001) from 3.00 +/- 1.25 to 3.36 +/- 1.28 mmHg/ml/min by incresing the pO2 in the perfusing blood, even though myocardial oxygen consumption was kept at the same level. This increase in coronary vascular resistance resulting from the increase in oxygen tension was independent of the coronary perfusion rate as well as independent of the presence or absence of myocardial ischemia. This suggests that coronary vasoconstriction due to oxygen is not secondary to decreases in myocardial oxygen demand.",Immunology

Significant bladder residual urine is secondary to pelvic floor skeletal muscle hypertonicity in some spinal cord injury patients with suprasacral or mixed lesions. Fifteen patients with residual urine volumes greater than 150 cc were treated with dantrolene sodium because of its ability to decrease skeletal muscle contractibility. All of the patients had urethral closure pressures greater than 100 cm. water. Of the 15 patients 8 benefited from dantrolene sodium therapy and were maintained on external condom urinary drainage. Five of these 8 patients required up to 600 mg. dantrolene sodium daily to affect this result. The residual urine volume decreased to less than 100 cc and the post-therapy decrease in urethral pressure averaged 77 cm. water (49 per cent). The patients in the failure group (residual urine greater than 150 cc) had an average decrease in urethral pressure of 21 cm. water (16 per cent). Detrusor hyporeflexia possibly contributed to the failure rate. In summary, dantrolene sodium seems to be beneficial in some patients with external urinary sphincter hypertonicity. However, it will not supplant external sphincterotomy in the more complete male spinal cord injury patient in whom reflex incontinence is of minimal concern. Dantrolene sodium could be an ideal treatment of patients with incomplete neurologic lesions in whom continence might be preserved.

The WHW, WB6 and W bread supplied 1.20, 1.18 and 0.35 mg of B-6 daily, respectively. The remaining constant diet supplied 0.38 mg of B-6. When W was fed, the subjects also received an oral dose of pyridoxine to maintain a daily intake of 1.5 mg of vitamin B-6. Dietary, urinary, fecal and blood samples were analyzed for vitamin B-6. The predominant forms of vitamin B-6 in the diet and urine were pyridoxine and pyridoxal, respectively. Fecal vitamin B-6 excretion was significantly higher (P smaller than or equal to 0.01) and urinary 4-pyridoxic acid excretion significantly lower (P smaller than or equal to 0.05) when WHW bread was fed than when either WB6 or W bread was fed. The plasma pyridoxal phosphate level was slightly lower when WHW bread was consumed as compared to when WB6 was fed. There were no significant differences in urinary B-6, plasma B-6 or the activity of the erythrocyte transaminases in relation to the type of bread fed.

Among the 49 alleles detected at different loci in the HLA complex (A, C, B, Bf, DR) 4 appeared to occur at a significantly higher frequency among the 53 index cases than in a control series of 116 healthy individuals: HLA-B18 (p < 10(-3)), DRw3, DRw4 and BfF1 (p < 10(-6)). The excess of HLA identical affected siblings confirms genotype disequilibrium and supports the hypothesis of an HLA-linked gene(s) conferring susceptibility. There was no increase of homozygosity for HLA DRw3 and DRw4 whereas there was a marked excess heterozygosity for HLA DRw3/DRw4 in diabetic patients (32% versus 0% in the control series, p < 0.001). These data provide evidence for the existence of two cooperating genes, linked to each of the HLA DR alleles.",Immunology

7409338,"Visual function in the preterm and fullterm newborn infant. Visual function in the preterm newborn infant has been studied by the visual orientation (tracking) technique of the Brazelton neurobehavioural assessment, and by the pattern preference and fixation techniques of Frantz. Both these methods demonstrated the presence of discriminative visual function by 31 to 32 weeks gestation, which by 34 weeks reaches a maturity comparable to the pattern found in fullterm infants. Sequential studies at weekly intervals of preterm infants, ranging in gestation from 28 to 32 weeks, have shown a similar pattern of development of visual function to that of the newborn infant of equivalent postconceptional age. However, comparative studies of visual orientation and pattern preference in the same infants have not shown a close correlation. The assessment of visual function in the preterm newborn infant is a valuable milestone. Aberrations may reflect a dificit in visual function itself, a more broad-based deficit in neurological function, or possibly a response to a generalised illness.",Immunology

Transcephalic impedance (the resistance of the head to the flow of a 100 mu-amp alternating current) was measured serially during the first eight days of life in 93 neonates, ranging in gestational age from 26 to 43 weeks. Data compiled from the 70 clinically normal neonates showed an increase in mean trancephalic value with gestational age; this mean increase did not exceed 2.5 ohms during the first eight days of life within any four-week gestational age-group. Seven of the 23 clinically abnormal neonates showed evidence of clinical deterioration typical of intraventricular hemorrhage, and this diagnosis was confirmed at autopsy. Transcephalic impedance for these patients increased considerably with the onset of clinical deterioration, while the impedance for 11 clinically normal neonates, matched with these seven for gestational age, postnatal age and time of impedance measurement, rose only slightly. Transcephalic impedance is an uncomplicated, non-invasive, inexpensive test which has potential as a diagnostic aid in the detection of intraventricular hemorrhage.",Immunology

Progestin(norethindrone and norethindrone acetate)-binding protein, exhibiting characteristics similar to uterine progesterone receptor, has been identified in human uterine cytosol. The progestin receptor was characterized by sedimentation coefficient, 4.2 S; Stokes radius, 39 A; frictional ratio, 1.29; isoelectric pH, 4.6; molecular radius, 2.7 nm; and molecular weight in the range 67 000--74 000. The ammonium-sulfate-precipitated progestin-receptor complex was eluted from a DEAE-cellulose column at 0.18 M KCl. The progestin binding was saturable and stereospecific. The sequential variation in receptor concentration (early proliferative, 3800--4300 sites/cell; late proliferative, 9500--11 200 sites/cell; early secretory, 4900--6200 sites/cell; late secretory, 1800--2300 sites/cell) was in conformity for progesterone and the progestins, when concurrently measured. Oral administration of norethindrone significantly reduced the cytoplasmic and nuclear receptor concentration for estradiol and progesterone. A significant observation was that the progestins stabilized the receptor by forming a slowly dissociating complex with a t 1/2 approximately 110--130 min as compared with the progesterone-receptor complex dissociating with t 1/2 approximately 41 min. Thus, the uterine progestin receptor recognizes progestins in general, although with a varying degree of affinity, and the altered rate constants could be of putative importance in determining the biological potency of the progestins.",Immunology

This paper presents some main results of an investigation by life table methods of birth interval data in cohabitational unions (marriages as well as consensual unions) in current Danish cohorts. Our results confirm previous findings that an early age at the start of recorded exposure to childbearing risk is indicative of a rapid pace and high level of subsequent fertility. The analysis modifies previous results and adds several new details regarding cohort trends and the effect of parity at the start of reported cohabitation. For each parity within a period of cohabitation, fertility differentials by reported starting age seem to have diminished from our older cohorts (of age up to 49 years in 1975) to our younger ones (of age less than 30 years in 1975). There are indications of a dramatic change in childbearing behaviour following the arrival of novel attitudes to non-marital cohabitation and childbearing in Denmark about 1967.",Immunology

The mechanism of secretion of adrenal steroid hormones from adenomas of primary aldosteronism and Cushing's syndrome was studied in 10 patients with primary aldosteronism and in 3 patients with Cushing's syndrome in in vivo and in vitro experiments. In all of the 10 patients with primary aldosteronism, ACTH stimulated aldosterone secretion from the adenomas more significantly than did angiotensin II and III. DOC and cortisol which were contained in the adenomas were also stimulated more significantly by ACTH than by angiotensin II and III. Responses of the adenomas of Cushing's syndrome to various stimulations were less than those of primary aldosteronism. Secretion of cortisol and aldosterone from the adenomas of Cushing's syndrome was stimulated by ACTH and angiotensin II to a similar degree. From these studies, it seems that secretion of adrenal steroid hormones from adenomas of primary aldosteronism is more sensitive to extradrenal stimulations than that of Cushing's syndrome, and ACTH is the main factor in the control of the secretion of adrenal steroid hormones from the adenomas.",Immunology

When the fibroblasts were maintained in glucose-free Eagle's MEM fortified with 3% fetal calf serum, intracellular T4 was unchanged, intracellular T3 decreased, and intracellular rT3 markedly increased as compared with those in Eagle's MEM containing 3% fetal calf serum and 100 mg/dl glucose. In this study, the ratio of T3 to T4 fell, and the ratio of rT3 to T4 and rT3 to T3 rose remarkably in fibroblasts in glucose-deprived media. When the fibroblasts were maintained in Eagle's MEM containing 3% fetal calf serum and various concentration of 2-deoxy-D-glucose, intracellular concentrations of thyroid hormone were decreased as compared with those in 2-deoxy-D-glucose-free control medium. The ratio of rT3 to T4 and rT3 to T3, however, augmented although the ratio of T3 to T4 did not change in fibroblasts in the media with 2-deoxy-D-glucose.

Triplicate pressure-time recordings of grip for each hand were used to calculate maximum grip strength, time required to reach 95% maximum grip strength (t95), total work and maximum power output. Measurements were done on 30 women aged 32 to 74 years (mean, 53 years) who had rheumatoid arthritis and 20 healthy women aged 37 to 69 years (mean, 50 years). The values obtained for patients and healthy women showed that the dominant hand was stronger than the nondominant hand in all women. However, all tests in patients with arthritis indicated decreased function and strength, the relative decrease being greater for nondominant hands compared with dominant hands. This new approach to measurement of hand grip function may provide better discrimination in the quantitative assessment of morning stiffness and response to changes in drug therapy. The time required to achieve 95% of maximum grip strength and maximum power outputs in particular appear to be more sensitive indicators of function than the standard maximum grip strength measurement.",Immunology

The urinary excretion of iron was correlated with the dose of D and the serum ferritin. Continuous subcutaneous infusion of 0.5 g and 1 g D over 12 hours increased the mean urinary iron excretion from 6.6 to 12 mg/day and 9.9 to 18 mg/day respectively compared with intramuscular injection of a similar dose. The test doses of D have been used to determine the dose of D necessary to balance the iron received in transfusion and the iron excreted in the urine. Five children treated for between 7 and 12 months demonstrated that the treatment is effective. Serum ferritin levels decreased and the children were in negative iron balance.

Two sets of blood pressures were taken about 3 minutes apart, each with an occluding cuff connected to the Physiometrics recorder as well as to the mercury sphygmomanometer. The reproducibility of the Physiometrics method was similar to that of the auscultation method. The means of the systolic pressures measured by the Physiometrics method were virtually equal to those of the auscultation method for women and girls; for boys, the means of the former method surpassed those of the latter by about 3 mm. The mean diastolic pressures by the Physiometric method were very close to the Korotkoff sound 5 (K5) pressure by the auscultation method for all three groups. The correlation coefficients between both methods were 0.98 for the systolic and 0.93 for the diastolic pressure of the adult women, and 0.94 for the systolic pressure of the adolescents. The correlations between the two diastolic pressures of adolescents were much less (0.69). The Physiometrics measurements were consistent with the measurements by auscultation for systolic and diastolic pressures of women and systolic pressure of adolescents, but the consistency was low for diastolic pressure of adolescents.

Intraobserver variation was much lower than interobserver variation. Full agreement with respect to the final histopathologic diagnosis between the six observers occurred in only nine instances--all of these were cases of alcoholic liver disease. Some of the biopsies of acute hepatitis were confused with chronic active hepatitis, while others were mistaken for cholestasis, usually believed to have been related to drugs. Biopsies from patients with extrahepatic biliary obstruction were most commonly misdiagnosed as drug cholestasis. However, agreement was higher when the results were calculated in terms of observer pairs by comparing the final diagnosis of each observed with that obtained from each of the other five observers.

Observational methods, using video recordings and computer-assisted data analysis, were used to investigete the behaviour of Toxoplasma-infected mice.

In addition infection affected the pattern of bouts of behaviour, increasing the number of shorter bouts, and this was found to underlie a variety of specific behavioural changes. The results indicate that Toxoplasma infection probably affects the animal's response to its environment and the stimulation arising from it, and may even affect endogenous regulatory processes in the brain.",Immunology

Klebsiella oxytoca fermented amylopectin (97% of the strains studied), carrageenan (100%), inulin (68%), polypectate (100%), and tragacanth (100%). Klebsiella pneumoniae fermented amylopectin (91%), carrageenan (100%), and tragacanth (86%).

Pectobacterium shared polypectate fermentation (100%) with K. oxytoca. With one exception, Serratia strains were negative on all polysaccharides. These results, along with other evidence, indicate that (i) the genus Klebsiella is biochemically the most versatile genus of the tribe, (ii) because of its distinct characteristics, K. oxytoca warrants species designation separate from K. pneumoniae, and (iii) some food additives generally considered indigestible can be metabolized by a few species of facultative bacilli, whereas others appear to be resistant.",Immunology

Properties of calf thymus DNA were investigated after treatment with the pesticides malathion (0,0-dimethyl-S-(1,2-bis ethoxycarbonyl ethyl)dithiophosphate) and DDVP (0,0-dimethyl-0-(2,2 dichlorovinyl)phosphate) in vitro by means of derivative (differential) pulse polarography (DPP), thermal denaturation curves recorded spectrophotometrically (Tm), viscometric measurements, and chromatography on the hydroxyapatite column. Changes in the properties of DNA were observed by means of DPP after only a few hours incubation with the pesticides, whereas the other methods did not detect any changes even after 48 h. The results obtained by DPP indicate that single-stranded segments and thermolabile regions are formed in DNA due to the action of the pesticides. This behaviour could perhaps be a consequence of guanine alkylation followed by depurination and chain scission at elevated temperatures. Malathion and DDVP differ in the kinetics of reaction with double-helical DNA. DDVP is more reactive and its action is also manifested after 72 h in changes in viscosity, Tm, and chromatographic behaviour on the hydroxyapatite column.

Results showed that local application of strychnine produced a general increase of the spontaneous and evoked activity of geniculate cells. By contrast, cortical depression with KCl led to a differential decrement of one of the evoked responses (on or off). Electrical cortical stimulation paired with on or off stimuli led to a differential increment of on or off responses.

7441763,"Morphology of the gastrointestinal tract in primates: comparisons with other mammals in relation to diet. Three categories of dietary adaptation are recognized--faunivory, frugivory, and folivory--according to the distinctive structural and biochemical features of animal matter, fruit, and leaves respectively, and the predominance of only one in the diets of most species. Mammals subsisting mainly on animal matter have a simple stomach and colon and a long small intestine, whereas folivorous species have a complex stomach and/or an enlarged caecum and colon; mammals eating mostly fruit have an intermediate morphology, according to the nature of the fruit and their tendency to supplement this diet with either animal matter or leaves. The frugivorous group are mostly primates: 50 of the 78 mammalian species, and 117 of the 180 individuals included in this analysis are primates. Coefficients of gut differentiation, the ratio of stomach and large intestine to small intestine (by area, weight, and volume), are low in faunivores and high in folivores; the continuous spread of coefficients reflects the different degrees of adaptation to these two dietary extremes. Interspecific comparisons are developed by allowing for allometric factors. In faunivores, in which fermentation is minimal, the volume of stomach and large intestine is related to actual body size, whereas these chambers are more voluminous in larger frugivores and mid-gut fermenting folivores; fore-gut fermenters show a marked decrease in capacity with increasing body size. Surface areas for absorption are related to metabolic body size, directly so in frugivores; area for absorption is relatively less in larger faunivores and more in large folivores, especially those with large stomachs. Indices of gut specialization are derived from these regressions by nonlinear transformation, with references to the main functional features of capacity for fermentation and surface area for absorption. These are directly comparable with the dietary index, derived from quantitative feeding data displayed on a three-dimensional graph, with all species within a crescentic path from 100% faunivory through 55--80% frugivory to 100% folivory, perhaps illustrating, at least for primates, the evolutionary path from primitive insectivorous forms through three major ecological grades.",Immunology

Uptake of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) by sensory axon terminals was studied in lamellated corpuscles of mouse plantar foot pads after i.v. and local s.c. HRP injections. The corpuscles, considered to be rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors, are localized in dermal papillae and have discoid axon terminals enclosed in 1-5 lamellae of lamellar cells. The injected HRP diffused into interlamellar and adaxonal clefts and was taken up by sensory terminals, being incorporated in coated pits and coated vesicles formed by the axolemma. The tracer further appeared in the axoplasm in smooth vesicles, multivesicular bodies, and vacuoles. Similar incorporation of HRP into vesicles, inclusion bodies, and vacuoles was observed in the lamellae and perinuclear cytoplasm of lamellar cells. Vibratory stimulation considered to be adequate for this type of mechanoreceptors did not result in any perceptible increase in HRP uptake by sensory terminals.

The croton oil-derived tumour-promoting agent 12-O-tetra-decanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) exerts pleiotropic effects on the differentiation and proliferation of both normal and malignant animal and human cells in vitro. TPA is mitogenic in nanomolar concentration to chickens embryo fibroblasts and human T lymphocytes and inhibits the terminal differentiation of various committed embryonic cells and mouse Friend erythroleukaemia or myeloid leukaemia cells. TPA induces a terminal cell differentiation in some murine and human myeloid leukaemia and histiocytic lymphoma cells. We report here the effect of TPA on chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) biopsy cells in vitro. In four out of five CLL patients studied, TPA induced the appearance of 90-100% of lymphoblastoid and plasmacytoid cells after 4 days of culture. Under the influence of TPA, 86-97% of the cells expressed with time increasing amounts of intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin (C-Ig) of the same phenotype as that detected on the surface (S-Ig) of fresh, non-induced CLL cells. A parallel decrease in both monoclonal S-Ig density and DNA synthesis of the CLL cells was observed. Electron microscopic studies showed a muturation towards plasma cells. We therefore conclude that TPA is capable of inducing differentiation of CLL cells in vitro.",Immunology

The activities of some enzymes increase during the development of the cellular slime mould, Dictyostelium discoideum. Because optimal specific activity is attained by eachenzyme at a specific developmental stage, development can be followed as a function of enzyme activity. The activity of one of these enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, increases markedly during the late stages of development, making it a potentially useful marker for terminal differentiation. It has been suggested that this increase in activity is due to de novo enzyme synthesis because the increase in activity does not occur in the presence of inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis. However, we present evidence here of reversible heat activation of membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase which suggests that the increase in alkaline phosphatase activity may be due to an unmasking of pre-existing enzyme by a novel membrane regulatory mechanism.",Immunology

The existence of such motor abnormalities throws some doubt on the usefulness of these two mutants as possible models for hereditary deafness in man, which is most frequently uncomplicated. Deol and Kocher have described the deafness mutation in which mice homozygous for the recessive deafness gene (dn/dn) were unresponsive to sound and had no significant behavioural abnormality. Cochlear hair cells in deafness mice develop normally and then degenerate, and the adult animals are completely deaf. We have now studied deafness mice in order to determine the nature of their inherited deafness.

It has been found that cells in the region of the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus are sensitive to osmotic stimuli in a physiological range, and have studied the mechanism by which the osmotic sensitivity arises. An in vitro hypothalamic brain slice preparation has been used to make intracellular recordings from the SON. Cells lying in the SON respond to small increases (9--40 mosmol l-1) in the osmolarity of their external environment with a marked increase in firing rate. They respond to NaCl and mannitol although not to glucose. The osmotic sensitivity of SON neurones has a complex origin at both a pre- and a postsynaptic level, being composed first of depolarization of the primary SON neurone by an increase of extracellular osmolarity and second by an increased rate of occurrence of excitatory synaptic events which markedly augment firing rate. These results are consistent with Jewell and Verney's suggestion that osmoreception in the mammalian brain occurs in the region of the anterior hypothalamus, and extends this localization by indicating that the SON neurones are themselves both directly osmosensitive and part of an osmoreceptive complex.",Immunology

The mean level of serum hTg was increased in untreated differentiated thyroid carcinoma (89.5 +/- 19 ng/ml; n = 13) but not in undifferentiated (10 +/- 2.9 ng/ml; n = 6) or medullary (0.8 +/- 0.2 ng/ml; = 3) carcinoma. In treated differentiated thyroid carcinoma the mean hTg levels were normal (8.2 +/- 0.2 ng/ml) in patients (n = 24) with no evidence of either a thyroid residue or metastatic disease, moderately increased (56.6 +/- 16 ng/ml) in patients (n = 27) with residual thyroid tissue, markedly elevated in patients with lymph node metastases (199 +/- 50 ng/ml; n = 5) and extremely elevated in those with bone (4004 +/- 982 ng/ml; n = 8) or lung (2520 +/- 620 ng/ml; n = 5) metastases. There was no significant difference in serum hTg between functioning (n = 23) and nonfunctioning (n = 5) metastases as assessed by 131I whole body scan. A slight but significant (p < 0.0005) increase in the mean concentration of hTg was observed in nonthyroidal malignancies (21.7 +/- 4.5 ng/ml; n = 10). Serial measurements showed a transient increase of serum hTg after 131I therapy of differentiated thyroid carcinoma, toxic diffuse goiter or toxic adenoma, with peak values usually occurring within the first three days. A fall of serum hTg after administration of suppressive doses of thyroid hormone to patients with nontoxic goiter and a rise after discontinuation of thyroid suppressive therapy in patients with metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Immunology

We determined the penicillin compliance rates in school year 1974-75 for 235 children with rheumatic fever through analysis of urine specimens collected at school. Patients relatively low on compliance during the first year of sampling were divided into two equal size groups for a second year sampling study. One-half (N = 44) of these second year study patients and their parents were readvised regarding the need for penicillin prophylaxis and one-half (N = 44) served as controls. We related eductional data, behavioral ratings, and family information to compliance rates in both study years. The overall compliance for the children during the initial sampling year was 64.6 per cent. Factors found to be significantly related to compliance in year one were: 1) male sex, 2) large sibship, 3) increased number of behavior problems, 4) relatively poor academic progress, 5) lower maternal educational level, and 6) recurrence of rheumatic fever. Compliance rates for reinforced patients did not differ significantly from controls during the second year sampling.",Immunology

The relationship between physician efforts to educate mothers of first born children about child behavior and development, and various outcome measures of mother and child functioning has been extended from 18 months to a time period of two and a half years. As was found earlier, there was a modest relationship between physician effort and mother gain in knowledge about child development, her feeling of being supported by the practice in her child-rearing role, and the frequency of her participation in affectional and cognitively stimulating activities with her child. These relationships, however, did not significantly increase in strength over time. At the end of 30 months there were still no significant positive relationships between teaching input and the child's developmental status, and mothers receiving care form physicians who taught more continued to report more behavior problems with their child than mothers receiving care from physicians who taught less. A content analysis of a small sample of the visits of high and low scoring physicians indicated that neither focused their teaching efforts on ways that mothers could interact with their children in more affectionate and cognitively stimulating ways. It is suggested that more focused teaching in this area might lead to better child development outcomes.",Immunology

A relative risk of 1.73 (p < .01) was estimated when a binary regression procedure was used, controlling for physical health, economic status, social support, and age. Increased life events were associated with health seeking behavior, even when physical and mental health functioning were controlled. The associations between increased life events and both mental health functioning and health seeking behavior were small, suggesting that life events, as measured by the Schedule of Recent Events may not be important risk factors for elderly living in the community.",Immunology

Incubation of a 0.5% suspension of washed normal mouse erythrocytes with ferriprotoporphyrin IX (FP) for 2.5 h at 37 degrees C and pH 7.4 results in sufficient membrane damage to produce hemolysis. A sigmoidal dose-response curve is followed with 50% hemolysis being produced by 4 microM FP. Complete hemolysis is produced by 6 microM FP. The hemolytic process has at least two phases: a lag phase of approximately 45 min, during which little hemolysis occurs, and a phase characterized by rapid hemolysis. Chloroquine, which binds tightly to FP, enhances the effect of FP by eliminating the lag phase. Under the conditions of these experiments, maximum enhancement is observed with chloroquine concentrations in the range of 5-25 microM. Since FP is produced when malaria parasites digest hemoglobin, it may mediate a chemotherapeutic effect of chloroquine by forming a complex with the drug that could enhance the toxicity of FP for biological membranes, including those of the parasite.",Immunology

7416718,"Ability to activate the alternative complement pathway acquired by human and guinea-pig erythrocytes after contact with influenza virus. Human sera exhibited a little haemolytic activity on native guinea-pig erythrocytes, but became potently cytolytic for guinea-pig erythrocytes previously incubated with influenza virus. These haemolytic activities were relevant to complement activation since chelation of Ca++ and Mg++ by EDTA prevented the haemolysis as did also previous heating of sera to 56% C. The haemolysis of native red cells was promoted by human natural antibodies against guinea-pig cellular antigens, which activated the direct pathway of complement. On the other hand, haemolysis of influenza-treated cells was produced by an activation of the alternative pathway since haemolysis occurred in conditions where the direct but not the alternative pathway was blocked. Human antibodies, however, may enhance the alternative pathway but did not trigger it. The same haemolytic phenomena was observed after removal from guinea-pig erythrocyte membrane of sialic acid residues by neuraminidase. While complement-mediated haemolysis never occurred in a homologous system, that is with virus-treated cells and sera from the same species, we noticed in that case a strong haemagglutination. This observation suggested that a species recognition prevented complement mediated haemolysis, but supported the hypothesis of a complement regulation by endogenous protein(s), the complement sequence being blocked before the apparition of the cytolytic activity. The possibility of a role for the complement in the non-specific defence against the infection and a participation to the inflammatory process through this mechanism is also discussed.",Immunology

7400217,"Localization of Ca++-containing antimonate precipitates during mitosis. Intracellular bound Ca++ has been localized throughout mitosis and cytokinesis in two plant species by means of in situ precipitation with potassium antimonate and electron microscope visualization. Identification of Ca++ as the major cation precipitated was made by comparing solubility properties in water, EDTA, and EGTA of the intracellular deposits with respect to those of K+-, Mg++-, and Ca++-antimonate standards. In spermatogenous cells of the water fern, Marsilea vestita, and stomatal complex cells of barley, Hordeum vulgare, antimonate deposits have been found associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), vacuoles, euchromatin/nucleoplasm, and mitochondria. The last contain a much higher density of precipitates in Marsilea than in Hordeum. Dictyosomes and the nuclear envelope of Marsilea also contain antimonate deposits, as do the plasmalemma, cell wall, and phragmoplast vesicles of Hordeum. Microtubule-organizing centers such as kinetochores and the blepharoplast of Marsilea do not stain. In spite of differences in associated antimonate between certain organelles of the two species, the presence of antimonate aong the ER throughout the cell cycle is common to both. Of particular interest are those precipitates seen along the tubules and cisternae of the extensive smooth ER that surrounds and invades the mitotic spindle in both species. The ability to bind divalent cations makes the mitotic apparatus (MA)-associated ER a likely candidate for regulation of free Ca++ levels in the immediate vicinity of structural components and processes that are Ca++-sensitive and proposed to be Ca++-regulated.",Immunology

One group received 10 learning trials daily, seven times a week; one group was trained in the same fashion two times a week and one group was trained once a week. The animals conditioned only once a week achieved a high level of performance in significantly fewer sessions than the ones conditioned seven times a week, although elapsed time from start of training to completion was two to three times greater for the former group. The twice-a-week group learned at an intermediate rate. In the second experiment, the ponies were rearranged into three new groups. They were taught to move backward a specific distance in response to a visual cue in order to avoid an electric shock. Again, one group was trained seven times a week, one group was trained two times and one group was trained once a week.

A single diet, consisting of ground corn cobs and cane molasses and supplemented with soybean meal to 11.5% crude protein, was used. Each steer was fed hourly to maintain a constant digesta flow. Digesta markers used were: polyethylene glycol (PEG) and chromic oxide (Cr2O3), as external markers for the liquid fraction and the particulate fraction, respectively; and indigestible neutral detergent fiber (INDF) and indigestible acid detergent fiber (IADF), as internal markers for the particulate fraction. Treatments were sampling intervals of 24 hr, 48 hr, 48 hr (sampled twice) and 72 hours. Sampling interval did not alter digesta flow through the abomasum. Extending sampling intervals beyond 24 hr or taking more than one sample per day did not appear advantageous. IADF and Cr2O3 appear to be suitable markers for the particulate fraction.

The sodium requirements, balance, excretion, patterns and composition of some pig tissues were studied in two feeding trials and a balance trial followed by an additional feeding period with terminal tissue composition analysis. The growth of pigs fed a corn-soybean meal diet without added salt was severely restricted. Results confirm that a sodium requirement of .09% of the diet is adequate and that .20% NaCl supplementation is adequate for any natural diet for swine. Diets containing .065% sodium caused about a 25% reduction in growth when fed to 10-kg pigs but no significant reduction when fed to 27-kg pigs. Dietary retention was 96% for pigs fed .032% or .067% sodium. Retention was less per unit gain (gain was greater per unit sodium retention) fo9r pigs fed .032% sodium than for pigs fed .067% or more sodium. Those fed .032% sodium had a greater PCV after 1 week on trial and a smaller plasma sodium concentration after 2 weeks.

7400051,"Inheritance of teat number and its relationship to maternal traits in swine. The relationship of teat number to seven measures of female reproduction was evaluated in the University of Nebraska Gene Pool population. Teat number was recorded for 7,513 pigs, ovulation rate for 2,794 gilts and litter size and weight at birth and weaning (42 days) for 789 gilts. Paternal half-sib and full-sib analyses were used to estimate heritabilities for each trait and to estimate the genetic and phenotypic correlations of teat number with the measures of reproduction. The direct response to selection for ovulation rate and the correlated response in teat number were also evaluated from the regressions of line differences (Select-Control) on generation number (10 generations of selection) and cumulative selection differential for ovulation rate. The paternal half-sib heritabililty for teat number was .32, and the paternal half-sib heritabilities for ovulation rate and the litter traits were similar to previous estimates from this population. Most of the genetic and phenotypic correlations with teat number were negative and all were nonsignificant. The realized heritability for ovulation rate was .46 +/- .10. The regression of response in teat number on generation number number was .08 +/- .03 (P < .10). An estimate of .44 was obtained for the realized genetic correlation of teat number with ovulation rate.",Immunology

In 23 dogs anesthetized with chloralose and urethan, we developed a preparation that premitted measurement of isometric tension in segments of the tracheal posterior membrane in situ. Length-tension studies showed an optimal length for contraction in each of 5 segments; in all 5 segments, length was optimal when resting tension was 22-35 g/cm. In 8 other segments, stimuli were delivered by systemic intravenous injections, by electrical stimulation of nerves, or by selective injections into the tracheal circulation; the time between delivery of repeated stimuli required for reproducible responses differed for each form of stimulation. Hypoxemia increased tension by 23.1 +/- 5.5 (SE) g/cm in 10 out of 10 other segments; these increases were the results of reflexes, not direct effects. Because the innervation and vascular supply of these segments were largely intact, we concluded that this preparation permits the study of neurohumoral mechanisms which modulate smooth muscle contraction in a prototypic central airway in vivo.",Immunology

The digoxin infusion was then increased to 0.112 microgram/kg/min (high dose) and five additional collections were made after equilibration. Digoxin was measured by 125I radioimmunoassay whose specificity was confirmed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. With low dose digoxin, the serum digoxin concentration was 0.5 +/- 0.2 (S.D.) ng/ml, CDIG 58 +/- 26 ml/min, inulin clearance (CIN) 48 +/- 8 ml/min and CDIG/CIN 1.2 +/- 0.5.

Two studies are reported which examined the relative effects of the pressence and absence of monetary incentives and instructions in a heart rate (HR) regulation task. Twelve male undergraduates were offered seven sessions of feedback assisted voluntary HR control training. In Experiment 1 six S s attempted to increase their HR with the aid of a ""success,"" or positive binary visual signal. In Experiment 2 six S s were instructed to decrease their HR and were assisted by a ""failure,"" or negative binary visual signal. In both studies the presence or absence of E's specific instructions to control HR was  systematically varied from sessions 4 to 7. S s were paid on only half of the feedback trials of each session. These variables were thus systematically varied in a within-subject design. The main results suggest that (a) the instructions and monetary incentives significantly facilitated HR acceleration while showing no effects on HR deceleration; (b) in the no-instructions, no-incentive condition, HR control was minimal. The general hypothesis that Estes' interpretation of information and reward apply to human voluntary HR control received some support. It would appear that contrary to a traditional view, the exteroceptive feedback per se does not necessarily act as a reinforcer of the behavior, as witnessed for instance in the no-instructions, no-incentive conditions.",Immunology

In this comparative study we investigated whether the same degree of stenosis in either the proximal third of the right coronary artery (RCA) or the proximal third of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) causes critical flow reduction. Lesions were quantified from 35-mm cinefilms in multiple projections using a vernier caliper. These morphometric measurements were correlated with various manifestations of critical flow reduction, such as angina pectoris, development of collateral vessels and segmental wall motion abnormalities. In 13 patients with anginal pain and isolated RCA stenosis, the mean degree of obstruction was 63% area stenosis, which was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that measured in 17 symptomatic patients who had isolated obstructions of the LAD (77% area stenosis). In patients with an identical degree of obstruction (78%) in either the LAD or RCA, collateral vessels were angiographically demonstrable in 53% of the RCA stenoses but in only 29% of the LAD stenoses. Furthermore, when the stenoses were less than 63% in the RCA and LAD, regional wall motion abnormalities were more frequently (p < 0.05) associated with RCA than with LAD stenoses.

A method of rearing large numbers of black flies has been devised using a closed system of water circulation. The subsystems used for hatching, feeding, filtration, and adult trapping are labor-efficient and sufficiently flexible to be useful for rearing most species of temperate and tropical black flies. The filtration subsystem permits a daily assessment of such parameters as larval growth rate, drift, and mortality so that life table statistics can be derived for populations of immatures. Four species of black flies, Simulium pictipes, S. vittatum, S. decorum, and Cnephia dacotensis, were used in developing this unique rearing system. Percentage survival varied with species and appeared to be a function of food quantity within discrete particle-size intervals. Over 28,000 larvae of C. dacotensis were reared in a single unit with 89.3% surviving to the adult stage. In each of two rearings of S. pictipes, conducted under different nutritional regimens, approximately 60% survived to the imaginal stage. Over 9,500 adults of S. vittatum were reared from 12,127 eggs. An F1 generation of S. decorum was produced from parental stock that originated as field-collected larvae.

Several schedules of benzene exposure were evaluated for their effects on peripheral white blood cell counts, bone marrow cellularity and transplantable colony forming units (CFU-S) in male C57 Bl/6 mice. Intermittent exposure to 4000 ppm benzene in air produced leukopenia without altering the bone marrow cellularity. This same treatment, however, decreased the number of CFU-S to 30% of control values. Uninterrupted exposure to lower levels of benzene decreased peripheral cell counts within 24 h, and later decreased marrow cellularity. Exposure of a non-dividing population of stem cells (CFU-S) to benzene for up to 24 h produced no detectable effect on the subsequent development of spleen colonies, suggesting that the effect of benzene on CFU-S occurs only after peripheral cells are depleted. These findings indicate that benzene has affects on both differentiated cells and undifferentiated stem cells. An effect on the pluripotential stem cell is an important aspect of benzene toxicity, but not its exclusive or initial site of action.",Immunology

The toxic effects were manifest as an increase in maternal mortality, circulatory damage, decreased gain in body weight, decrease in the weight of the placenta in the mothers and an increase in mortality (early and late), retardation of development (weight and skeleton) in the fetuses. No further change in the parameters was seen with further increases in benzene concentration.

The development of the polarized surface binding of the fluoresceinated ligand concanavalin A (FITC-Con A) was studied in blastomeres of the early mouse embryo. Single 8-cell blastomeres, natural 8-cell couplets derived from the in vitro division of individual 4-cell blastomeres, and reagregated couplets made from dissociated 8-cells were cultured for varying periods of time and on a variety of substrata. The development of surface polarity was found to be highly dependent upon cell contact. Over 50% of the cells in couplets were polarized after 4-5 hr in culture, with the smaller cell in the couplet usually more advanced in its polarization than the larger cell. The orientation of the poles of FITC-Con A binding was opposite the point of contact between cells in the couplets regardless of their previous orientation within the embryo or the plane of cleavage.",Immunology

Increased levels of SFMC were observed in patients with high leukocyte cell counts after induction chemotherapy which may reflect the release of thromboplastic material from destructed leukemic cells. Patients with low leukocyte counts showed only a moderate increase in SFMC.

The functional capillary density in subepicardial and subendocardial layers of rat heart was measured during rest and during isoprenaline-induced (5.0 microgram X kg-1 X min-1, i.v. over 3 minutes) cardiac stimulation. For determination of the number of perfused capillaries, a fluorescent dye (thioflavine S) was infused into the left atrium; 1, 3, 5 and 10 sec, respectively, after starting dye application, hearts were excised and rapidly cooled down to -50 degrees C. In histological sections capillaries which had been perfused during the dye infusion could be identified and counted. An increase in the number of stained vessels was found in both layers of the myocardium when the time of dye exposure was prolonged. Under these conditions the rise was much smaller in isoprenaline-treated animals, this effect being most marked in the subendocardial layer (3560 +/- 199 cap./mm2, control group; 2190 +/- 30 cap./mm2, isoprenaline-treated group; dye exposure 10 sec). Isoprenaline - at the dose used - induced an increase in total blood flow (3.7 +/- 0.6 ml X min-1 X g-1, control group; 6.8 +/- 0.7 ml X min-1 X g-1, isoprenaline-treated group), however, with a relatively less pronounced increase in the subendocardial blood flow (subendocardial/subepicardial flows: 1.08 +/- 0.13, control group; 0.66 +/- 0.01, isoprenaline-treated group). These results favour the view that isoprenaline-induced relative reduction in the subendocardial blood flow is due to disturbance of perfusion pressure and extravascular compression rather than to exhaustion of the myocardial capillary reserve.",Immunology

7433860,"Abnormalities of oxidative phosphorylation due to excess of deficiency of thyroid hormones. ATP synthesis requires the presence of thyroid hormones that activate oxidative phosphorylation. ATP supports the energy consuming reactions such as actin-myosin interaction, calcium and sodium pump, which are essential in a normal heart function. Thyroid insufficiency depresses mitochondrial oxidation, leading to ATP depletion which can not be compensated by activated glycolysis. Glycolysis under conditions of hypoxia due to accumulation of lactate or NADPH, impairs membrane permeability and mitochondrial function, causing enzyme release and pump failure. In severe hyperthyroidism an ATP deficiency occurs by uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, T4 stimulating the extra-mitochondrial metabolic pathways. There is a disproportion between consumption of O2 and nutrients and ATP production. The T4--T3 excess via trace metal (magnesium, copper, zinc, iron, etc.) chelation inhibits enzyme activity which had impaired ATP synthesis. At the same time the excess of T4 by stimulating ATP-ase causes heat release and dissipation of ATP, favouring cardiothyreosis.",Immunology

Using an intramyocardial pH needle probe (21 gauge) to monitor myocardial metabolism during ischemia, we determined the effect of potassium cardioplegia at both moderate and deep hypothermia. Five groups of 5 dogs each were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and the pH probe was inserted approximately 10 mm into the left ventricular free wall. Cardiac ischemia was achieved by cross-clamping the ascending aorta at 37 degrees C (Group 1), 27 degrees C (Group 2), or 17 degrees C (Group 3). In the remaining two groups, aortic cross-clamping was followed by the infusion of 600 to 800 ml of potassium cardioplegic solution adjusted to cardiac temperatures of 27 degrees C (Group 4) or 17 degrees C (Group 5). In each group, myocardial temperature was maintained constant, electrical and mechanical activity observed, and pH recorded until a plateau was reached or for 3 hours. Our results show a progressive and significant decrease in the metabolic rate with reduction in temperature over the 37 degrees to 17 degrees C range. By abolishing contractile activity, potassium cardioplegia markedly reduces the rate of hydrogen ion accumulation at 27 degrees C, but at 17 degrees C the additive effect of cardioplegia is much less pronounced. These observations support the principle of reducing contractile activity to a minimum during elective arrest of the heart but indicate that potassium cardioplegia does little to further reduce the rate of anaerobic metabolism, as shown by the measurement of intramyocardial pH, under conditions of deep hypothermia.",Immunology

G. pallidipes fed mainly on bovids in the two villages; bushbuck was the most favoured host (44.9% of all blood feeds) though in Buyundo buffalo provided a significant alternative (20.8%). G. f. fuscipes frequently fed on bovids (75.6%), particularly bushbuck (46.7%), but it had a wider range of acceptable hosts. In both villages, G. brevipalpis took most of its blood meals from bushpig (45.5%), bovids (25.6%) and hippopotamus (28.5%). The feeding patterns of the three tsetse species during different months of the study period showed only small variations, and such differences were due probably to variations in the availability of the hosts. Examination of the relationships between trypanosome infection rates and natural hosts of the three vector species showed that the vivax-type infections originated from bovids, possibly bushbuck, while the congolense-type trypanosome came from bovids as well as bushpig. Hippopotamus probably had no trypanosome infections. There was a positive correlation between the trypanosome infection rates in the tsetse and the increasing mean maximum temperatures. In this region of Uganda, there was continuous transmission of pathogenic trypanosomes by the three tsetse species among their natural hosts; when present, the vectors' adventitious hosts became exposed to a high risk from the diseases. Man-fly contact during different months was impersonal, but high and sporadic. This is a high endemic region for human trypanosomiasis.

The ratio [14C]urate (counts/min per nanoliter of tubular cell water)/(counts/min per nanoliter of incubation medium) (T/M) reached 2.92 +/- 0.31 (mean +/- SE; n = 15), 6.08 +/- 0.42 (n = 42), and 1.72 +/- 0.31 (n = 14) for S1, S2, and S3 segments, respectively. In these segments the uptake of [3H]PAH was 22.7 +/- 4.6 (n = 19), 133 +/- 18.9 (n = 24), and 66.2 +/- 15.3 (n =0). The accumulation of [14C]urate was saturated at 2 x 10(-4) M in the medium, and that of [3H]PAH at 7 x 10(-5) M in the medium. Secretory transport was saturated at the same bath PAH concentration in perfused tubules.

7435556,"Effects of diabetes on oxidative decarboxylation of branched-chain keto acids. Oxidative decarboxylation is the first irreversible step in the degradation of leucine. The effect of streptozotocin diabetes on this reaction was studied in cell-free rat liver preparations, using [1-14C]alpha-ketoisocaproate as substrate. Diabetes increased the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) activity (per g liver or per mg protein) of homogenates, but the ratios of homogenate BCKD activity to other mitochondrial markers remained unchanged. A cytosolic branched-chain ketoacid decarboxylase activity (15-22% of homogenate activity), which did not require NAD, CoA, or NADP, was also increased in diabetics. Insulin treatment of diabetics normalized enzyme activity in all fractions. The apparent Km of BCKD in homogenates was 43-45 microM; diabetes increased the apparent Vmax from 165 nmol x min-1 x g tissue-1 to 260 nmol x min-1 x g-1. In contrast, the Km for cytosolic alpha-ketoisocaproate decarboxylation was 270 microM in controls, and diabetes resulted in both a lower Km (210 microM) and a higher Vmax. Adrenalectomy did not affect activity in homogenates from controls, but partially reversed the diabetes-associated increase. Glucagon pretreatment of controls did not affect activity. In summary, distinct mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes decarboxylate alpha-ketoisocaproate in liver. The increased hepatic capacity of diabetic rats to degrade the carbon skeleton of leucine is attributed mainly to a relative increase in mitochondrial mass.",Immunology

In addition, we have partly replaced the bathing chloride with bromide, iodide, or thiocyanate and studied the effects of these anions on 36Cl fluxes. Our results show that the affinity sequence for the chloride transport process is I > Br congruent to Cl, that Br is transported, but that I is not.

In nine chronically catheterized fetal lambs (120 to 135 days; term 147 days) umbilical venous blood flow and its distribution were measured by the radionuclide-labeled microsphere technique before and during autonomic blockade with atropine (0.20 to 0.25 mg/kg; seven studies) or phentolamine (0.10 to 0.12 mg/kg; six studies). Atropine significnatly increased mean fetal heart rate (182 to 207 beats/min), descending aortic blood pressure (49 to 55 mm Hg), and umbilical venous blood flow (210 to 239 ml/min/kg fetus), without changing umbilical venous blood pressure. Phentolamine decreased mean descending aortic pressure (48 to 45 mm Hg), but did not affect heart rate, umbilical venous blood pressure, or umbilical venous blood flow. Neither atropine nor phentolamine altered the distribution of umbilical venous blood flow to the ductus venosus, the liver, or the other fetal organs. These data indicate that the cholinergic nervous system only indirectly affects the basal umbilical venous blood flow in the near-term fetal lamb. This effect is small and is secondary to associated changes in heart rate and arterial blood pressure. Neither the cholinergic nor the alpha-adrenergic systems influence the basal distribution of umbilical venous blood flow.",Immunology

Plasma levels of deoxycorticosterone throughout pregnancy of normal women and women who developed pregnancy-induced hypertension. The plasma concentration of deoxycorticosterone (DOC) was determined serially in a large group of primigravid women from 10 weeks' gestation to term. The plasma level of DOC in women whose pregnancies were uncomplicated (n = 44) was 234 +/- 33 pg/ml (mean +/- SE), at 10 to 14 weeks' gestation, a level two times that of nonpregnant subjects. The plasma level of DOC in these women rose to 778 +/- 65 pg/ml at 23 to 26 weeks' gestation, and at term (39 to 42 weeks) was 1,309 +/- 155 pg/ml. The plasma levels of DOC in women (n = 31) who eventually developed pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) were similar to those in the women who remained normal at all stages of pregnancy. We also found that, in women with normal pregnancies as well as in all stages of pregnancy. We also found that, in women with normal pregnancies as well as in women destined to develop PIH, the plasma concentration of DOC fluctuated in a manner parallel to that of progesterone throughout gestation; however, changes in the plasma level of DOC did not mirror those of cortisol. These data suggest that excessive plasma levels of DOC are not necessarily associated with the development of PIH. These data also support the view that, in pregnant women, a fraction of circulating DOC may arise via extra-adrenal 21-hydroxylation of progesterone rather than through adrenal secretion.",Immunology

The results obtained do not support the hypothesis that peroxidase activity is determined by the levels of circulating estrogens, as is apparently true in rats. Extremely high levels of peroxidase activity were noticed in some, but not all, specimens of endometrial adenocarcinoma. Endometrial glands were separated from the stroma after collagenase digestion of normal and abnormal endometrial glands were separated from the stroma after collagenase digestion of normal and abnormal endometrium, and peroxidase activity was measured in each fraction.

These three populations were (a) 61 singly innervated fibers (SIFs), (b) 10 multiply innervated fibers of relatively constant 10 micrometer diameter (10 micrometer MIFs), and (c) 22 multiply innervated fibers which are of about 5 micrometer diameter toward the middle of their length and of about 15 micrometer diameter toward their proximal and distal segments (5--15 micrometer MIFs). The orbital surface layer was sampled by electron microscopy at 68 sequential locations. Membrane--glycogen complexes were not seen in any of the 1738 samples of the SIFs. In the MIFs, such complexes were observed in 14% of the 1541 samples. However, both the 10 micrometer MIFs and 5--15 micrometer MIFs displayed a preferential concentration of membrane--glycogen complexes toward their distal fiber portions, and such complexes were seen in about 50% of the MIF samples near the beginning of the muscle's distal third.

All of them were admitted with signs of severe heart and/or respiratory insufficiency, and 12 (30%) of the patients required mechanical ventilation. The concentration of FDP/fdp was significantly higher in 28 of 29 patients with positive arteriography (mean 145 microgram/ml), that in those whose arteriography was negative (in every cases the FDP/fdp level was lower than 10 microgram/ml). To help differentiate pulmonary embolism from other acute heart or pulmonary diseases, the authors measured the FDP/fdp in 10 patients with bacterial pneumonia, 24 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 4 patients with extrinsic asthma, and 18 normal control subjects. The authors found high levels of FDP/fdp (more than 10 microgram/ml) in only 2 patients with pneumonia and in 6 with myocardial infarction. In no case was the level of FDP/fdp higher than 40 microgram/ml. On the other hand, in patients with pulmonary embolism, 23 (79%) had levels higher than 40 microgram/ml. The study indicates that this test is a helpful screening method for pulmonary embolism, especially in situations where other emergency diagnosis tests are inconclusive or impractical; it also provides justification for beginning anticoagulant therapy and for recommending pulmonary arteriography.",Immunology

To accurately quantitate dynamic events associated with gallbladder filling and emptying, we developed a cholescintigraphic technique in which the radionuclide 99mTc-HIDA excreted in bile was externally measured by a gamma camera interfaced to a computer programmed for data processing. Changes in activity with time were measured over the liver, bile ducts, gallbladder, small intestine, and stomach. The first 60 min were used to detect activity filling the gallbladder. Cholecystokinin was then infused at 0.020 U/kg/min for 30 min to initiate gallbladder contraction, while monitoring the evacuation of radionuclide into the small intestine and/or stomach. The stomach region was defined by a 99mTc-sulphur colloid swallow. With computer assistance, we were able to measure the rate at which the gallbladder filled, the fraction of liver activity that partitioned into the gallbladder instead of the duodenum, the rate of gallbladder empyting, and any gastric reflux. In 12 fasting, healthy subjects, three-fourths of the hepatic activity entered the gallbladder. After a 5-min time lag, gallbladder empyting commenced in response to the cholecystokinin, ejecting half its contents in 12 min, but still having a residual 25% after 30 min. Gallbladder evacuation was definitely slower in 6 patients with cholelithiasis, although filling appeared normal. One patient with gallstones underwent a repeat study after 4 mo on chenodeoxycholic acid therapy: Gallbladder filling, and especially emptying, deteriorated. Gastric reflux occurred only in 2 patients with gastroenterostomies who refluxed 2% of their gallbladder contents into the gastric remnant.

Treatment with LH antiserum before implantation did not inhibit progesterone secretion, but luteal function was severely impaired when the antiserum was given on Days 5--9 of pregnancy. These results demonstrate the dynamic nature of luteal dependency on prolactin and LH, and indicate that LH is an essential component of the luetotrophic complex of the mouse.",Immunology

7430247,"Effects of fasciculation on the outgrowth of neurites from spinal ganglia in culture. This report describes the influence of neurite fasciculation on two aspects of nerve growth from chick spinal ganglia in vitro: the inhibition of outgrowth by high concentrations of nerve growth factor (NGF) and the preferential growth of neurites toward a capillary tube containing NGF. These studies involved a comparison of cultures of single cells, cell aggregates, and intact ganglia and the use of antibodies against the nerve cell adhesion molecule (CAM) to perturb fasciculation under a variety of conditions. The inhibition of outgrowth, which was observed with ganglia and aggregates but not with single cells, was correlated with a thickening of neurite fascicles. In accord with this observation, anti-CAM, which diminishes fasciculation by inhibiting side-to-side interactions between individual neurites, also partially reversed the inhibition of neurite outgrowth at high NGF concentrations. On the basis of these and other studies, we consider the possibility that neurite bundling causes an increase in the elastic tension of a fascicle without a compensatory increase in its adhesion to substratum. It is proposed that this imbalance could inhibit neurites from growing out from a ganglion and even result in retraction of preexisting outgrowth. In the analysis of NGF-directed growth, it was found that a capillary source of NGF produced a steep but transient NGF gradient that subsided before most neurites had emerged from the ganglion. Nevertheless, the presence of a single NGF capillary caused a dramatic and persistent asymmetry in the outgrowth of neurites from ganglia or cell aggregates. In contrast, processes of individual cells did not appear to orient themselves toward the capillary. The most revealing finding was that anti-CAM antibodies caused a decrease in the asymmetry of neurite outgrowth. These results suggest that side-to-side interactions among neurites can influence the guidance of nerve bundles by sustaining and amplifying an initial directional signal.",Immunology

The levels of isometric developed tension (IDT) in portal veins from starved and diabetic rats in glucose medium were of the same magnitude but significantly reduced compared with veins from normal rats. Glucose removal led to contractile depression, more marked in starved veins (-74%; p < 0.001 vs. diabetics and normals). Addition of glucose, pyruvate, acetate, lactate, or butyrate counteracted this depression in all groups but in diabetics butyrate significantly stimulated IDT over controls whereas in starved veins lactate overcame IDT reduction only partially. Added insulin significantly enhanced contractile recovery with glucose in normal and diabetic preparations but was ineffective in starved veins. Glycogen content was significantly lower in diabetics; however, in no group did changes occur in incubated veins as compared with unincubated ones. Glycerol production was significantly higher in diabetic veins. It would appear that, although experimental diabetes induces a shift to fatty acid utilization, aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration are somehow preserved as reflected by the IDT recovery with pyruvate or lactate.",Immunology

In an ischemic Thiry-Vella colonic segment which was constructed to facilitate the serial measurement of submucosal blood flow by radioxenon clearance, we found that, after producing ischemia, the submucosal xenon clearance fell from 68+/-3 to 21+/-4 percent. In the succeeding two hours, a further fall in xenon clearance to 16+/-3 per cent occurred as a result of vasoconstriction in the peripheral mesenteric bed. From 24 hours onward, the submucosal flow increased. However, throughout the 96 hours, no healing of the ischemic necrosis was seen in the mucosa, and submucosa.

With the use of a precise and unique model, pancreatic secretion was studied in three humans who had chronic pancreatitis. The observed results show a decrease in pancreatic secretory pressure and volume during the administration of an elemental diet, Vivonex HN, compared with regular feedings. Levels of secretory function were near those observed during fasting in the two patients receiving the elemental diet. The variably low levels of enzyme activity observed during the administration of Vivonex HN suggest only minimal stimulation of cholecystokinin. It would seem that the primary inhibitory effect of the elemental diet may be more specifically related to a reduction of secretin release. Although the numbers of observations carried out during this study were small, the precise nature of the model being studied allows the conclusion that the administration of a low fat elemental diet to patients with chronic pancreatitis produces minimal stimulation of pancreatic secretion.",Immunology

Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a stable product of arachidonic acid metabolism, catalyzed by the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase. The experimental conditions for measuring the kinetic of MDA formation in rat platelet-rich plasma were defined. In platelets stimulated with arachidonic acid MDA formation was almost linear for a limited period of time (between 0 and 2 min) and was concentration-dependent with saturation kinetics. The hyperbolic curves obtained were recast in a linear plot (according to transformation S/V versus S) and straight lines fitting all experimental points were obtained. The apparent Km value of arachidonic acid was 0.49 +/- 0.09 mM and Vmax 1.44 +/- 0.06 nmoles MDA/1.4 x 10(9) platelets/min. The apparent type of inhibition and the relative potency of acetylsalicylic acid and indomethacin on MDA formation were also investigated. Inhibition by both drugs was concentration-dependent, and was much stronger when either drug was preincubated with platelets for 10 min than for 1 min. Analysis of the data by Dixon plots (1/V versus inhibitor concentrations) revealed an apparently competitive type of inhibition. It is suggested that both acetylsalicylic acid and indomethacin inhibit cyclo-oxygenase in platelet-rich plasma by a similar mechanism, not involving covalent binding of either drug to the enzyme.",Immunology

An animal model was developed to study the histology and collagen chemistry of healing cortical bone. A hole was cut through the cortex of the mid-shaft of the humerus of the adult chicken, which allowed for repair at a mechanically stable site. After one to two weeks the collagen of the repair tissue, which consisted principally of woven bone, contained almost three times as much hydroxylysine as the collagen of normal adult bone and thus resembled the collagen of embryonic long bones. By eight weeks, when lamellar one predominated, the hydroxylysine content had fallen to normal levels. Type I was the major genetic type of collagen present throughout. No type-II collagen, characteristic of cartilage, was detected; this was consistent with the histological findings. The results established that hydroxylysine-rich type-I collagen can be made by osteoblasts of adult animals as well as by those of embryos and early postnates. In order to understand the biological characteristics of fracture healing, it is vital to study not only the macroscopic organization of the repair tissue but also the chemical properties of its molecular components. The strength of healing fractured bone, and indeed of normal bone, depends largely on the properties of the structural protein collagen. To date, it is not known whether the collagen in healing fractures is the same as that in normal bone, or whether it has distinct chemical features that may suit it for bone repair.",Immunology

The regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase I has been cleaved proteolytically into two structurally independent domains. The larger domain (35K with trypsin or thermolysin and 31K with chymotrypsin) corresponded to the COOH-terminal end of the polypeptide chain and retained the cAMP binding site(s). The smaller domain (11 to 12K with trypsin), corresponding to the NH2-terminal region of the regulatory subunit, contained the region of dimer interaction. In the absence of reducing reagent, the two protomers of the native regulatory subunit and of the smaller domain could be covalently cross-linked by a disulfide bond. In addition to the two major domains, a 15-residue peptide that links the two domains has been isolated and partially characterized. Two major sites on the type I regulatory subunit were susceptible to proteolytic degradation. Site 1, susceptible to cleavage by both trypsin and thermolysin, has the following sequence: LysArg-Arg-Gly-Ala-Ile-Ser-Ala-. Cleavage at this site generated a 35K cAMP-binding fragment. Site 2 contained a chymotryptic cleavage site as well as a secondary tryptic site. The sequence at Site 2 was Val-Arg-Arg-Val-Ile-Ala. Cleavage here generated a 31K cAMP-binding fragment. Both sites contained 2 consecutive basic amino acid residues similar to the corresponding sequence in the type II regulatory subunit; however, in the case of the type I regulatory subunit, the serine at Site 1 does not serve as a site of autophosphorylation.

The mitochondrial energy-linked transhydrogenase enzyme catalyzes hydride ion transfer between NAD and HADP, of which the reaction NADH leads to NADP is slow in the absence of energy and is accelerated 10-fold or more when the mitochondrial membrane is energized by ATP hydrolysis or respiration. The enzyme is a proton pump and effects proton translocation coupled to hydride ion transfer from NADPH to NAD (Earle, S.R., and Fisher, R.R. (1980) J. Biol Chem. 255, 827-830). The present studies have shown that submitochondrial particles also catalyze transhydrogenation from NADPH to two NADP analogs, namely 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (AcPyADP) and thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (thioNADP). Both reaction rates are greatly accelerated when the system is energized by ATP hydrolysis (inhibitable by uncouplers or rutamycin) or succinate oxidation (inhibitable by uncouplers or antimycin A). As in the case of NAD(H) in equilibrium with NADP(H) reactions, the transhydrogenations from NADPH to AcPyADP and thioNADP are inhibited by treatment of submitochondrial particles with trypsin or the arginyl residue modifier, butanedione. The Km values of the above substrates and the Vmax values under energy-linked conditions have been determined.

Cardiac troponin C (C-TnC) was labeled with the sulfhydryl-specific fluorescent probe molecule 2-(4'-iodoacetamidoanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid at cysteine 35 and 84 to produce C-TnCIA. This modified protein binds Ca2+, undergoes Ca2+-induced increases in alpha helix, and forms a complex with other troponin subunits as does unlabeled C-TnC. C-TnCIA undergoes a small fluorescence decrease with Ca2+ or Mg2+ binding to the two high affinity Ca2+-Mg2+ sites of C-TnC and a large biphasic approximately 2.1-fold fluorescence increase with Ca2+ binding to two lower affinity Ca2+-specific sites with KCa of approximately 4.5 X 10(5) M-1 and approximately 5 X 10(2) M-1. C-TnCIA was formed in a complex with troponin I (TnI) and troponin T to form C-TnIA. This fluorescent reconstituted whole troponin undergoes a 25% decrease with Ca2+ binding to a Ca2+-specific site of KCa approximately 3 X 10(6) M-1. C-TnC, therefore, contains a single Ca2+-specific site of approximate equal affinity as the two Ca2+-specific regulatory sites of skeletal TnC. This Ca2+-specific site in C-TnC (like its two corresponding sites in S-TnC) undergoes an approximate 10-fold increase in affinity in whole troponin or when TnC is complexed with TnI. Since the two Ca2+-specific sites in skeletal troponin have been shown to be the regulatory sites of skeletal muscle contraction we suggest that this single Ca2+-specific site, of equal affinity, in C-TnC is the regulatory site of cardiac muscle contraction.",Immunology

Fifty consecutive adults with sarcoma were treated with Adriamycin (45 mg/m2) on day 1, cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) on day 2, and DTIC (400 mg/m2) on days 1 and 2 (CAD). Of the 23 patients with measurable metastatic disease, 4 patients (17%) had a complete response, 9 patients (39%) had a partial response, 5 patients (22%) had stabilization, but 5 patients (22%) did not respond. The actuarial survival of complete and partial responders was 31.5 months compared to 5.5 months for non-responders (P < .005). Chemotherapy doses were escalated to a median lowest white count of 700 cells/mm3. Acute gastrointestinal toxicity and alopecia occurred in all patients. CAD differed from previously reported combinations by omission of vincristine, a two-day dose schedule and dose rate intensification.

7427758,"Effects of centrally administered pentazocine and ethylketocyclazocine on thermoregulation in the cat. The mechanisms for the biphasic response of unrestrained cats to centrally administered pentazocine were examined by injecting 1 mg pentazocine into the third cerebral ventricle at various ambient temperatures (TaS). The initial phase was hyperthermia at Ta = 34 degrees C, but at Ta = 22 degrees C hypothermia, which was enhanced at Ta = 0 degrees C, developed. The second phase was an increase in body temperature that occurred at all three TaS. No evidence was seen of compensatory thermoregulatory effector activity during development of either phase. The first phase can be attributed to general depression of thermoregulation whereas the second phase was likely due to an increase in the level about which body temperature was regulated. Ethylketocyclazocine (250-1000 micrograms) caused a very similar, dose-related change in temperature, neither phase of which, as reported previously for pentazocine, was reduced by a large dose of nalaxone. Thus both agonists appear to act on the same receptors to alter thermoregulation in the cat. These receptors are distinct from the naloxone-sensitive receptors stimulated by morphine.",Immunology

Diseases associated with defective reticuloendothelial release of iron may be difficult to distinguish from the iron-deficient state, since serum iron parameters (serum iron, percentage saturation of transferrin less then 15%) may overlap. Assessment of the bone marrow biopsy iron stores was often necessary to resolve the diagnosis. Serum ferritin levels have proved very useful in distinguishing the uncomplicated iron-deficient state from other disorders associated with low serum iron and low percentage saturation of transferrin. However, a small percentage of iron-deficient persons may have normal ferritin values, particularly if these persons have liver disease or hematopoietic or lymphoreticular neoplasms. In these cases, assessment of the bone marrow biopsy iron would still be necessary to evaluate the body iron stores.",Immunology

Since it has been suggested that aspirin-induced asthma is due to inhibition of prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis, the present investigation was undertaken to determine whether tartrazine would display a similar profile. Use was made of the exquisite sensitivity of blood platelets, both in humans and in rats, to aggregating substances generated from arachidonic acid during PG biosynthesis and of the ability of aspirin to inhibit aggregation and generation of those substances. Failure to affect aggregation by arachidonic acid as well as the accompanying formation of thromboxane A2, demonstrates that neither tartrazine nor its metabolite sulfanilic acid inhibit platelet PG synthesis. It seems unlikely that tartrazine-induced asthma results from inhibition of PG biosynthesis.",Immunology

The electron transport system of the organism is characterized by weak activities of NADH- and NADPH-oxidoreductases and a weak activity of the oxidase region. The respiration of intact cells in the presence of various substrates and the activity of enzymes of the respiration chain in E. shaposhnikovii do not depend on how the cells were grown.

Astronauts utilize water cooling in a liquid-cooled garment to maintain thermal comfort during extravehicular activities (EVA's). In the Apollo and Skylab Programs, manual control of the cooling water was a necessary operation to ensure proper control of body heat storage for the EVA crewman. The development of an automatic thermal control system would be a valuable asset to the conduct of EVA, relieving the crewman of a task that can interfere with his EVA objectives. An analytical model of human thermoregulation was used to develop the equations governing the operation of such an automatic controller. A series of tests verified the feasibility of a controller utilizing only a measurement of the difference in coolant temperature into and out of the astronaut's liquid-cooled garment and an estimate of environmental heat loss to maintain the proper crewman thermal balance. Three test subjects performed over a wide range of metabolic rates, and the crewman heat balance was maintained well within allowable medical limits. This study demonstrates the use of a mathematical model to generate previously unknown physiological relationships between human thermal comfort and liquid cooled garment performance. In so doing, it quantitates physiological parameters that are difficult to relate directly by experiment.

7412237,"Relation of maximal opening of disk valves to characteristics of aortic blood flow. The maximal extent of disk opening of the Lillehei-Kaster and Björk-Shiley aortic disk prosthetic valves was evaluated in vitro in relation to the characteristics of flow across the valve and valve orientation within the test section. The maximal opening angle of the disk of both types of prostheses was related to the mean systolic ejection rate, cardiac output, and maximal instantaneous aortic flow. Full opening of all valves occurred throughout the entire hydrodynamic range tested when the orientation of the valve was such that the disk opened in the direction of gravitational forces. However, when the valve was oriented to open against the direction of gravitational forces, less than full opening was observed at low flow rates. At such low rates of flow, the extent of opening was also dependent upon valve size. These studies indicate that full opening of the Lillehei-Kaster and Björk-Shiley disk valves appears to be affected by the orientation of the valve relative to gravitational forces. When less than full opening occurs, it is associated with abnormally low mean systolic ejection rates and low levels of cardiac output and aortic flow. Therefore, irrespective of valve orientation, less than maximal opening with normal flow may indicate a mechanical impediment to opening.",Immunology

Humoral suppressive factors were identified in the plasma of 13 of 14 patients with schistosomiasis mansoni. These factors suppressed lymphocyte proliferative responses to parasite antigens but did not affect lymphocyte responses to either nonparasite antigens or mitogens. Furthermore, they had no inhibitory effect on proliferative responses of lymphocytes of normal, noninfected individuals. Three patients studied sequentially before and after therapy with niridazole developed positive lymphocyte responses to parasite antigens within the first month of treatment, but this enhanced responsiveness was not accompanied by clearance of these humoral supressive elements, which persisted in the patients' plasmas. Such suppressive factors which are specific for responses to parasite antigens probably form one of the mechanisms which determine the state of partial immunosuppression found in patients with chronic schistosome infection.",Immunology

Pronounced enhancement of lipid peroxidation during ischemia was seen in all subcellular fractions, particularly in the mitochondrial one. The results are consistent with low resistance of the liver and specifically its mitochondria to ischemia. Activation of lipid peroxidation corresponded with changes in the lipid composition. Decrease in the level of total and readily oxidizable lipids (cardiolipin) and accumulation of poorly oxidizable phospholipids (sphingomyelin) and highly toxic lysophosphatides were recorded.

At neutral and slightly alkaline pH values its molecular weight was about 142 000 (protomer) while at pH 5 it was mainly in the form of a tetramer with a molecular weight value of about 560 000. Samples of Glycoprotein II were shown by isoelectric focusing, molecular sieve chromatography and immunochemical methods to be microheterogenous. A number of fractions were prepared by these methods in which the proportion of the major subunits (alpha : gamma : delta) varied between 1 : 1 : 1 to 3 : 3 : 1. These ratios were also shown to change during development of the seed. On the basis of these results it is suggested that, at and above pH 7, samples of Glycoprotein II consist of microheterogenous population of molecules each containing three subunits per protomer. However, in these protomers the subunits are drawn, in different ratios, from the four subunits available. When the net molecular charge is small, at and around the isoelectric zone of Glycoptotein II, the protomer is converted mainly into the more stable tetramer containing 12 subunits.",Immunology

There are wide variations in the properties of the individual proteins and peptides as substrates for amine incorporation by the two transglutaminases. beta-Casein and several of its derivatives are excellent substrates for factor XIIIa. However, beta-casein is a relatively poor substrate for the liver enzyme. The primary site of amine incorporation by factor XIIIa in beta-casein was identified as glutamine 167. This was accomplished by labeling with fluorescent amine followed by proteolytic digestion and identification of labeled peptides. An 11-residue peptide and a 15-residue peptide, each containing 1 glutamine residue and each modeled after the primary site of amine incorporation in beta-casein, were prepared. A 13-residue peptide modeled after the primary crosslinking site in fibrin gamma chain was also prepared.

In the present study, lung function tests obtained in 74 regular marijuana smokers (duration of smoking > two-five years; frequency of smoking three days/week to several times/day) who denied intravenous narcotic drug abuse were compared with similar tests performed in two groups of control subjects. One group consisted of individuals tested in a mobile laboratory who were computer-matched to the marijuana smokers for anthropometric characteristics and quantity and duration of tobacco smoking; the other group was comprised of 41 nonsmokers of marijuana who were tested in the same laboratory as the marijuana smokers. Paired and unpaired t analyses revealed lower values for specific airway conductance (-0.07 to -0.08 +/- 0.02; P < 0.001) in the marijuana smokers compared with either group of control subjects, but no differences in spirometric indices, closing volume or delta N2 750-1250.

Urinary excretions of 16 neutral or basic amino acids were all increased on the third day. In comparison to pre-exposure values, the increased excretion of neutral or basic amino acids averaged 3.0-fold, and ranged from 1.2-fold (ornithine) to 7.3-fold (valine). Among the acidic amino acids and amides, only the excretion of glutamic acid was increased (4.6-fold), and the excretions of glutamine, aspartic acid and asparagine were reduced, respectively, to 3.8 percent, 64 percent, and 52 percent of the pre-exposure values. Urinary excretion of ammonia was greatly increased after exposure to nickel carbonyl. The alterations of urinary excretions of amino acids were apparently mediated by nephrotoxicity rather than by mobilization of amino acids from tissues, since plasma concentrations of amino acids were not significantly affected by exposure to nickel carbonyl. The pronounced diminution of glutamine excretion and the marked increase of ammonia excretion were consistent with enhanced renal production of ammonia from glutamine by action of glutaminase.",Immunology

7428149,"C-terminal parathyrin (parathyroid hormone) radioimmunoassay in serum with commercially available reagents. We describe a sequential double-antibody assay for measuring C-terminal parathyrin in serum with commercially available reagents. Intact bovine hormone, used as a working standard, is iodinated by conventional Chloramine T procedures. The antibody affinity is characteristic of high affinity binding (1.4 to 1.6 x 10(10) L/mol of intact parathyrin). The antibody also cross reacts with a C-terminal parathyrin fragment (amino acids 53-84) but not with a synthetic N-terminal parathyrin fragment (amino acids 1-34). The assay thus also measures both a C-terminal fragment of parathyrin and the intact hormone. The detection limit (250 ng/L; 500 int. units/L) is below the reference interval for healthy adults (430-1860 ng/L; 860-3720 int. units/L). Several commonly recognized problems with iodinated parathyrin are eliminated and accuracy and precision of the procedures for standard preparation and calibration are improved. Overall CV (between-run imprecision) is 10-17%. Analytical recovery is 80-90%, and C-terminal parathyrin measured in fresh sera and in sera stored for seven days at 30 degrees C is equivalent.",Immunology

A study was performed to determine the effect of colour vision defects and diabetic retinopathy on diabetic patients' ability to use a visual method of measuring their own blood glucose concentrations. Forty-eight diabetics whose colour vision and retinal status was assessed by an ophthalmologist carried out 311 blood glucose estimations using oxidase-peroxidase test strips which were then compared with laboratory values. There was a trend towards poor performance with advancing age but neither colour vision nor diabetic retinopathy had a significant effect on patients' ability to use this visual method of estimating blood glucose concentrations. The vast majority of diabetics who will benefit from being able to monitor their own blood glucose control should have no difficulty in using a visual method of testing, even if they do have defects of colour vision.",Immunology

Twenty of the patients with pulmonary involvement had histoplasmomas treated by wedge resection (18) or lobectomy (2). Twenty-two of the 27 cavitary lesions were treated by lobectomy and 4 by segmental resection, and 1 required pneumonectomy. The patients with mediastinal granulomas or fibrosis underwent exploration for diagnosis and curative or palliative procedures. Two patients with pericardial histoplasmosis required pericardial windows to relieve acute tamponade. One patient with disseminated histoplasmosis required aortic valve replacement for histoplasmosis valvulitis with severe regurgitation. The 1 operative death was a patient requiring pneumonectomy for mediastinal histoplasmosis. Indications for operative intervention in pulmonary histoplasmosis included resection of a new or enlarging pulmonary nodule to provide a definite pathological diagnosis and resection of persistent thick-walled pulmonary cavities. Mediastinal granuloma with or without fibrosis required exploration for diagnosis, palliation, or cure.

7419738,"Cell types and synaptic organization of the medullary electromotor nucleus in a constant frequency weakly electric fish, Sternarchus albifrons. The medullary electromotor nucleus (EMN) of Sternarchus albifrons was studied at the light and electron microscopic levels. The EMN consists of a dense meshwork of myelinated axons and glial elements with interposed large neurons; it is provided with an abundant supply of capillaries. Two types of essentially adrendritic nerve cells were distinguished on the basis of size: giant neurons (approx. 70 micrometers in diameter) and large neurons (approx. 30 micrometers in diameter). Their population ratio is 1:4. Only giant cells are labelled following the injection of retrograde tracer into the spinal cord; they are therefore identified with the so-called ""relay cells"" of other gymnotids. Tracer experiments further suggest that the descending axons of these relay cells give off collateral branches throughout the elongated spinal electromotor nucleus. In contrast, the large cells remain unlabelled and therefore lack spinal projections; they most likely correspond to ""pacemaker cells."" The perikaryal surface, including axon hillock and proximal part of initial segment of both types of EMN cells, is contacted by clusters of synaptic terminals and astrocytic processes. Two main varieties of synaptic terminals occur: (1) large endings and (2) ordinary end feet with standard size (S-type) and variable size (Sv-type) clear, spherical vesicles. The junction between large endings and EMN cells is characterized by the combination of gap junctions and surrounding intermediate junctions whose freeze-fracture characteristics were morphometrically analyzed. The large endings were formed by nodes of Ranvier as well as by fiber terminations, and synchronization within the EMN may be achieved by presynaptic fibers. Some of the contacts occur directly on the initial segment, which could allow activity to bypass the soma. It is concluded that the elctromotor system of Sternarchus is comprised of a rapid conduction pathway where medullary pacemaker and relay cells as well as spinal electromotor neurons are coupled by synapses with gap junctions. In contrast to the spinal electromotor neurons, the medullary EMN cells receive synapses with morphological characteristics of chemical transmission, and the S-type and SV-type terminals may possibly correspond to Gray's Type I and Type II synapses, respectively. These synapses may be involved in modulation of the electric organ discharge frequency.",Immunology
7419736,"Topology of ascending brainstem projections to nucleus parabrachialis in the cat. The afferent projections to nucleus parabrachialis (NPB) and nearby pontine areas from the lower brainstem were studied in cats using retrograde horseradish peoxidase (HRP) and anterograde autoradiographic tracing techniques. Two groups of medullary neurons send major projections to NPB and the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus (KF): 1) the solitary complex, especially the medial nucleus of the solitary tract (SM), nearby smaller cells of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) and the commissural nucleus; and 2) the lateral tegmental field (FTL), or parvocellular reticular formation. Autoradiographic tracing from these areas demonstrated terminal fields in NPB/KF and emphasized a ventrolateral route to NPB from both sources, with axons ascending between the facial nerve and superior olive and passing rostral to the trigeminal nuclei. Minor projections to NBPB/KF originate in the ventrolateral nucleus of the solitary tract, area subpostrema, the alaminar spinal trigeminal nucleus, the gigantocellular and magnocellular tegmental fields, and an area dorsal to the ipsilateral inferior olive. Topographical features of the major projections were studied by correlating the locus of overlap of injection sites with the locations of HRP-positive cells. Medial areas of SM/DMV project mostly to medial parts of NPB, while lateral areas near the solitary tract project to lateral parts of NPB and KF. Crossing projections from SM/DMV favor dorsolateral NPB and KF. FTL neurons in dorsomedial areas project more to medial NPB, and ventrolateral areas project to lateral NPB/KF. Using a new coordinate system to locate and normalize the positions of FTL neurons, data from many brains were collated. FTL cells projecting to NPB/KF were found to be on discrete longitudinal sheets, running radially with respect to the fourth ventricle. This substructure and related evidence suggest a preferred pattern for neuroanatomical connections and information processing in the lateral reticular areas of the brainstem, and help in understanding the topography of the projections to NPB/KF.",Immunology
7419714,"Production, degradation, and circulating levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in health and in chronic glucocorticoid excess. The decreased intestinal absorption of calcium and accelerated bone loss associated with chronic glucocorticoid excess may be mediated by changes in vitamin D metabolism, leading to decreased availability of circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. This hypothesis was examined in 14 patients with either endogenous or exogenous glucocorticoid excess. Analysis of paired serum samples (mean +/- SE) in 13 patients during euglucocorticoidism and during hyperglucocorticoidism showed that glucocorticoid excess resulted in small decreases of plasma 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentrations (22 +/- 2- 18 +/- 2 ng/ml; P < 0.05) but no significant changes in plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (32 +/- 8- 23 +/- 6 pg/ml) or serum immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (21 +/- 2- 18 +/- 2 muleq/ml). Additionally, we studied plasma kinetics of [3H]1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 after intravenous bolus administration in 10 hyperglucocorticoid patients and in 14 normal controls. Assessment with a three-compartment model showed no significant abnormalities in production rates (hyperglucocorticoid patients 1.2 +/- 0.3 micrograms/d, controls 1.5 +/- 0.2 micrograms/d) or metabolic clearance rates (hyperglucocorticoid patients, 18 +/- 2%; controls, 14 +/- 2%) or feces (hyperglucocorticoid patients, 60 +/- 9%, controls, 54 +/- 6%). We conclude that glucocorticoid excess does not effect plasma levels, production, or degradation of 1,25(OH)2D in humans. Thus, other mechanisms must be postulated to explain satisfactorily the abnormalities of bone structure and intestinal calcium absorption that may occur after chronic glucocorticoid therapy.",Immunology

A method was devised to sample cerebrospinal fluid (c.s.f.) from the third ventricle of conscious rabbits.2. Levels of PGE were measured in c.s.f. withdrawn from the third ventricle of rabbits exposed to a variety of manipulations of both brain and body core temperatures which mimicked various facets of fever in these animals. These results were compared to the levels of PGE in the c.s.f. of the same rabbits made febrile by I.V. injections of endogenous pyrogen.3. Levels of PGE in ventricular c.s.f. remained unaltered at 2-3 ng/ml. during exposure to cold, hyperthermia due to heat exposure, hypothalamic cooling or hypothalamic heating, whereas during fever produced by endogenous pyrogen, they rose to an average of 11-12 ng/ml. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was established between the level of PGE measured in the c.s.f. and the subsequent height of the fever produced by the pyrogen.4. Since production of PGE within the brain is not caused by changes in the brain or body temperatures which are comparable to those observed during fever, and yet greater than fivefold increases in the PGE levels in c.s.f. are produced by I.V. injections of endogenous pyrogen, it is concluded that PGE production in the brain is involved in the pathogenesis of fever.",Immunology

The normal ventricular response to exercise was at least a 5% absolute increase in the ejection fraction of either ventricle. In patients the predominant cardiac abnormality involved performance of the right ventricle. Right ventricular ejection fraction was abnormal at rest in eight patients. Twenty-three patients demonstrated an abnormal right ventricular response to submaximal exercise. Airway obstruction and arterial hypoxemia were significantly more severe in patients with abnormal right ventricular exercise reserve than in those with normal reserve.

At different time after administration of tritium-labelled amino acids, in field 17 of the optic cortex, the label was detected in all hypohalamic areas except the ventromedial nucleus. This phenomenon, while supporting and verifying our previous investigations, demonstrates that there exist some direct spatial organizaional bilateral cortico-hypothalamic connections. Normal ultrastructure of the synaptic contacts was studied by means of electron radioautography. Advantages and disadvantages of the radioautographic method are discussed and compared to some modern methods of anterograde degeneration applied for investigating connections in the CNS.

Infusion of EGTA resulted in an increase of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and infusion of CaCl2, in a decrease of this hormone. The PT glands excised either at the beginning or at the end of the infusions were examined by electron microsoopy. After infusion of EGTA, activated cells showed a dense matrix, prominent Golgi apparatus, rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) with narrow cisternae, and an incrased tortuosity of the plasma membrane, accompanied by an enlargement of the intercellular spaces. Infusion of CaCl2 resulted in a distention of the rER cisternae, disorganization of the Golgi apparatus and a decreased tortuosity of the plasma membrane.

Based on the secretion cycle proposed by Roth and Capen [1974], they were referred to as active cells. Light chief cells had an electronlucent cytoplasm, inconspicuous rER and Golgi apparatus. They were referred to as inactive cells in resting stages or in stages of transition between active and inactive forms or vice versa. In neonatal dogs, dark chief cells were similar to those in growing and adult dogs and light chief cells had the features of the cells referred to as cells in transitional stages. There were no cells in resting stages. The morphological findings suggest that PT activity in growing dogs was similar to that in adult dogs, whereas in neonatal dogs it was different; this may be related to the animal's developmental status or to changes in serum calcium concentration after birth.",Immunology

The former were smokers who experienced their strongest need to smoke in low-arousal situations characterized by, e.g., monotony and low-level stimulation, while the latter experienced their strongest need to smoke in high-arousal situations characterized by anxiety and high-level stimulation. Behavioral measures of decision time and movement time were examined together with tonic and phasic measures of skin conductance and heart rate during noise and in response to a single high intensity 100 db (A) auditory tone. Relative to a noise-free condition, noise significantly impaired decision time of smokers and this was paralleled by autonomic rsponse measures to tone stimulation which were reflective of less efficient defensive response mechanisms to aversive stimulation.

7408936,"Active and passive re-expression of Fc gamma receptors on human lymphocytes. Modulation of receptors for IgG (Fc gamma R) on human lymphocytes was induced by the interaction with erythrocyte-IgG antibody (EAG) complexes followed by incubation at 37 degrees C. The re-expression of Fc gamma R could be achieved by two independent processes. (a) Active synthesis, susceptible to inhibition by puromycin or cycloheximide was shown to peak 4 to 6 h after removal of EAG complexes; it required addition of at least 2% fetal calf serum. (b) Insertion of soluble Fc gamma R into the membrane of modulated lymphocytes was shown to occur within 20 min of contact between cells and Fc gamma R-containing supernatants; it was not altered by protein synthesis inhibitors. Fc gamma R-like material, spontaneously released by unstimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes or by polymorphonuclear cells, was taken up by modulated lymphocytes. This soluble material was fully absorbed on polymerized human IgG; it was non-dialyzable, thermolabile (56 degrees C, 30 min) and partially destroyed by freezing and thawing; it was recovered as two broad peaks from chromatography on polyacrylamide gel; it was shown to bind to both T and non-T Fc gamma R-bearing lymphocytes capable of forming EAG rosettes before modulation; and it could be inserted into allogeneic lymphocytes. These results remonstrate that the Fc gamma R structure bears two active sites, one binding to the Fc gamma and the other to the surface of EAG rosette-forming cells. Rapid release of soluble Fc gamma R from the cells and their possible insertion into the membrane may have important implications with respect to the biological functions associated with these receptors.",Immunology

7408881,"The optimal efficiency and the economic degrees of coupling of oxidative phosphorylation. A phenomenological theory considering the output characteristics of oxidative phosphorylation has been worked out by adopting the formalism of linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics. The linearity of oxidative phosphorylation in the range of the output forces of practical interest has been experimentally verified. the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation is zero if either a load with a zero conductance (open-circuited situation) or a load with an infinite conductance (short-circuited situation) is attached to oxidative phosphorylation. In between these extreme conductances there exists a finite load conductance permitting oxidative phosphorylation to operate with optimal efficiency. The necessary and sufficient condition for optimal efficiency was found to be L33/L11 = square root 1 - q2 where L11 is the phenomenological conductance of phosphorylation, L33 the phenomenological conductance of the load and q the degree of coupling of oxidative phosphorylation driven by respiration. This condition was called conductance matching. Under the condition of conductance matching, four output functions of oxidative phosphorylation of practical interest were optimized. A maximal net rate of oxidative phosphorylation occurs at a degree of coupling qf = 0.78. A maximal output power of oxidative phosphorylation, i.e. net rate times established phosphate potential, resuls at qp = 0.91. The maximization of the function net rate times efficiency yielded an economic degree of coupling qfec = 0.95 for maximal ATP flow. Finally, maximization of the function output power times efficiency led to a degree of coupling qpec = 0.97. This last function simultaneously maximized net rate of ATP production, developed phosphate potential and efficiency and reflects therefore the most economic solution to the output problem under the condition of conductance matching. In isolated rat livers perfused in a metabolic resting state, the condition of conductance matching is fulfilled. In addition, the degree of coupling oxidative phosphorylation under these conditions corresponds to the economic degree of coupling qpec.",Immunology

Catecholestrogens are biologically active metabolites of estrogen which are synthesized by estrogen-2-hydroxylase in the liver, brain, and other organs. Although catecholestrogens are inactivated by enzymatic O-methylation, demethylation of the 2-methoxyestrogens to reform catecholestrogens also occurs. A sensitive and specific radioenzymatic assay for rat liver 2-methoxyestrogen demethylase has been developed which makes it possible to characterize its substrate requirements and to study the influence of various hormones on catecholestrogen formation. 2-Methoxyestrogen demethylase activity is localized in rat liver microsomes. The apparent Km for 2-methoxyestrone (2MeOE1) is 12 muM and that for 2-methoxyestradiol (2MeOE2) is 3 umM. The two most prevalent 2-methoxyestrogens, 2MeOE1 and 2 MeOE2, appear to be demethylated by different enzymes. The enzymes have absolute requirements for NADPH, an their activities are inhibited by CO and SKF-525A, indicating that they are cytochrome P450 dependent. 2MeOE2 demethylation but not 2MeOE1 demethylation exhibits substrate inhibition. 2MeOE1 demethylase activity in the female rat liver is only one third that in the male rat liver, but sexual dimorphism was not found in 2MeOE2 demethylation.

The cardiorespiratory patterns of hemorrhage and trauma patients who did not develop ARDS were compared to those who subsequently did develop ARDS, but before the time of their ARDS. Comparisons also were made in the patients with trauma and those with hemorrhage, as well as in those who survived and those who did not. Hemorrhage and trauma patients who developed ARDS had greater reductions in blood volume, red cell mass, PaCO2 and O2 delivery throughout all stages, as well as greater pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) and pH in the early and middle stages. Nonsurvivors of ARDS had greater deficits in blood volume and red cell mass, higher PVRI and pH, as well as lower central venous pressure (CVP), hemoglobin (Hgb), and PaCO2 than did ARDS survivors. Hemorrhage patients had lower blood volume, left ventricular function, O2 delivery and VO2, as well as higher systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), PVRI, and O2 extraction than either the trauma patients or normal subjects. Description of the temporal cardiorespiratory patterns before the clinical appearance of ARDS showed the progressive appearance of these deficits beginning 36 h before the hypoxemia was observed. The data are consistent with the concept that ARDS after hemorrhage and trauma is preceded by hypovolemia, reduced myocardial performance, inadequate O2 delivery, and inadequate O2 extraction needed to maintain VO2 at the elevated levels demanded by the increased metabolic requirements of the injured patients. Thus, the so-called shock lung is a complication of shock associated with hypovolemia, hypoxemia, and inadequate cardiac compensatory responses to increasesd O2 demands.",Immunology

In a few cases, personal effects must have been taken from locations near a remains because four bags were found to contain identifiable personal effects that did not match the remains with the same number. therefore, personal effects were utilized less frequently than might normally occur in the course of such investigations. Thorough searches of each remains, especially X-ray, yielded additional effects during the investigation at Dover.

Lung volumes (FVC1, FEV1.0 and peak flow) were measured in 403 men and 561 women volunteers for fitness testing, using the SRL automated spirometer system. Average scores for this population were 5--10% higher than predicted from age, height and sex using either the formulae inherent in the SRL computer or standards proposed by Anderson et al. [1968] for the Toronto population; existing standards may thus underestimate respiratory potential. Lung function data showed a dose-dependent decrease within the category of cigarette smokers, but there was no significant difference between average results for smokers and non-smokers. Multivariate analysis showed significant contributions of lean mass and obesity to the overall description of lung volumes; however, effects were not large enough to justify incorporation of such variables into routine prediction equations. Positive responses to the respiratory section of the Cornell Medical Index were in several instances associated with below expected lung volumes. The most consistent response was to the question 'do you suffer from asthma?' Although the average effect was significant, the magnitude of response (10--20%) would have been overlooked in individual testing; this suggests that there may be more scope for pulmonary screening through the improvement of questionnaires than through the purchase of expensive electronic spirometers.",Immunology

Some of these proteins are identical in amino acid sequence or differ only slightly. Various structural studies have shown that the heavy and light chains of myosin are also homologous in skeletal and cardiac muscles. In developing skeletal muscles, certain myosin subunits are present which are not found in the corresponding adult muscle. Whether fetal cardiac muscle also contains myosin subunits homologous to these early forms is not known. We now report that ventricular myosin of fetal rats has a light chain polypeptide corresponding to the skeletal muscle embryonic light chain. This result provides further evidence that a form of myosin light chain, not detectable in adult skeletal or ventricular myosin, is characteristic of the early stages of striated muscle development.",Immunology

7407880,"Ultrastructural alterations associated with the initiation of follicular atresia. To identify and describe ovarian follicles committed to undergo follicular degeneration (atresia), immature rats were primed with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG). After PMSG treatment, preovulatory follicles develop but subsequently degenerate. Prior to the appearance of pyknotic nuclei (Stage I of atresia), degenerative changes were observed in focal areas of the granulosa cell layer. These changes include ""blebbing"" of the cytoplasm and alterations in the shape of the granulosa cells. The appearance of these degenerative changes coincides with a decrease in ovarian concentrations of estradiol and testosterone. Since estrogens and androgens maintain the follicle, the decline in estradiol and testosterone could be responsible for the further degenerative alterations that lead to complete deterioration of the preovulatory follicle. In Stage I atretic follicles, lysosome-derived autophagic vacuoles develop and macrophages invade both the thecal and granulosa cell layers. The combined actions of the autophagic vacuoles and macrophages could destroy both the granulosa-cell and thecal layers and thereby transform the preovulatory follicle into an ovarian cyst.",Immunology

Unilateral DA denervation was confirmed by the marked loss of fluorescent fibers in mesolimbic DA terminal fields in brains processed for catecholamine histofluorescence with the glyoxylic acid-paraformaldehyde method. Such unilateral DA denervation significantly decreased the locomotor exploration of an open field and the locomotor response to d-amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg). These results demonstrate that unilateral mesolimbococortical DA denervation is sufficient, and that bilateral denervation of a single amphetamine or a decrease of locomotion in the open field.

The teleostean cerebellar cortex has been studied with respect to its cytoarchitectonic arrangement and intracortical neuronal circuits. Samples of fish cerebellum were fixed either by immersion of vascular perfusion in 5% glutaraldehyde solution and processed for light and scanning electron microscopy. The cerebellar cortex shows four distinct layers: granular; fibrous stratum; Purkinje cell; and molecular layers. In the granular layer, mossy and climbing fiber glomeruli were characterized. The mossy glomerular region appeared as polygonal, round or ovoid clews formed by the convergence of up to 17 dendritic profiles upon a thick mossy fiber branch. The ""en passant"" nature of mossy fiber-granule cell dendrite synaptic relationship was clearly appreciated. The climbing fibers showed tendril and glomerular collaterals. The latter form thin, elongated glomeruli. Remnants of a neuroglial envelope were observed in the mossy fiber glomeruli but are apparently absent from the climbing fiber glomeruli. The beaded-shape Golgi cell axonal ramifications were observed participating in the formation of both glomerular types. Velate protoplasmic astrocytes and oligodendrocytes were also identified. The fibrous stratum appeared to be formed by compact bundles of thick and think myelinated axons, running horizontally beneath the Purkinje cell layer and apparently belonging to ascending climbing fibers and descending Purkinje cell axons. At the Purkinje cell layer a selective removal of Bergmann glial cells was observed allowing the visualization of the pericellular basket and the pinceaux.

The anteromedial node is formed by the network that consists of connective tissue fibres of fascial cases covering the lumboinguinal and pectinate muscles and the common sheaths for the artery and vein. The anterolateral node is formed by the network that consists of the connective tissue fibres of the rectal muscle case, the sheaths of the lateral vessels circumflexing the femur and fasciae of the musculus sartorius and m. tensor fasciae femoris. The posteroinferior node is formed by the network that consists of the connective tissue fibres of the fascial cases of the m. obturatorius, internal and external, fascial sheaths of the internal pudendal vessels and the ischiadic nerve.

There is no documentation in the literature of the risk of hypoxemia after chest percussion in acutely ill adults with nonsurgical pulmonary disorders. We studied the immediate effect of postural drainage and chest percussion (PDP) on oxygenation in 22 hospitalized patients with a variety of acute, nonsurgical pulmonary disorders. Heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and arterial blood gas levels were measured at four points before, during, and after PDP. There was a significant fall in PaO2 after chest percussion in ten patients who produced no sputum or small amounts of mucoid sputum. The mean PaO2 fell 16.8 mm Hg (P < 0.05) immediately after PDP, when compared to the value obtained after postural drainage alone, and had fallen another 5.3 mm Hg (P < 0.01) 30 minutes after return to the pretreatment position. There was no significant change in PaO2 in 12 patients who produced moderate to large amounts of mucopurulent secretions. The fall in PaO2 was probably due to increased ventilation-perfusion mismatch since this fall was avoided in two patients restudied while receiving 100 percent oxygen.

Samples were drawn from properly placed pulmonary arterial catheters with the balloon deflated. Physiologic stability was documented at the beginning and end of the sampling period in all but one patient. Results in each patient demonstrated a close grouping of values for SVO2 obtained at the five rates of withdrawal (largest standard deviation, 1.9 percent). Evaluations by paired t-test comparing all rates of withdrawal with the slowest rate (1 ml/min) showed no significant differences. The rate of withdrawal of the sample is not associated with significant errors in SVO2 when samples are drawn from a properly positioned pulmonary arterial catheter.",Immunology

Functional interconnections between pairs of neurons were studied with cross-correlation techniques. A total of 40 neuronal pairs were studied, 38 of which were recorded on separate, but proximal electrodes, and two pairs of which were recorded on the same electrode. Of the 40 pairs of neurons examined, 22 showed short delay (< 4 msec) peaks in the cross correlogram of their spike activity. These correlations tended to be highest in quiet sleep (QS). Increased probability of shared discharge with intermediate delays in the peaks of the cross-correlogram (5-150 msec) was observed in 16 of 40 pairs. The increase in correlation at intermediate delays followed a period of decreased shared activity.

It was prolonged in hypertension (p < 0.001), HOCM (p < 0.001), in aortic stenosis (p < 0.05), and aortic incompetence (p < 0.001), and was shortened in congestive cardiomyopathyl (p < 0.05) and mitral stenosis (p < 0.01). In patients with coronary artery disease and normal over-all systolic LV function, IRP was prolonged (p < 0.001); IRP was shortened in four patients with coronary disease who had severe LV dysfunction and severe additional mitral incompetence. IRP was related to systemic blood pressure, percentage shortening of the LV in systole, and to the mitral EF slope.

The phases of the nitrogen washout curve (NWC): dead space phase (DSP), mixed phase (MP), alveolar phase (AP) and lung closing volume (LCV) were studied in 7 healthy subjects and 47 patients with diverse disorders of gas mixing in the lungs. Under conditions of a diffuse decrease in the elasticity induced by blood congestion consequent on mitral heart disease, the gas in uniformly mixed in the lungs so that the magnitudes of NWC phases (in % of ZCV) almost do not differ from normal. When ZCV was drastically decreased, DSP showed a relative augmentation, while AP fell down. In local ventilation disorders induced by pulmonary diseases (bronchoectasis, abscesses, etc.), NWC patterns demonstrated significant changes indicating a non-uniform gas mixing in the lungs. LCV was well identifiable in healthy subjects whereas in patients with heart diseases, it was more poorly and less frequently identifiable, especially in subjects with pulmonary diseases. An increase in the time of diffuse gas mixing, which was attained as a result of breath holding at the height of inspiration, leads to the reduced DSP magnitude and gas supply to the alveoli.

A fitting method for saturation curves is described that may be applied to any kind of ligand binding process, regardless of whether positive, negative or mixed cooperativity is involved. The procedure yields 'best values' of maximal saturation (or maximal velocity with enzymes); in addition, an empirical function is calculated that represents the concentration dependence of the Hill slope (i.e. the slope of the corresponding Hill plot). Since the method does not require the maximal saturation to be known in advance, it can be successfully applied to systems which, due to experimental limitations, may not be saturated with ligand. It is shown that in these cases values of maximal saturation are obtained that are considerably more reliable than those estimated by customary methods. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the concentration dependence of the Hill slope, the other main result of the proposed procedure, may offer useful evidence as to the molecular events leading to non-hyperbolicity and thus provide a rational basis for selecting more specific models to describe the properties of the system studied.",Immunology
7407160,"Similar effect of proteolipid apoproteins from human myelin (lipophilin) and bovine white matter on the lipid phase transition. The proteolipid apoprotein from bovine white matter has been reported to increase the phase transition temperature of dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine, in contrast to a proteolipid apoprotein fraction from human myelin, called lipophilin, which decreases the enthalpy without altering the phase transition temperature. Since these results lead to different conclusions concerning the structure and amount of boundary lipid surrounding these proteins, the effects of the two proteins on the phase transition of dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine were compared. Neither protein has any effect on the phase transition temperature, regardless of the method of delipidation of the protein, the amount of residual lipid, the method of incorporation into vesicles, or heating rates used for differential scanning calorimetry. However, a higher melting component was observed when decomposition of the lipid to lysophosphatidylcholine had occurred. Addition of as little as 6% of the decomposition products of dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine, lysodimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine and myristic acid, is enough to produce a higher-temperature peak. The intensity of this peak increases with increasing protein concentration similar to the reported result on the bovine white matter proteolipid. The question as to whether the protein-induced decrease in enthalpy is due to boundary lipid or entrapment of lipid in protein aggregates was also addressed by studying the appearance of the intramembranous protein particles by freeze-fracture electron microscopy at temperatures above and below the phase transition and between the premelt and main transitions. The protein is randomly dispersed above the phase transition. At low concentrations, below the phase transition, it clusters, forming particle-free and particle-rich areas, but does not aggregate. At higher concentrations it is randomly dispersed below the premelt and main transition but is clustered between the premelt and main transition. Since the protein is more randomly dispersed above the transition than below, the reduction in enthalpy of the freezing transition was compared to that of the melting transition and was found to be identical, suggesting that the withdrawal of lipid from the phase transition is probably not due to lipid entrapment but due to the formation of a boundary lipid interface between the protein and the bulk lipid.",Immunology

Microtubules from suspension cultures of HeLa cells have been purified by carrying them through four complete cycles of polymerization at 37 degrees C and depolymerization at 4 degrees C. These microtubules show, in addition to the major alpha- and beta-tubulin components, major proteins with molecular weights of 201 000-206 000 (comprising 4.5% of the total protein), proteins with molecular weights of 97 000, 100 000, 104 000, and 114 000 (together comprising approximately 2% of the total protein), and minor components with molecular weights of 68 000 and 151 000. HeLa microtubules have also been reconstituted from purified HeLa tubulin and proteins from HeLa microtubules separated from tubulin by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. Experiments on the fractionation and reconstitution of both two- and four-cycle microtubules suggest that the 201 000-206 000-dalton proteins are incorporated into microtubules and promote tubulin polymerization. Microtubules formed by fractionationand reconstitution of two-cycle microtubules also contain several other proteins with molecular weights of 132 000, 146 000, 151 000, 160 000, and 284 000, although these are not present in microtubules carried through four assembly-disassembly cycles. Evidence is also presented which shows that a 68 000-dalton protein which is a prominent component of HeLa microtubules after two polymerization-depolymerization cycles does not stoichiometrically copurify with tubulin through repeated assembly--disassembly cycles and does not stimulate tubulin polymerization. On the other hand, the sedimentation of this 68 000-dalton protein is apparently influenced by the presence of polymerized microtubules, suggesting that this protein may be a component of a system whjich interacts weakly with microtubules. Finally, evidence is presented suggesting that two-cycle microtubules contain a proteolytic activity that can digest the 201 000-206 000-dalton proteins.",Immunology
7407074,"Phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance of bovine platelets. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of bovine platelets at 28 degrees C display prominent peaks from adenine nucleotides in two different environments, the metabolic and storage pools. Addition of 20 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose and 0.1 mM 2,4-dinitrophenol depletes metabolic ATP, resulting in loss of nucleotide signals at 5, 10, and 19 ppm and leaving peaks at 6.5, 10.5, and 19 ppm that are assigned primarily to the dense granule storage pool. The ATP/ADP concentration ratio of the remaining pools is 1.9 +/- 0.2, with chemical shifts which reflect a more acidic environment for the intragranular nucleotides than for the cytosol. Isolated bovine dense granules give spectra with similar peak positions to those ascribed to the storage pool after metabolic depletion of whole cells. Storage pool nucleotide spectra are highly temperature dependent. Below 20 degrees C, the beta-ATP peak broadens and decreases in area to the point that it is almost undetectable at 0 degrees C, probably reflecting formation of progressively higher molecular weight aggregates at the lower temperatures. The release reaction was followed by 31P NMR after addition of thrombin at 28 degrees C. Spectra of the cell suspension taken at 5-min intervals were compared to spectra of perchloric acid extracts produced in parallel. A new finding of these experiments is that the released nucleotides rapidly undergo a transition to a ""NMR silent"" form as part of the bovine platelet release reacton. Metabolic breadkdown and external paramagnetic ion interactions did not explain the loss of signal from the storage pool. During release reaction, the nucleotides may be broadened out beyond detection due to immobilization by divalent cation and/or platelet membrane binding.",Immunology
7407065,"Calorimetric investigation of the complex phase behavior of glucocerebroside dispersions. The thermotropic behavior of aqueous dispersions of glucocerebroside from Gaucher's spleen has been investigated by different scanning calorimetry. These results indicate that glucocerebroside undergoes two distinct phase transitions centered at 47 and 83 degrees C, respectively. The high-temperature transition is associated with the main gel-liquid crystalline transition and has an enthalpy change of 13.6 kcal/mol of lipid; this transition is not rapidly reversible and the liquid crystalline phase supercools to a metastable gel phase. The low-temperature transition is exothermic with an enthalpy change of -6.3 kcal/mol and involves a transformation of the metastable gel phase to a more highly ordered gel conformation, without involving changes in the conformational state of the hydrocarbon chains. The behavior of these transitions as a function of the amount of water suggests that the origin of the metastability is related to a hydration-dehydration process of the cerebroside molecule. Experiments with synthetic-D-erythro-N-palmitoylglucocerebroside revealed the same thermotropic behavior. These glucocerebroside transitions are irreversible and together define a unidirectional cycle in which each state of the molecule can only be reached by completing the entire cycle.",Immunology

The chick neural cell adhesion molecule, CAM, is a cell-surface protein specific to the nervous system and has been implicated in cell adhesion among cells and neurites of the developing retina and brain. Previous studies have shown that F(ab') fragments of antibodies directed against CAM inhibit the in vitro aggregation of cells obtained from 9-day embryonic chick retina. The specific antibody fragments also reduce the diameter of neurite fascicles that grow out from cultured dorsal root ganglia, apparently by blocking side-to-side adhesion between the neurites. In addition, anti-CAM antibodies alter the appearance of histotypic patterns in retinal cell aggregates maintained in culture for several days. We now demonstrate that the antibodies can disrupt histogenesis of the developing retina in organ culture, strengthening the notion that the cell-cell adhesion properties mediated by CAM are involved in the normal development of histological layers in the chick retina.",Immunology

Antibodies to colchicine have been prepared by injecting rabbits with an antigen prepared by coupling deacetylcolchicine to bovine serum albumin with a water-soluble carbodiimide. Sera of high titer were obtained with apparent dissociation constants for colchicine ranging from 5 to 17 nM. Binding was rapid and occurred at low temperatures. The chemical specificity of the binding site(s) resembled that in tubulin for the A and B rings of colchicine. Unlike tubulin, the antibody binding site tolerated numerous changes in the tropolone moiety (C ring). In contrast to tubulin, binding of colchicine to the antibody site did not promote fluorescence. The colchicine binding capacity of the antibody was high enough to prevent colchicine fluorescence in the presence of tubulin and to restore polymerization in colchicine-inhibited tubulin preparations.",Immunology

Asymmetry is lower than in other Amerindian and Eskimo groups reported to date, which accords with the adequacy and reliability of traditional food sources and complements the claim that protein intake is at or above minimum requirements. Partitioning the variation by sex, arcade, dimension, and tooth discloses several statistically significant effects. Among these: 1) females are proportionately more asymmetric than males; 2) maxillary teeth are more asymmetric than their mandibular counterparts; 3) the mesiodistal dimension is less canalized than buccolingual width in the maxilla, but is more asymmetric in the mandible; and 4) the pattern of asymmetry corresponds closely with the morphogenetic gradients within each tooth field, suggesting that bilaterality provides an additional measure for disclosing underlying genetic and ontogenetic patterns in the dentition.",Immunology

The influence of these two host parameters on the growth of neural transplants with high growth potential (tissue from 15-day-old embryos) and low growth potential (tissue from 18-day-old embryos) was investigated. Neocortical neural tissues of constant volume, obtained from 15- and 18-day-old embryos, were transplanted into the forebrain or cerebellum of 5-, 10-, 20-, 25-, 30-, 35- and 180-day-old host animals and analyzed, quantitatively well as qualitatively, 90 days after transplantation. The transplants grew larger in volume in the cerebellum than in the forebrain region of the hosts of all ages. In both sites, tissue from 15-day-old embryos yielded larger transplants than tissue from 18-day-old embryos. Transplants from 15-day-old embryos grew most extensively in 5-day-old host animals (33-fold in the cerebellum, and 23-fold in the forebrain region.) In older host animals it grew less extensively, and without much variation in size that could be attributed to the age of host animals. Tissue from 18-day-old embryos grew little, regardless of site of transplantation or age of host. Apparently the age of the host animals and the site of transplantation had greater influence on the growth of the neural transplants with high growth potential than on those with low growth potential.

Some 30 cases of tick-borne relapsing fever due to Borrelia are known to have occurred between 1965 and 1978 in the Pacific Northwest. This disease was found more frequently in young men with a history of wilderness exposure during the summer months. Recurrent fever was the most common symptom with temperatures reaching higher than 39.5 degrees C (103.1 degrees F) in all cases, and many patients had three or more febrile episodes. Splenomegaly was the second most common finding reported. Diagnosis of relapsing fever was made in 20 cases by identifying spirochetes on peripheral blood smears. In ten remaining cases the diagnosis was made on clinical and epidemiologic grounds.Information regarding therapy was available in 21 cases. Ten patients received a tetracycline drug and all had a prompt response without relapse. Two of the patients died, a 68-year-old woman with possible myocardial involvement and a newborn infant with infection acquired in utero and meningeal involvement. The diagnosis was often delayed in spite of outpatient evaluation and admittance to hospital, probably because borreliosis was not considered in the differential diagnosis. Because tick-borne relapsing fever is eventually a self-limited disease in most patients, it is probably not recognized often enough. Awareness of this disease and examination of the peripheral blood smear for spirochetes will lead to earlier diagnosis. Prompt initiation of tetracycline therapy should reduce morbidity associated with borreliosis.",Immunology

Diffuse cerebral ischemia was created in pentobarbital-anesthetized cats by basilar and bilateral carotid artery occlusions and hypotension. Local cerebral blood flow (ICBF) was assessed autoradiographically with 14C-antipyrine, and local cerebral glucose utilization with 14C-2-deoxyglucose. In animals without glucose pretreatment, 15 min of ischemia led to a homogeneous reduction of post-ischemic cerebral perfusion to 31% of control; ischemia of 30 min produced post-ischemic perfusion heterogeneities in the cerebral cortex and deep gray structures. In animals pretreated with dextrose, 1.5 gm/kg intravenously, heterogeneous cerebral perfusion was observed following only 15 min of ischemia, and a severe global impairment of cerebral reperfusion occurred after the 30 min insult. Deoxyglucose autoradiograms in the latter animals were remarkable for a complete suppression of tracer uptake in the cerebral cortex and a paradoxically increased tracer concentration in the cerebral white matter. Mean plasma glucose in the treated animals exceeded 1000 mg/100 ml. Large glucose loads prior to ischemia dramatically impair post-ischemic cerebral perfusion.",Immunology

The steroidogenic responsiveness of human thecal tissue to different doses of LH was investigated in vitro in relation to the health of the follicle and to the responsiveness of stromal tissue. The results show that small incremental increases in LH, over a low range of concentrations (1 to 10 ng/ml), markedly increased the thecal output of androstenedione from healthy and/or atretic follicles. Theca from healthy follicles were also stimulated to increase their output of progesterone and estradiol in response to small increases in LH whereas theca from atretic follicles produced more variable amounts of progesterone and were unable to generate estradiol. In contrast, relatively high concentrations of LH (50 ng/ml) reduced the total steroid output from the theca of both healthy and atretic follicles while 'switching on' a low level of steroidogenesis in stromal tissue. These data suggest that the steroidogenic response of thecal tissue is related to the mass of tissue (i.e., the size of the follicle), the health of the follicle and the amount of LH to which it is exposed.",Immunology

The determination of the early peak of 14CO production that results from haem turnover after administration of glycine-2-14C was studied in patients with pernicious anaemia. The accuracy of this technique in measuring ineffective erythropoiesis was assessed by comparison with other measurements of the severity of the disease. 6 patients were studied before specific treatment and 2 of these also after treatment. The endogenous production of 14 CO was calculated from determinations of the production of CO by a rebreathing technique and of the specific activity of CO washed out from the body CO store by oxygen breathing. The early labelled peak was increased 7-39 times compared to that in healthy control subjects and represented 35-86% of the total production of 14CO as compared to 13% in controls. The early labelled peak was significantly correlated to the Hb concentration, mean red cell volume and endogenous production of CO. 2 patients, twice  examined, showed a moderately increased early labelled peak also after specific treatment. This was attributed to persistence of some ineffective erythropoiesis in 1 patient and possibly increased hepatic haem turnover in the other. The magnitude of the early labelled peak and the maximal activity of 14CO found in the samples of CO collected from the body CO store were significantly correlated. In conclusion, with the present method the early peak of 14CO reflected the ineffective erythropoiesis in patients with pernicious anaemia. The early labelled peak could be predicted from the maximal activity of 14CO found in the samples of CO washed out from the body CO store.",Immunology

A mechanism that we have proposed for bovine plasma amine oxidase predicts that under anaerobic conditions (single turnover) 1 mol of benzaldehyde and 1 mol of NH4+ are produced from benzylamine. Other works have reported experiments with amine oxidases from other sources that show that NH4+ is not released under anaerobic conditions. The amount of NH4+ and benzaldehyde released when plasma amine oxidase acts on benzylamine under anaerobic conditions has been determined to resolve this discrepancy. It was found that 1 mol of NH4+ and 1 mol of benzaldehyde are released per active site. This result is consistent with the mechanism that we have proposed but is inconsistent with other mechanisms that invoke pyridoxal as an active-site component of amine oxidase.,Immunology

Concentration-response curves obtained for contraction of goat rumen strips indicated that both bradykinin (BK) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine creatinin sulphate; 5-HT) are potent agents. Sodium meclofenamate antagonized the smooth muscle-stimulating action of BK; the 5-HT blocking agents xylamidine and methysergide diminished the contractile effects of 5-HT. The results indicated that the antagonisms are noncompetitive in nature. In vivo, both BK and 5-HT caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the rumen contraction sequences. The BK was the more potent of the two compounds. This inhibition was probably due to an increase in ruminal smooth muscle tone, resulting in reflex inhibition of the normal cyclical contraction sequences. In conscious goats, BK induced tachycardia, whereas 5-HT produced only minor changes in heart rate. Treatment with sodium meclofenamate or phenylbutazone prevented the BK-induced inhibition of rumen motility. Treatment with the 5-HT blocking agents only partly reduced the 5-HT-induced effects.",Immunology

In bacteriophage T4 DNA, transcription units recognized in vitro by host RNA polymerase consist of promotor-proximal 'immediate early' (IE) genes and promotor-distal 'delayed early' (DE) genes separated from each other by rho-dependent transcription terminators. In vivo, the transition from IE to DE transcription requires phage-specific protein synthesis and can be prevented by chloramphenicol (CAM). Most of the information about IE/DE transition has been obtained by hybridizaton analyses of mixtures of RNA species synthesized simultaneously on several T4 transcription units (for review see ref. 3). A useful model for the study of T4 gene expression at the level of primary transcripts and individual gene products is provided by the T4 tRNA operon, a cluster of genes coding for eight T4-specific transfer RNAs and two stable RNAs (species 1 and 2) of unknown function (Fig. 1). The 10 genes of the tRNA operon are arranged in two subclusters (I and II) with a promotor located about 1 kilobase pair upstream. The primary transcripts and the final gene products of this region have been identified and isolated. Moreover, this genetic region was recently cloned and a part of it sequenced. We describe here the expression of T4 tRNA genes in vivo and in vitro in terms of the IE/DE concept and demonstrate that the two subclusters of the tRNA operon are subject to different modes of control.",Immunology

Within the intermediate range between female and male controls, considerable interindividual variation was detected among the patients which could be due to least in part to biological variation. The findings permit the inference that the H-Y structural gene is not Y-linked, and support the assumptions of an X-linked gene escaping inactivation and of it controlling the expression of the H-Y structural gene. It is probable that the structural gene itself is autosomal. The results also suggest that male gonadal differentiation is dependent on a threshold level of H-Y antigen concentration.",Immunology

The effects of calcitonin (CT) on the cellular transport and accumulation of Ca were studied in bone cells grown in primary culture. The following sequence of events was detected: (1) After 1--2 h of incubation with CT the initial rate of Ca influx into bone cells transiently increased. A longer incubation with CT (3--24 h), caused a gradual decrease in the initial rate of Ca influx, reaching a level below the control at 24 h. (2) After 2 h incubation with CT, efflux studies revealer Ca pool and (b) an increase in the accumulation of Ca in the slow-turnover Ca pool. (3) After 30 min of incubation with CT the amount of Ca in bone cells gradually increased and remained at a higher level for up to 24 h incubation with CT.

Methods of evaluation for these problems are reviewed. Nonmalignant clinical conditions include asbestos warts, asbestos bodies, parenchymal fibrosis (asbestosis), pleural fibrosis and calcification, and benign asbestotic pleural effusion. Asbestosis, though a benign process, is a significant cause of death. Malignant conditions associated with asbestos exposure include lung cancer, accounting for about 20% of all deaths among insulation workers and significantly related to cigarette smoking. The lung cancers tend to occur more frequently in the lower lobes and are more peripheral. Pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma and some excesses in gastrointestinal cancers are found with asbestos exposure, although these are not related to cigarette smoking. Increased rates of malignancy first become significant after 20 years from onset of exposure and are also related to duration of exposure.

Effects of steroid hormones and colchicine on the response of pig lymphocytes to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) were assessed by measurement of [6-3H]thymidine incorporation. At steroid concentrations of 1 microM and below, only glucocorticoids and progesterone inhibited PHA-stimulated [6-3H]thymidine incorporation but at 100 microM inhibition was also produced by oestrogens, androgens and physiologically inactive steroids. Measurement of [6-3H]thymidine incorporation 18-24 hr, 6-12 hr or 0-6 hr after the delayed addition of the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, to PHA-stimulated lymphocytes revealed a succession of alternating phases of sensitivity and insensitivity to the effects of the steroid which suggested that it was acting, perhaps indirectly, in a cell cycle stage-specific manner to arrest the progression of activated lymphocytes from G1 to S. Similar effects were observed with colchicine, but 100 microM 11-epicortisol inhibited [6-3H]thymidine incorporation in a non-cycle-specific manner. Glucocorticoid receptor levels in pig lymphocytes were increased 2-5-fold within 24 hr of PHA stimulation.",Immunology

Very low concentrations of Clr, Cls, factor B and beta 2-microglobulin were detected. Trace amounts of four other components totalling less than 4% of the total protein, were seen and their molecular weights established. Reasons were advanced for thinking that fibrinogen, human serum albumin and alpha 2-macroglobulin were only secondarily associated with the complexes. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that IgG is the main, if not the only antigen, responsible for provoking and maintaining the pathological changes in rheumatoid arthritis.",Immunology
7389063,"Reduced myocardial response to calcium during endotoxin shock in the cat. The hemodynamic effects of short intravenous infusions of calcium chloride were examined in anaesthetized cats before and during shock induced with E coli endotoxin (2 mg/kg). In normal cats calcium (5 mg kg-1 min-1 or 10 mg kg-1 min-1 infused for 5 minutes) increased left ventricular (LV) dP/dtmax, LVdP/dt at fixed isovolumic pressures, systemic arterial blood pressure and, usually, cardiac output. These hemodynamic changes lasted approximately 20 minutes. During endotoxin shock the calcium response (cardiac output, LVdP/dt, blood pressure) was greatly reduced. This diminished responsiveness was evident as early as 0.5--1 hour after endotoxin and lasted throughout the 4-hour shock period. The duration of the hemodynamic response was also decreased during shock. Reduced myocardial sensitivity to a number of cardiac stimulants, including beta-adrenoceptor stimulants and agents augmenting cellular cAMP/levels, occurs in this and other shock models. The present results suggest that this altered sensitivity is attributable to changes in the actual contraction processes rather than beta-adrenoceptor desensitization or a defect in the cAMP system. Since this altered calcium response does not occur in vitro the results might suggest the presence, in shock, of a circulating agent acting at the level of cellular calcium exchange.",Immunology

With regard to the toxic effects of Ricinus lectin, neuraminidase-treated hepatoma cells have been found to be the most sensitive, and untreated hepatoma cells the least. Cells treated with neuraminidase and galactose oxidase exhibited an intermediate sensitivity. At 37 degrees C, the number of Ricinus lectin molecules bound to untreated, neuraminidase-treated and neuraminidase and galactose oxidase-treated cells required to being about 30% toxicity within 2 h was 15 . 10(5), 7.5 . 10(5) and 11.5 . 10(5) molecules/cell, respectively. This difference was rather small and suggests that the additional binding sites exposed following enzyme treatment were as efficient in mediating lectin toxicity as those present before enzyme treatment. Positive cooperativity was observed during Ricinus lectin binding to enzyme-treated cells at 37 degrees C and the apparent association constant increased with the increase of binding site occupancy. The binding sites on enzyme-treated cells appeared to be homogeneous since under different physical conditions (4 degrees C) the shape of the Scatchard plot could be altered in such a way as to produce a single line of slope. In contrast to enzyme-treated cells, untreated cells did not exhibit a positive cooperative process either at 37 degrees C or at 4 degrees C. We found that the toxicity of Ricinus lectin paralleled the irreversible specific binding of lectin, suggesting that only this was able to mediate the toxic effect. Our results are discussed in terms of the possible entry into the cells of Ricinus lectin and this occurs more rapidly in enzyme-treated than in untreated cells. This difference agrees with the sequence of events proposed: (i) Binding of Ricinus lectin; (ii) Clustering of lectin binding sites; and (iii) Endocytosis.",Immunology

Oxidation of linoleic acid in aqueous buffers favoured the formation of the 13 positional isomers of hydroperoxylinoleic acid. The reaction which was catalysed by haemoproteins and Fe(II) and Cu(II) ions showed positional selectivity that was similar to lipoxygenase-catalysed reactions but yielded equal proportions of both enantiomers of the hydroperoxides. There was little selectivity when methyl linoleate was used as the substrate or when linoleic acid was oxidised in organic solvents. The results indicated that positional selectivity was, at least in part, due to the conformation of the fatty acid molecule in aqueous media. Implication of the selectivity in a non-enzymic reaction is discussed especially in relation to its effect on the determination of lipoxygenase specificities.",Immunology

When the mother or father is affected and there is no consanguinity, the risk if 20%, but when the parents are first cousins, it is 32.5%. When both parents are affected it is 100%. When the parents are normal but one child is affected, the risk for the other children is 25%. When the mother or father is affected and there is already one child affected, the risk for the other children is 50%. When a grandparent is affected, the risk for the grandchildren is 10%. When an aunt or an uncle is affected, the risk for the nephews and nieces is 7%. With regard to genetic counseling, the parents must understand that no physician can guarantee that a child will be normal. They must also understand that the mendelian risks are the same for each pregnancy. Finally, they must know that for each child there is a 2 to 4% risk of a major congenital anomaly. From the human and psychological point of view, the physician must convince the parents that they are not responsible and that both the husband and the wife may carry pathologic genes, as every individual carries 2 to 10 pathologically recessive genes.

The wall material that was released contained only 47% amino acids and was enriched in lipid, glucose, and phosphate. These results support data from electron micrographs, showing the localized release of cell wall material by the disulfide bond-breaking reagent at alkaline pH. In amino acid composition the untreated walls did not differ greatly from the material released by dithiothreitol, but differed considerably from the walls of another strain of M. hungatii.

The authors propound five personal clinical cases of intra-thyroid metastases from epithelial carcinomas. Looking through the world literature, they found 134 other such cases. Analyzing these cases, there is a marked preponderance of renal cancers. The other most frequency primary cancers are of the breast, tract, lungs and skin epitheliomas. Undeclared metastases discovered at autopsy seem to be much more frequency (approximately 7.7% of those who die of their cancer have such metastases). This discrepancy between the rarity of clinical metastases and the frequency of microscopic metastases is explained by their very great latency and their very slow progress. This justifies the attempt at a curative treatment every time this is possible: surgery plus cobalt therapy. This can produce a fairly long survival rate: one year and four months on average when the metastasis is discovered before the primary cancer; two years and then months when the metastasis is discovered after.",Immunology

A psychophysical analysis was made of experiential factors that influence the affective but not the sensory-discriminative dimension of pain. Seven subjects made cross-modality matching responses to several dimensions of their experience. Before each stimulus, they matched line lengths to their experienced desire to avoid pain (significance) and to their perceived likelihood of avoiding it (expectation). After each stimulus, they matched line lengths to perceived sensation intensity (in some sessions) or to felt magnitudes of positive or negative feeling (in other sessions). Non-noxious (35, 42 degrees C) and noxious (45--51 degrees C) skin temperature stimuli were randomly interspersed during each experimental session. Changes in expectation were induced by preceding one-half of the noxious stimuli with a warning signal. The average responses of these subjects indicated that 45--51 degrees C noxious temperatures were felt as less unpleasant when preceded by a warning signal. In contrast, sensation magnitudes evoked by these same skin temperatures were unaffected by the warning signal. Thus, only the magnitudes of unpleasant responses are lowered by decreasing ones' expectation of avoiding pain. Analysis of individual responses revealed two distinct patterns of response changes following presentation of the warning signal. Four subjects retained the same general goal of avoiding pain and reduced their expectation of avoiding it. Their affective responses were less unpleasant during the warning signal. The remaining three subjects primarily altered their goals and not their expectations on signaled trials. Their affective responses were not modified by the signal. Subjects were instructed to arrive at their affective responses in two ways. In one session, they compared the outcome of each stmulation with what they wanted to happen (affect-result responses). In the other session, they simply focused on the pleasantness or unpleasantness of each sensation as it was experienced (affect-process responses). All subjects' affect-result responses were more positive (or less unpleasant) than affect-process responses. All of these results underscore the critical influence of expectations and the manner in which one evaluates sensations on affective responses to noxious stimulation.",Immunology

This study investigates the mechanism of the selective storage of the dopamine agonist 2-amino-5,6-dihydroxytetrahydronaphthalene (5,6-ADTN, used as the esterified prodrug) in densely innervated dopaminergic brain structures. The accumulation of 5,6-ADTN in dopamine-rich areas appeared to be non-saturable at the doses studied. In rats with a unilateral 6-OHDA lesion there was a corresponding unilateral decrease in 5,6-ADTN concentrations which suggests that the agonist interacts with dopamine uptake or storage mechanisms. Apart from an initial decreased penetration in the brain, reserpine-induced depletion of dopamine stores did not influence the accumulation of 5,6-ADTN in dopamine-rich areas, which suggests that 5,6-ADTN is taken up in the so-called 'non-reserpine sensitive DA-pool'. Unexpectedly, reserpine pretreatment caused a long-lasting (at least 170 h) decrease of 5,6-ADTN distribution in non-dopaminergic structures. 5,6-ADTN (used as the prodrug) could have a role to play in the elucidation of the significance of the various dopamine pools.",Immunology

Inactivation of rat heart complex was correlated with phosphorylation of site 1. Relative initial rates of phosphorylation were site 1 greater than site 2 greater than site 3. 2. Methods are described for measurement of incorporation of 32Pi into the complex in rat heart mitochondria oxidizing 2-oxoglutarate + L-malate (total, sites 1, 2 and 3). Inactivation of the complex was related linearly to phosphorylation of site 1 in mitochondria of normal or diabetic rats. The relative initial rates of phosphorylation were site 1 greater than site 2 greater than site 3. Rates of site-2 and site-3 phosphorylation may have been closer to that of site 1 in mitochondria of diabetic rats than in mitochondria of normal rats. 3. The concentration of inactive (phosphorylated) complex was varied in mitochondria from normal rats by inhibiting the kinase reaction with pyruvate at concentrations ranging from 0.15 to 0.4 mM. The results showed that the concentration of inactive complex is related linearly to incorporation of 32Pi into site 1. Inhibition of 32Pi incorporations with pyruvate at all concentrations over this range was site 3 greater than site 2 greater than site 1. 4. With mitochondria from diabetic rats, pyruvate (0.15-0.4 mM) inhibited incorporation of 32Pi into site 3, but it had no effect on the concentration of inactive complex or on incorporations of 32Pi into site 1 or site 2.

The time course for the partial deglycosylation of blood-group-specific glycoproteins from human ovarian-cyst fluids with 0.25 M-H2SO4/acetic acid and 6 M-HCl in methanol was studied. Either reagent readily removed about 80% of the carbohydrate from the glycoproteins to leave non-diffusible glycopeptides that contain N-acetylgalactosamine as the predominant sugar. Some changes in amino acid distribution were observed during the deglycosylation, which were attributed to an accelerated break-up of the nonglycosylated regions of the parent glycoprotein. The N-acetylgalactosaminyl-peptides isolated were judged to be polydisperse by gel filtration, and ion-exchange chromatography divided the glycopeptide population into several fractions with differing amino acid compositions. A Lumbricus terrestris hexosaminidase preparation was successful in removing almost all the remaining sugar from the glycopeptides, but caused further rupture of the peptide. When a per O-acetylated glycoprotein was treated with the H2SO4/acetic acid reagent the glycopeptide contained, in addition to N-acetylgalactosamine, about 50% of the sialic acid present in the parent glycoprotein, indicating that most of this sugar is located near the peptide end of the carbohydrate chains.",Immunology

In a prospective study, all injured knees that had traumatic hemarthrosis and absent or negligible instability on clinical examination underwent arthroscopy and examination under anesthesia. Eighty-five knees (eighty-three patients) were examined over a 125-week period. Some degree of disruption of the anterior cruciate ligament was found in sixty-one (72 per cent) of the knees (a partial tear in 28 per cent and a complete tear in 44 per cent), frequently associated with an injury of varying severity to other joint structures. These included minor ligament sprains without laxity in 41 per cent, a major associated ligament injury in 21 per cent, meniscal tears in 62 per cent (partial in 30 per cent and complete in 70 per cent), and a femoral chondral fracture or surface defect in 20 per cent. A popping sensation at injury occurred in 33 per cent of knees with a normal anterior cruciate ligament and in 36 per cent of those with a disruption. One-third of the knees had no to slight pain at the time of injury. The anterior drawer test without anesthesia was positive in only 24 per cent of the knees with a torn anterior cruciate ligament. We concluded that: (1) a traumatic hemarthrosis indicates a significant knee injury; (2) examination under anesthesia plus arthroscopy allows a more accurate diagnosis of injury to joint structures; and (3) such data are required for a rational treatment program to be outlined.",Immunology

An extensive evaluation of performance characteristics and accuracy of clinical results for two automated multiparameter whole-blood cell counters (the Coulter Counter Model S-Plus and the Ortho ELT-8) and two single-parameter semiautomated platelet counters (the J. T. Baker MK-4/HC and the Clay-Adams Ultra-Flo 100) is described. Results of comparative assays performed on more than 1,200 clinical specimens are analyzed. These results are compared with manual determinations where appropriate. Particular attention is accorded to the accuracy of platelet counts, especially at abnormal levels below 70 X 10(3)/cu mm, where falsely elevated platelet counts may lead to serious clinical consequences. Both multiparameter instruments yielded accurate results,  with the exception of low values reported by the ELT-8 for mean corpuscular volumes above 100 cu micrometer. Results for platelet counts were accurate for most specimens on all four instruments; the ELT-8 was the most reliable (P < 0.01), especially for the critically low counts. Although no instrument is infallible in determining platelet counts at all levels, the authors conclude that addition of platelet-counting capability represents a significant advancement over existing instrumentation.",Immunology

The effect of food intake versus brief fasting on gastrointestinal absorption of lead was measured in five healthy men who were living in a metabolic unit and eating constant lead diets. Lead absorpiton was assessed by the difference between dietary intake and output of 1) lead tracers composed of nonradioactive isotopes which were ingested as a single dose either with food or during a 16-hr fast, 2) lead tracers ingested with meals for relatively long periods (2 to 124 days), and 3) total led in ingested foods. Absorption estimated by 1) was confirmed by increments in tracer concentrations in blood. Lead tracers were given as nitrate, cysteine complex, or sulfide. Absorption was 10.3 +/- 2.2% (SD) for food lead; 8.2 +/- 2.8% for tracers ingested with food; and 35 +/- 13% (P < 0.01) percent for tracers ingested without food.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a zinc-deficient diet to study its effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. As zinc-deficient animals fail to gain weight, they were compared to pair-fed growth restricted animals as well as ad libitum fed controls. The growth velocity curves were superimposable for the zinc-deficient animals and the pair-fed controls; both were markedly reduced compared to the ad libitum controls. Both the zinc-deficient and the pair-fed controls had lower triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine levels compared to the ad libitum controls. In addition T3 values were lower in the zinc-deficient animals compared to the pair-fed controls (P < 0.05). Hypothalamic thyrotrophin-releasing hormone content was decreased in the zinc-deficient rats (162 +/- 32 pg/ml) compared to the ad libitum controls (305 +/- 102; P < 0.01). The 125I thyroidal uptakes were not significantly different between the zinc-deficient and the pair-fed controls. Zinc deficiency lowers T3 more than comparable caloric restriction; this suggests that zinc deficiency may impair extrathyroidal production of T3.",Immunology
7405877,"Skeletal muscle fiber splitting with weight-lifting exercise in rats. Adult male albino rats were assigned randomly to control (CON) and weight-lifting (WL) groups. The WL rats were subjected to a progressive weight-lifting program against high resistance for 8 weeks. During the last 2 weeks, each WL rat lifted a load equal to 130% of its body weight. The mean weight of the adductor longus muscle was significantly increased in the WL group ( p <  0.05). This increased muscle weight was shown to be due to an increase in the number of fibers per unit cross-sectional area ( p < 0.05), and the mean sizes of both fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic and slow-twitch oxidative fibers were significantly smaller in the WL rats than in the CON rats (p < 0.05). Light and electron microscopic examination showed that five out of eight WL rats exhibited longitudinally split muscle fibers,  while only one CON rat had a few centrally placed nuclei. The splitting process appeared as either a ""pinching-off"" of a small segment from the parent fiber or an invagination of the sarcolemma deep into the muscle fiber in a plane parallel to the sarcomeres. There were preliminary indications that this work-induced fiber-splitting process may be a physiological adaptation of muscle to the stress of exercise.",Immunology

The ratio of cases of the corpus uteri to those of the cervix was 6.5/100. The average age of the former group was 58 years and 30% of them were nulligravida. The rates of accompanying hyprtension and obesity were 21% and 20%, respectively. With regard to clinical stages, 75% were Stage I, 13% were Stage II, 10% were Stage III and 1% were Stage IV. The histological grade was G1 in 61%, G2 in 26%, and G3 in 13%. In Stage I, 80% of the cases had myometrial invasion into less than 1/3 of the uterine wall, but in Stage II invasion was limited to 1/3 in less than 25%. Metastasis to pelvic lymph nodes was found in 3 of 34 cases (9%): 1 of 24 cases of Stage I (4%) and 2 of 9 (cases of Stage II (22%). All three of these cases had myometrial invasion reaching deeper than 1/3 of the uterine wall. Those with deep myometrial invasion showed a diffuse invasive pattern, as did those of G2 or G3 lesions. Cases of G1 lesions showed a relatively shallow myometrial invasion, whereas there was a tendency for cases of G2 or G3 lesions to have deep myometrial invasion.

Three types of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase were identified in rabbit whole kidney homogenate when the centrifuged homogenate was sequentially fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-cellulose and Matrex Gel Blue A chromatographies, and Sephadex gel filtration. The first type is not adsorbed to DEAE-cellulose (peak 1). It catalyzes oxidoreduction of prostaglandins at both the C-15 and C-9 positions, is more active with NADP than NAD, is inhibited by indomethacin and ethacrynic acid, and migrates as three bands on disc gel electrophoresis. The second type is adsorbed to DEAE-cellulose (peak 2). It also migrates as multiple electrophoretic bands, has similar catalytic actions and co-factor requirements as the peak 1 enzyme and is inhibited by indomethacin and ethacrynic acid. A third type of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase is also adsorbed to DEAE-cellulose but is partially separable from the other peak 2 enzymes on Matrex Gel Blue A and differs from those enzymes in preferentially oxidizing PGI2.

Birds from houses with window coverings deposited the same amount of pigment in the skin as did birds from the open house as indicated by blood xanthophyll level and excitation purity. Skin color scores, however, as well as dominant wavelengths and luminosities of shanks from these birds, indicated that pigmentation of birds grown in the house with 42% light transmission window coverings was significantly inferior to that observed for birds grown in either the open house or the house with 89% light transmission window covering.

Preoperatively 20 patients were in sinus rhythm, but not in patients with atrial fibrillation, there was a highly significant correlation between digoxin concentration in serum and right atrial myocardium, in skeletal muscle and right atrial myocardium, and in serum and skeletal muscle. The means and variances of the ratios right atrial myocardium/serum and right atrial myocardium skeletal muscle were significantly higher in patients with atrial fibrillation than in those with sinus rhythm. This, plus the lack of difference in ratios skeletal muscle serum between these groups of patients, indicate increased right atrial digoxin binding in atrial fibrillation in man. This conclusion is further supported by the finding of similar or higher digoxin concentration in right atrial myocardium than in left ventricular myocardium in atrial fibrillation (6 patients), and a lower digoxin concentration in right atrial myocardium than in left ventricular myocardium in sinus rhythm (3 patients).",Immunology

We have examined anticipatory postural responses in calf muscles (triceps surae) in response to a small pull to the arm in standing subjects. This stimulus normally evokes a brisk automatic compensatory contraction of the calf muscles. This is not due to calf muscle stretch, for leg movement occurs after the response has appeared. It appears to be driven centrally by input produced by the pull to the arm. Such anticipatory postural responses were present in every one of the 50 normal subjects studied, but were absent or greatly reduced in many patients with Parkinson's disease when compared to age-matched normal subjects, particularly in those exhibiting postural instability. However, a normal anticipatory postural response was elicited in four patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and in a single patient with an akinetic rigid syndrome due to cerebrovascular disease. Cerebellar truncal ataxia only depressed the response in severe cases. We conclude that although these responses may not be necessary to maintain balance, they may be employed in fine adjustment of posture.",Immunology

It was stated that by the 14th day of age motoneurons acquire features of mature neurons. Several types of synapses were found: axo-dendritic, axo-somatic, axo-axonal. Axo-dentritic synapses prevail in neuropil of the spinal cord motor nuclei at the age studied. Synapses in 10--13-day-old rats sometimes demonstrate an immature ultrastructure. A peculiar feature of the neuropil is the presence of dendritic bundles consisting of dendrites various in their calibers or of dendrites and preterminal parts of axons.

Exercise was associated with a reduction in the dose of antihypertensive medications in four patients and a decrease in phosphate binder therapy in three patients. There was also a rise in hematocrit levels (% delta = 34 +/- 20%, P less than 0.03) and the hemoglobin concentration (% delta = 37 +/- 23%, P less than 0.05) of five males. Plasma glucose levels fell (-5 +/- 2%, P less than 0.05, n = 5) and the glucose disappearance rate improved (20 +/- 7%, P less than 0.02), while hyperinsulinism decreased (-36 +/- 20%, P less than 0.02, n = 5) during training. There was no change in body weight or diet. Exercise lowered plasma triglyceride levels (-41 +/- 28%, P less than 0.02, n = 6) and raised the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration (20 +/- 21%, P less than 0.05, n = 6).

Tissue samples for PCP, OCDD, and pentachloroanisole (PCA) were cleaned up via gel permeation chromatography and analyzed by gas chromatography employing electron capture detection. Kidney weights were significantly increased by the 100 ppm and 1000 ppm PCP diet. Weights of all other organs including the body weights were significantly lowered by the 1000 ppm PCP diet. Except for the control group, histopathologic examination of the liver revealed bile duct proliferation and some fatty changes in all of the 6-week-old birds. Examination of the brain, liver, gizzard, pancreas, intestine, proventriculus, spleen, kidney, lung, and heart revealed no histopathological lesions in the treated or control birds. Significant linear relationships were found between PCP accumulation in tissues and the concentration of dietary PCP. Accumulation of PCP was greatest in the kidney followed by liver, heart, leg, breast, gizzard, and fat. The high residue levels in the kidney and liver may reflect principal routes of elimination and metabolism. Following a 5 week withdrawal of PCP from the diet, PCP residues were still present in the adipose tissue of all treated birds. Residue levels in the kidney and liver were reduced at the first and third week of withdrawal, but a continuous decline was interrupted by a slight elevation in residue level at the fifth week of withdrawal from the chemical.",Immunology

Some hospital clinical pharmacology departments operate quality-control schemes to monitor the efficiency of their own and outside pharmacological laboratories in analysing specimens, to maintain or improve quality of performance and to compare the reliability of different methods. The Department of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, has been operating a quality-control scheme in which the results from some 18 or more laboratories in analysing the mixed tricyclic-antidepressant content of spiked sera were compared for reliability, six methods being used in all. The measures employed were the overall standard deviation and coefficient of variation, a small coefficient of variation indicating a good quality of performance. Sera contained either amitriptyline and nortriptyline, or imipramine and desipramine. The coefficients of variation were considerably smaller than those reported previously and were greater for external than internal laboratories, while laboratories where tricyclic antidepressants are assayed routinely had a low variation. The skill and experience of the analyst are therefore important. Although there is room for improvement in the scheme, it has already provided valuable objective measures of performance and emphasized the need for a self-critical approach.",Immunology

7391004,"Evidence of inactivation of pineal indoleamine N-acetyltransferase by protein thiol:disulfide exchange. Pineal indoleamine N-acetyltransferase activity in homogenates is rapidly reduced at pH 6.8 by treatment with cystamine or arginine vasotocin. Other disulfides including glutathione disulfide, penicillamine disulfide, and N,N'-diacetylcystamine are either ineffective or less effective. The diamine analogous to cystamine, diaminohexane, is also ineffective. Inactivation by cystamine is accelerated at higher pH and is temperature- and time-dependent. It was also found that cystamine treatment inactivated N-acetyltransferase in intact pineal cells. Treatment with dithiothreitol reactivated the cystamine- or arginine vasotocin-inactivated enzyme formed in broken cell preparations and the cystamine-inactivated enzyme formed in intact cells. These observations indicate that pineal N-acetyltransferase can be inactivated by protein thiol:disulfide exchange; further research is required to ascertain whether this mechanism is of physiological significance.",Immunology

Our corrected data suggest the presence of a segregation distortion in favor of the affected among the daughters of affected mothers (45:25; x12 = 5.71). This apparent anomalous segregation is not significant in the other comparisons made, although the p values corresponding to the x12 for two of them (78:56 and 109:83) are near 5%. Other 'similar' (although possibly different on the genetic aspect) A2 cases in the literature do not present any evidence of anomalous segregation.

A sedimentation velocity study has been carried out of the vinblastine-induced self-association of calf brain tubulin in PG (0.01 M NaPi and 10(-4) M GTP, pH 7.0) buffer as a function of vinblastine concentration and temperature. The dependence of the weight-average sedimentation coefficients (S20,W) on total protein concentration can be fitted best by an isodesmic, indefinite self-association mechanism. Apparent association constants, derived by computer fittings of the S20,W data, were analyzed in terms of the Wyman linkage equations. Fitting to a variety of reaction models suggested that the self-association is one ligand molecule mediated; i.e., the binding of one vinblastine molecule is coupled to the formation of each intertubulin bond. The intrinsic association equilibrium constant for dimerization of the vinblastine-liganded tubulin was found to be 1.8 x 10(5) M-1. The self-asociation is characterized by an apparent van't Hoff enthalpy change of +8.0 kcal/mol at 5 x 10(-5) M vinblastine and is driven by a positive entropy change. Apparent binding isotherms of vinblastine to tubulin were calculated based on the association mechanism and parameters derived from the linkage analysis and were found to be consistent with the vinblastine binding results previously reported in our laboratory under identical conditions [Lee, J. C., Harrison, D., & Timasheff, S. N. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 9276---9282].

The effect of altering the delivered load of glucose by either increasing the rate of perfusion or the initial glucose concentration on the absorptive flux of glucose was examined in rat proximal tubule using the in vivo microperfusion technique. The passive flux coefficient was determined to be 1.27 pmol . min-1 . mm-1 . mM-1 glucose concentration gradient. With initial glucose concentrations of either 11.1 or 22.2 mM, the glucose flux increased as the rate of perfusion was increased. At similar rates of perfusion, glucose flux was higher from 22.2 mM glucose solution than from the 11.1 mM solution. Estimation of the driving force for passive glucose efflux indicates that the increase in glucose efflux when flow rate is increased cannot be accounted for by passive changes in efflux out of the proximal tubule. When large transepithelial glucose gradients are imposed across the tubule, passive glucose flux plays a more significant role, but cannot totally account for higher rates of glucose efflux observed with the perfusion solution containing 22.2 mM glucose. These results are considered in light of the recent model of the flow dependency of nonelectrolyte absorption of Barfuss and Schafer [Am. J.

A spherical catheter-mounted balloon, acting as a prosthetic aortic valve for the correction of acute aortic regurgitation, was tested in 12 dogs. This ""valve"" was actively inflated and deflated by means of a common intra-aortic balloon pumping system (Datascope). A significant increase of end-diastolic pressure in the descending aorta, from 51.72 +/- 1.72 to 70.35 +/- 1.92 mm Hg (mean +/- standard error, p less than 0.001), was obtained, without a significant pressure gradient across the ""valve"".

7381768,"Second and third visual areas of the cat: interindividual variability in retinotopic arrangement and cortical location. 1. The cortical location and the retinotopic arrangement of the second (V2) and third (V3) visual areas in the cat have been investigated with single and multiple unit recordings in anaesthetized and immobilized animals.2. V2 and V3 are arranged side by side anterior and medial to V1 and occupy the lateral gyrus and the postlateral sulcus. In addition, V2 spreads to postlateral parts of the lateral sulcus and, occasionally, to the posterior suprasylvian gyrus. The contralateral lower hemifield is represented on the lateral gyrus, the area centralis and the horizontal meridian are found in most animals in the anterior part of the postlateral sulcus, and the representation of the upper hemifield occupies the posterior part of the postlateral sulcus.3. The detailed retinotopic arrangement of the visual field maps shows two characteristic features. First, the retinotopy at the V2/V3 border differs between lower and upper hemifield. In the lower hemifield the periphery of the fields is represented, whereas in the upper hemifield the border between the representations is formed by a sector running along the horizontal meridian about 5-10 degrees in the upper hemifield. Thus the lower field arrangement resembles that of rodents, and the upper field arrangement is similar to that of primates. Secondly, the periphery of a part of the visual field is not continuously represented, but forms patches or islands (Donaldson & Whitteridge, 1977). The islands are bounded by visual field representations closer to the vertical meridian. The way the visual field is represented at the border between V2 and V3 introduces discontinuities into the visual field maps: adjacent parts of the visual field are not represented adjacently in these two prestriate areas.4. Cortical location and detailed retinotopic arrangement vary considerably from animal to animal, so that a representative map of V2 and V3 cannot be constructed. For example, the representation of the periphery of the horizontal meridian may be located either in the anterior portion of the postlateral sulcus or some mm more posteriorly, where the sulcus turns laterally. The representation of the area centralis in V3 is found either at the transition zone between lateral and postlateral sulcus, on the posterior suprasylvian gyrus, or in the posterior part of the postlateral sulcus.5. The entire hemifield is represented in V2 at least in some animals. In V3 the uppermost part of the vertical meridian seems not to be represented. In other animals only a restricted part of the contralateral visual field is represented in V2 or in V3. In these cases the receptive fields cover not more than 50 degrees out in the lower hemifield or on the horizontal meridian. In a few cases the periphery of the horizontal meridian and the upper hemifield are not at all represented in V3, or only in an incomplete manner.6. The magnification factors (Daniel & Whitteridge, 1961) become progressively smaller from V1 to V2 to V3. Hence cortical volume occupied decreases from V1 to V3. In V1 and in V2 the magnification is highest along the lower vertical meridian. In V2 the magnification along the horizontal meridian is the smallest, whereas in V1 the magnification decreases progressively from the lower vertical, to the horizontal and to the upper vertical meridian. The relationship between retinal ganglion cell densities and cortical magnification factors is discussed.",Immunology

In vitro exposure of homogeneous monolayer cultures of thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages to glucocorticoid hormones for up to 96 hr produced a progressive, dose-related inhibition of cell growth and protein synthesis. The reductions in cell protein, incorporation of radiolabeled leucine, and intracellular water space were specific to steroids with glucocorticoid action, with half-maximal inhibition occurring at about 10(-9) M for dexamethasone. Similar dose-related, glucocorticoid-specific decreases in net glucose uptake, lactate production, and 14CO2 production were observed that were only partially explained by the decrease in cell mass. A decrease in the monosaccharide transport system Vmax was also noted but could be completely accounted for by the reduction in cell surface area and the resulting proportional loss in transport sites. No effect on transport system affinity could be demonstrated. The suggestion was made that such long-term culture of macrophages in the presence of glucocorticoids reverses the biochemical and functional changes that comprise the ""activated"" state of mononuclear phagocytes.",Immunology

Metaproterenol 0.65 mg produced just as much increase of 1-sec forced expiratory volume (FEV1) as did the much larger dose (1.95 mg), but each subsequent inhalation of the drug produced further, significant increase of FEV1 suggesting better penetration of the bronchidilator aerosol after some bronchodilation had been achieved. After completion of treatment, the FEV1 was significantly higher when the drug was given sequentially rather than all at once. These data have important implications with respect to the utilization of bronchodilator aerosols in the treatment of asthma and indicate the unsuitability of sequential inhalation for study of dose response of these agents.",Immunology

Rat testis contains a unique H1 histone variant (H1t) not detected in a variety of other rat organs. H1t is extracted from chromatin by salt as expected for an H1 component (released by 0.6 M NaCl but not by 0.3 M); however, in contrast to other mammalian H1 species, H1t is not extracted in significant amounts by 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. H1t is undetectable in testes from 3-or 15-day-old rats, but is evident in extracts from 21-day-old animals. Its initial appearance in the developing testis thus correlates with the progression of germinal cells to the meiotic stage of differentiation. H1t was isolated in homogeneous form by extraction of whole tissue with 0.75 M perchloric acid, fractional precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, and two cycles of chromatography over a cation exchange resin (Bio Rex 70). The amino acid composition of H1t differs significantly from that of somatic type H1 variants (for example, higher arginine and methionine content). Its identification as an H1 species is supported by analysis of the two fragments resulting from treatment of the protein with N-bromosuccinimide. H1t, as well as the six recognized somatic type H1 components of rat testis may be resolved by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis run in the absence of denaturants at pH 4.5 in the first dimension and in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate in the second dimension.",Immunology

In an experiment on 25 women and men who were selected for short RT (reaction time) and who ranged from 22 to 85 years of age, some loss of preparation was found over an interval of about 4 seconds during which there was constant momentary probability of signal occurrence. The central finding was that the amount of loss remained invariant with age. Numerous controls were used to ascertain that this stability was not an artifact. Support was given to the contention of Loveless and Sanford [14] that the markedly longer RTs found for older than for younger subjects when long, constant PIs (preparatory intervals) are employed is not attributable to difference in ability to maintain preparation. However, the reason for the foregoing effect remains in question. Loveless and Sanford [14] suggest that older subjects may not be able to control preparation in some more general sense and suggest that they do not use available timing information. However, similar findings on schizophrenics have been explained in terms of inhibitory effects with increased redundancy [1].

Coronary vasospasm was demonstrated in 23 patients with ST-segment elevation during chest pain (group I), in 7 with ST-segment depression (group II), and in 4 with both ST-segment depression and elevation (group III). Complete spastic occlusion of the proximal or of the midportion of the left anterior descending artery was always associated with ST-segment elevation in anterior leads. In contrast, transient ST-segment depression in anterior leads was associated with diffuse narrowing of the left anterior descending artery with slow progression of the contrast medium, or complete occlusion of a small branch or of the distal segment of the left anterior descending artery. ST-segment elevation in inferior leads was associated with complete spastic occlusion or with significant spastic narrowing of the right coronary artery or of the circumflex artery.

Both the normal subjects and coronary artery disease patients had normal resting ejection fractions (greater than 0.50). In the normal subjects the mean ejection fraction increased significantly (p less than 0.005) from rest (0.61 +/- 0.03) to peak supine bicycle exercise (0.71 +/- 0.04), and the mean ejection fraction also remained significantly higher (p less than 0.005) at rest than during 10 min post-treadmill exercise. However, the coronary artery disease patients did not significantly change the mean ejection fractions from rest (0.59 +/- 0.06) to peak supine bicycle exercise (0.55 +/- 0.08), and the average ejection fraction during each one of the post-treadmill recovery periods was not significantly different from rest. At the third recovery period all the normals but no coronary artery disease patients had higher ejection fraction than the resting ejection fraction. We thus conclude that the magnitude of change in ejection fraction from rest to 8-10 min post-treadmill exercise in patients with normal resting ejection fraction may be helpful in identifying those with coronary disease.",Immunology

The results obtained may be summarized as follows. (1) A positive correlation was found between an increase in firing rate of a single neuron in the thalamic relay nucleus and somatosensory area and an increase in local cerebral blood flow following stimulation of the sciatic nerve. A distinct spatial and quantitative correlation was thus observed between neural activity and cerebral blood flow. (2) In 6-OHDA-pretreated cats, an increase in neuronal firing rate was observed following stimulation of the sciatic nerve, as it was in non-pretreated cats, but the concurrent response of local cerebral blood flow was seriously impaired. All these findings indicate that the increase in local cerebral blood flow occurring in association with increased neural activity does not result solely from increased local metabolism and a consequent increase in CO2 production, but requires for its occurrence that certain basic conditions be satisfied and maintained by the vasoadrenergic innervation.",Immunology

Radiation dose-response curves for anoxic blood containing 8 mM metronidazole or misonidazole were compared with previously obtained curves for dicentric and total aberration induction in untreated anoxic blood. Values calculated from these curves for the enhancement ratios at dose above about 1.0 Gy were 1.4 and 2.2 for metronidazole and misonidazole respectively. These values are comparable with enhancement ratios observed in other biological systems.",Immunology

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) produced a significant inhibition of release only at 10(-3) M. 3 Theophylline 10(-4) or 10(-3) M reduced the inhibitory effect of adenosine, but did not change basal release of GABA. 4 Dipyridamole 10(-5) M itself reduced evoked GABA release, but did not prevent the inhibitory effect of adenosine, implying that adenosine was acting at an extracellularly directed receptor. 5 Calcium removal or antagonism by verapamil reduced the evoked release of GABA, but adenosine did not produce any further reduction of the calcium-independent release. This may indicate that the inhibitory effect of adenosine on GABA release results from interference with calcium influx or availability within the terminals.",Immunology

Single doses of drugs were injected into the aortic cannula. 2 Small doses of acetylcholine, carbachol or bethanechol decreased perfusion pressure (PP) without markedly affecting left ventricular pressure (LVP) and heart rate (HR); larger doses of these drugs increased PP (vasoconstriction), and decreased LVP and HR in a dose-dependent manner. 3 Acetylcholine, carbachol and bethanechol had almost no effects when perfused through the aorta in such a way as to exclude the coronary vessels. 4 Coronary vasoconstriction in response to acetylcholine, carbachol and bethanechol was not significantly affected by reserpine pretreatment, phentolamine or hexamethonium, but was antagonized by small doses of atropine. 5 From these results it is concluded that in the coronary vasculature of the rat, the receptors involved in the vasoconstrictor actions of acetylcholine carbachol and bethanechol are muscarinic.",Immunology

They also agglutinate rabbit and mouse erythrocytes, a marine yeast and a bacterium, and have weak activity against mouse sarcoma 180 cells, human B, guinea pig, and horse erythrocytes. The hemagglutinating activity was not affected by the treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol, trypsin, or pronase, but was inhibited by a high concentration of N-acetylneuraminic acid. The major active component was purified and found to be a protein having a molecular weight of 68 000 which dissociates into subunits of equal size (16 000).

7378439,"Lipolytic activity in adipocyte cell fractions. Adipocytes release only negligible amounts of free fatty acids unless stimulated, but reveal considerable lipolytic activity when homogenized. Epinephrine treatment of the cells caused only a 20-40% increase in the activity of infranatants of homogenates while raising the activity associated with the fat layer up to 10-fold. Full activity (i.e. that of intact-activated cells) could be revealed by epinephrine treatment of the homogenate as well as by sonication of the fat layer in buffer. The combination of both treatments did not yield higher activities. The fat cake contains the bulk of the potential activities which are only realized when dispersed in the aqueous phase by sonication, or upon hormone activation of the whole homogenate. Increase in activity could also be obtained by removal of most of the lipid from the fat layer by extraction with petroleum ether. Re-introduction of extracted lipid inhibited lipolysis. The active enzyme could be separated by flotation at 1.12 specific gravity. The data suggest that the lack of activity in the intact non-stimulated cell may be due to the lack of availability of the aqueous phase to the enzyme.",Immunology

The decay of fluorescence yield following each of a series of saturating laser flashes has been used to monitor the kinetics of reoxidation of the primary acceptor of Photosystem II under conditions of varied redox potential. 1. In dark-adapted chloroplasts, a damped binary oscillation as a function of flash number was observed in the kinetics of the decay of the fluorescence yield. The decay was faster on odd than on even-numbered flashes. 2. In the presence of low concentrations of 1,4-benzoquinone, the oscillation was more marked, and over the range approx 200--350 mV, independent of redox potential. The decay following flash 1 under these conditions had a half-time of approx. 200--400 microseconds. The decay following flash 2 was decelerated; the initial rate was up to 10-fold slower than after flash 1. 3. We suggest that the kinetics following a single flash reflect the rate of the reaction Q-B leads to QB-, and following the second flash, Q-B- leads to QB2-. Benzoquinone at low concentrations oxidises a residual fraction of B- which is usually reduced in the dark before the flash sequence. 4. A faster component in the decay (t u/2 approximately 140 microseconds) following the first flash titrated in over the range Eh greater than 350 mV. The binary oscillation was still apparent but delayed by one flash. 5. We discuss the relative redox potentials of the couples B/B- and B-/B2-, and the role of the component which titrates in at Eh greater than 350 mV.",Immunology
7378389,"Synthesis and characterization of phosphocitric acid, a potent inhibitor of hydroxylapatite crystal growth. Human urine and extracts of rat liver mitochondria contain apparently identical agents capable of inhibiting the precipitation or crystallization of calcium phosphate. Its general properties, as well as 1H NMR and mass spectra, have suggested that the agent is phosphocitric acid. This paper reports the synthesis of phosphocitric acid via the phosphorylation of triethyl citrate with o-phenylene phosphochloridate, hydrogenolysis of the product to yield triethyl phosphocitrate, hydrolytic removal of the blocking ethyl groups  and also chromatographic purification. An enzymatic assay of phosphocitrate is described. Synthetic phosphocitrate was found to be an exceedingly potent inhibitor of the growth of hydroxylapatite seed crystals in a medium supersaturated with respect to Ca2+ and phosphate. Comparative assays showed phosphocitrate to be much more potent than the most active precipitation-crystallization inhibitors previously reported, which include pyrophosphate and ATP. 14C-Labeled phosphocitrate was bound very tightly to hydroxylapatite crystals. Such binding appeared to be essential for its inhibitory activity on crystal growth. Citrate added before  but not after, phosphocitrate greatly enhanced the inhibitory potency of the latter. This enhancement effect was not given by other tricarboxylic acids. The monoethyl ester of phosphocitrate had no inhibitory effect on hydroxylapatite crystal growth.",Immunology

Raman spectra of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholines specifically deuterated in the 2 chain at one of positions 3, 4, 6, 10, 12, and 14 have been obtained as a function of temperature. The frequencies of the CD2 vibrational stretching modes depend on the position of the labeled CD2 group, being maximum at position 3 of the acyl chain and then decreasing until they become constant beyond position 6. This frequency dependence is interpreted in terms of the inductive effect of the charge distribution of the acyl chain carboxyl group. In both gel and liquid-crystal phases, the Raman line widths depend on the position of the CD2 group, being minimum at position 6 and increasing toward both ends of the hydrocarbon chain. The width of the CD stretching bands abruptly increases at the phase transition temperature. The magnitude of the increase depends upon the position of the label, increasing almost linearly up to position 10 and then decreasing for positions 12 and 14. The spectra for the CD2 group at position at position 3 and the terminal CD3 group are almost the same in both phases. These results are interpreted in terms of the effects of hydrocarbon chain organization on the vibrational modes.",Immunology

Thirty-three peptides have been synthesized which have the ability to inhibit aggregation of sickle hemoglobin which occurs upon deoxygenation. Evidence is presented which indicates that the hydrophobicity of the side chains is the predominant factor. A linear correlation exists between the capacity of peptides to inhibit gelation and the additivity of the side-chain hydrophobic contributions. Small di- and tri-peptides are more responsive to changes in their nonpolar content than are larger oligopeptides whose antigelling activity is a slowly varying function of hydrophobicity. With few exceptions, charged substituent groups on the side chain do not appear to contribute to the inhibitory process. Thus, if hydrogen bonding or ionic interactions are involved with these residues, they appear to play only a secondary role in the molecular interactions responsible for inhibiting or delaying the deoxy-HbS gelation.",Immunology

Wheat germ ribosomes combine with the AUG codon at positions 30-32 from the 5' terminus of in vitro radioiodinated satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) to form initiation complexes that protect specific regions of the RNA from attack by ribonucleases. Wheat gern 80S ribosomes convey partial protection to a region 20-52 nucleotides from the 5' terminus of STNV RNA and convey protection against high levels of ribonucleases to a region 20-44 nucleotides from the 5' terminus of STNV RNA.

We have examined the relationship of phosphate content in histone H1 of Physarum polycephalum to mitotic chromosome condensation and affinity for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). H1 undergoes a series of posttranslational phosphorylations which increase its apparent molecular weight on NaDodSO4-polyacrylamide gels. Our studies confirm the observation by Bradbury and co-workers [Bradbury, E. M., Inglis, R. J., Matthews, H. R., & Sarner, N (1973) Eur. J. Biochem. 33, 131-139; Bradbury, E. M., Inglis, R.

However, we show in pulse-chase experiments with both 32PO4H1 and [14C]lysine H1 that there is no significant dephosphorylation of the histone either during or shortly after mitosis, suggesting that nonspecific postmitotic dephosphorylation of H1 is not a prerequisite for chromosome decondensation. We also show that both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of H1 bind with somewhat greater affinity to single-stranded DNA-cellulose than to native DNA-cellulose and that phosphorylation weakens the affinity of H1 to both forms of DNA-cellulose.",Immunology

In twelve anaesthetised, ventilated dogs the effects of hypercapnia and pharmacologically induced arterial hypotension and hypertension on the interrelation between volume-pressure response (VPR) and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) pulse pressure were studied during continuous inflation of a supratentorial extradural balloon. Hypercapnia did not significantly affect the intracranial volume-pressure relationships, but did cause a significant increase in gradient of the relationship between CSF pulse pressure and intracranial pressure (ICP). Alteration of the arterial blood pressure showed opposite effects on VPR and CSF pulse pressure. A decrease in VPR and an increase in pulse pressure were observed during arterial hypotension; the reverse was found during arterial hypertension. The discrepancy between the effects on VPR and CSF pulse pressure of the variables under study was explained by changes in the transient increase in cerebral blood volume per cardiac cycle. On the basis of the results of this study it will be possible, during clinical ICP monitoring, to interpret changes in the CSF pulse pressure to ICP ratio in terms of changes in intracranial volume-pressure relationships.",Immunology

The simultaneous increase in slice-to-medium ratio of renal cortical slices demonstrate the increase in specific transport capacity of regenerating kidney tissue. Furthermore the increase in kidney mass is the reason for an elevated transport capacity. Stimulation of renal PAH excretion by repeated pretreatment with cyclopenthiazide shortened the phase of compensation and raised the extent of tubular transport capacity following partial loss of kidney tissue. The specific accumulation of PAH in renal cortical slices from nephrectomized, cyclopenthiazide pretreated rats is distinctly elevated 96 h after unilateral nephrectomy from 19.4 +/- 2.7 to 24.3 +/- 0.6 micrograms/g kidney weight. Obviously there are different mechanisms for the increased PAH transport caused by stimulation and by regeneration after unilateral nephrectomy, because additional effects can be stated in regenerating rats by additional stimulation of renal tubular transport.",Immunology
7056255,"Membranes of protein bodies. I. Isolation from cotyledons of germinating cucumber seeds. Protein bodies were prepared from cotyledons of germinating seeds of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) in different ways: the organelles either obtained from protoplasts by lysis or from cotyledons by mechanical disintegration were separated on sucrose-density gradients. In addition, a non-aqueous procedure was employed to isolate protein bodies. Marker proteins indicative of membranes of other organelles were carefully assayed. By this means contaminations in the purified protein-body fractions could be ruled out. Isolated protein bodies were separated into crystalloids, matrix, and membranes. The membranes were purified and characterized according to their equilibrium density (rho = 1.20 kg/l) on sucrose gradients by flotation or sedimentation. Protein-body membranes labelled in the phospholipid moiety were prepared and analyzed after application of [methyl-14C] choline or [32P] phosphate in vivo.",Immunology
7051334,"The Rockefeller Foundation, the China Foundation, and the development of modern science in China. Two powerful foundations, with interlocking directorates, were the most important media for transmitting American science to China and for making its development possible: In the 1920s and 1930s, the Rockefeller Foundation's China Medical Board and the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture recognized that transmission and development required much more than the transplantation of whole scientific institutions. This essay shows that, in their most mature form, the foundations' strategies were informed by a rational and coherent set of policies. Their premise was that the practice and development of advanced scientific medicine and bio-medical or natural scientific research all require an infrastructure of education, communication, physical plant, and equipment. This infrastructure did not exist before the foundations began to foster it in China. In this essay the foundations' China policies are outlined and detailed examples are given to show they built the science infrastructure amidst debate over the appropriateness of the dominant 'Johns Hopkins' institutional model and the norm of 'pure science'. In China, the 'Hopkins' model for medical training and practice featured a combination of clinical practice with sophisticated scientific laboratory research. This model and the 'pure science' norm were seriously challenged by the political and economic exigencies of the 1930s.",Immunology

Fasting plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations were determined in 25 men and 25 women (mean ages 42 and 39 yr respectively) whose exclusive mode of regular exercise was tennis play. When compared to a sedentary group matched for age, sex, and education, the tennis players exhibited similar plasma total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations and significantly lower triglyceride and VLDL-cholesterol concentrations. Plasma HDL-cholesterol was significantly higher in the tennis players (57.8 +/- 13.9 versus 46.2 +/- 12.0 mg/100 ml in the men and 73.9 +/- 12.3 versus 61.7 +/- 13.3 mg/100 ml in the women). When we simultaneously controlled for age, relative weight, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, and oral contraceptive use (in females), the significance of the difference in plasma HDL-cholesterol as well as triglyceride and VLDL-cholesterol concentrations was unaffected in the males but substantially reduced in the females. It is concluded that frequent tennis playing is associated with increased plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations and that this relationship is independent of other factors known to alter plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration.",Immunology

Precise localization, detection, and recognition of minor changes in testicular lesions are important because teratocarcinoma is notorious for manifesting as secondaries at the time the primary site is obvious to the clinician. In the past, questionable enlargement of the testis due to significant pathology required numerous radiographic invasive special procedures to provide a correct diagnosis. Due to the advent of the sophisticated digital ultrasound imager with high frequency quarter wave transducer, it is possible to detect minor changes in the tissue character of the testis, thus enabling the physician to tackle primary neoplasms prior to distant spread.In our case we were able to detect the abnormality in the testis, but unfortunately a large secondary abnormal mass was present.

7400974,"Comparison of the biotransformation and hepatotoxicity of halothane and deuterated halothane. To investigate the effect of deuterium substitution on the biotransformation and hepatotoxicity of halothane, male, phenobarbital-pretreated rats were exposed for 2 hr to 1% halothane or deuterated halothane (d-halothane) delivered in 14% O2-85% N2. The exposures were performed at mildly hypoxic conditions (14% O2) since it was previously established that the decreased oxygen tension promotes both the reductive metabolism of halothane and halothane-induced liver injury. At the end of anesthesia or at 24 hr, the rats were sarificed so that blood, liver and urine samples could be obtained for measurement of metabolites and assessment of liver damage. Deuterium substitution did not affect the levels of reductive metabolites of halothane (fluoride, CF3CH2Cl and CF2CHCl) nor did it alter the degree of hepatotoxicity as assessed by serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase levels and morphological examination. The levels of oxidative metabolites (CF3COOH and bromide) were significantly reduced at the end of anesthesia and at 24 hr. It is concluded that halothane-induced hepatotoxicity is initiated by reactive intermediates formed during its reductive metabolism and that cleavage of the C-H bond is not involved in this pathway. The oxidative biotransformation of halothane proceeds by an oxygen insertion reaction at the C-H bond. Thus, the increased stability of the C-D bond explains the reduction in oxidative metabolities observed after exposure to d-halothane.",Immunology
7400963,"Clonidine-induced diuresis in the rat: evidence for a renal site of action. Clonidine, an alpha adrenergic agonist which causes a diuresis in experimental animals, was studied in unanesthetized, conscious Brattleboro rats heterozygous or homozygous for hereditary hypothalamic diabetes insipidus to determine if the diuresis was due to alpha adrenergic inhibition of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release or to another mechanism of action. Heterozygous rats given clonidine s.c. in doses of 50 to 300 mu/kg b.w. exhibited a prompt dose-related diuresis. The diuresis was transient and could not be maintained beyond 4 hr even when clonidine was administered continuously by s.c. osmotic minipump. In response to clonidine-induced diuresis, plasma osmolality increased acutely from 300 +/- 1 to 310 +/- 1 mOsM/kg by 60 min after injection. Base-line plasma ADH was 5.1 +/- 0.9 mu/ml, remained unchanged at 15 min after clonidine injection but increased to 21.6 +/- 7.2 muU/ml by 60 min and was accompanied by an increase in urinary ADH excretion from 19.6 +/- 3.7 to 48.6 +/- 5.3 muU/hr. In parallel with the drug-induced diuresis, there was an increase in urinary excretion of creatinine, sodium and total solute. The alpha blocking agent phenoxybenzamine did not prevent the diuresis after clonidine injection. Clonidine antagonized the antidiuresis after clonidine injection. Clonidine antagonized the antidiuretic action of ADH administered to rats homozygous for diabetes insipidus. Thus, clonidine-induced diuresis does not appear to be due to alpha adrenergic inhibition of ADH release but rather to direct renal effects.",Immunology
7400747,"An interaction between dorsal and ventral regions of the marginal zone in early amphibian embryos. When small explants from early gastrulae of Xenopus laevis are allowed to develop in a buffered salt solution there is a considerable difference between the patterns of differentiation obtained from different dorsoventral levels of the marginal zone. These patterns of differentiation correspond to the fates of the different regions in the course of normal development. They are not altered if several explants of the same type are fused before culture. If a ventral marginal zone explant from Xenopus is cultured in contact with a piece of dorsal marginal zone from the axolotl, it forms structures more dorsal in character than it would in isolation or in normal development. This behaviour is shown only feebly with other regions of the axolotl gastrula. A piece of dorsal marginal zone from Xenopus is not affected in its development by culture in contact with an explant of ventral marginal zone from the axolotl. The dorsalization of ventral marginal zone explants is shown only if there is a large area of direct contact with the dorsal explant and if the pieces remain in contact for a period of 48 h or more. It is proposed that this in vitro interaction is the same as the dorsoventral component of action of the 'organizer' graft discovered by Spermann and Mangold.",Immunology
7400737,"Effects of juvenile hormone, ecdysterone, actinomycin D, and mitomycin C on the cuticular proteins of Tenebrio molitor. Juvenile hormone (JH), ecdysterone and some antibiotics cause Tenebrio molitor to form a second pupa or pupal-adult intermediate. Incorporation of labelled leucine into the cuticular proteins of JH-induced second pupae did not differ from incorporation in normal pupae, and the soluble cuticular proteins from these young second pupae were indentical to those extracted from normal pupal exocuticle when analysed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, as these second pupae aged, the major early bands did not undergo a normal decrease in staining intensity, indicating a JH effect on protein insolubilization (sclerotization). The transport of protein into the cuticle may also have been altered by JH; electrophoretic analysis of the new cuticle of treated animals showed intense staining of bands with RF's similar to those of blood proteins. The new exocuticle produced after treatment of pupae with ecdysterone had soluble proteins which were typical of normal pupae, but extracts from such animals aged prior to cuticle removal yielded bands characteristic of normal adults. Pupae treated with actinomycin D occasionally form new abdominal cuticle with characteristic pupal morphology. These cuticles yielded soluble proteins which, upon analysis, had pupal, pupal and adult, or adult banding patterns. Animals treated with mitomycin C, although retaining vestiges of pupal abdominal characters, had adult cuticular proteins.",Immunology

The cell samples from patients with bladder carcinoma could be distinguished from normal by 2 features: 1) an increase in the proportion of bladder epithelial cells with more than diploid deoxyribonucleic acid and 2) aneuploid cell peaks.

Previous studies showed hyperre-sponsiveness to human growth hormone (hGH) in men with myotonic or limb girdle dystrophies (MMD or LGD). Because polyamines may mediate some actions of hGH, we have now investigated polyamine metabolism in these and other dystrophies. Under metabolic balance study conditions, serum and urine levels of putrescine (Pu), spermidine (Sd), spermine (Sm), and cadaverine (Cd) were measured in six normal men (36-44 yr), four men with MMD (38-44 yr), and three men with LGD (30-36 yr), before and during treatment with 0.532 U/kg body wt ((3/4)/d) of hGH. Daily balances of N, P, and K were also monitored. In the normal subjects, hGH did not influence elemental balances or serum and urine polyamines. In MMD, hGH caused significant retention of N, P, and K (P < 0.005). Basal levels of Sm and Cd were significantly elevated above normal (P < 0.005), and Pu, Sm, and Cd increased two- to fourfold above basal during hGH treatment (P < 0.005). In LGD, hGH also caused retention of N, P, and K. Basal levels of nearly all the polyamines (not serum Pu) were significantly above normal in serum and urine (P < 0.05). During hGH treatment, all four polyamines rose significantly above basal (P < 0.005). Serum and urine polyamine levels in five boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, age 8-13, did not differ from those in five age-matched normal boys. Skeletal muscle polyamines were measured in five men (31-40 yr) without muscle disease and in three men with LGD (30-38 yr). Average concentrations of Pu, Sd, Sm, and Cd were 46, 306, 548, and 61 nmol/g wet wt in LGD and 1, 121, 245, and 14 in the normal subjects, respectively (P < 0.05 in each instance). Polyamines were determined in skeletal muscle, liver, kidney, and brain of male mice with hereditary muscular dystrophy and in age- and sex-matched normal controls. Pu, Sd, Sm, and Cd levels were two to three times higher than normal in muscle, but did not differ in liver, kidney, and brain. Similar findings were made in male hamsters with hereditary dystrophy and in their controls. The abnormality in hamster muscle polyamines appeared between 1 and 6 wk of age and persisted or intensified until 30 wk. These data reveal abnormalities of polyamine metabolism in men with MMD, in men with LGD, and in mice or hamsters with hereditary muscular dystrophy.

7115881,"Structural and dipolar properties of the voltage-dependent pore former alamethicin in octanol/dioxane. Dielectric constant and loss of the membrane-active peptide alamethicin in octanol/dioxane mixtures have been measured at frequencies between 5 kHz and 50 MHz. On the basis of a rotational mechanism of dipolar orientation, the observed dispersion provides information regarding size, shape, and dipole moment of the structural entities which the solute may assume in media of diverse lipophilicity. Particularly detailed results are obtained in a pure octanol solvent where an apparent molecular weight of alamethicin could be determined. It turns out that in this quite lipophilic medium most of the peptide material exists as a monomer particle that has approximate length and diameter of 35 and 13 A, respectively. It carries a dipole moment of approximately 75 Debye units (directed nearly parallel to the long axis). At our concentrations of a few milligrams per milliliters, appreciable formation of dimers by head-to-tail linkage is indicated. When the octanol content is reduced by adding greater amounts of dioxane, larger particles are encountered. This is accompanied by a decrease of the effective polarity. The inherent increase of hydrophilicity in the dioxane-enriched solvent apparently favors another monomer conformation that has a low dipole moment and easily aggregates to some kind of micelle.",Immunology

7115879,"Dynamic depolarization of interacting fluorophores. Effect of internal rotation and energy transfer. Effects of internal rotation on the fluorescence decay functions and time-dependent anisotropies of fluorophores bound to a spherical macromolecule are theoretically investigated in the presence of the intramolecular energy transfer interaction by solving relevant rotational diffusion equations. The model system examined is one in which the energy donor is internally rotating around an axis fixed at the macromolecule and the acceptor is fixed at a definite position in the macromolecule. The effect of internal rotation in the system is described by Hill's functions with two cosine terms. The fluorescence decay function and anisotropy decay are functions of the ratio of energy-transfer probability averaged over the internal rotation angle to the rotary diffusion co-efficient. When the internal rotation is much faster than energy transfer, the decay function of the donor is predicted to be a single exponential, and the anisotropy decay is essentially described by the expression derived by Gotlieb and Wahl (1963. J. Chim. Phys. 60:849-856). However, deviation from it becomes pronounced as the rotation becomes slower. Methods of numerical analysis are presented for decay function and anisotropy decay, as well as relative quantum yield and polarization anisotropy under steady-state excitation, and examined for a simplified system under the variation of the diffusion coefficient.",Immunology

The antidepressant effect of amitriptyline was studied in 28 endogenous depressive patients. They received 150 mg amitriptyline once nightly in a sustained release form for 4 weeks. Blood samples were drawn 12 hrs. after medication. Amitriptyline concentrations were between 35--300 ng/ml Nortriptyline concentrations were between 20--330 ng/ml. No correlations were found between plasma concentrations of amitriptyline, nortriptyline, or their sum, and the clinical outcome of treatment. Plasma levels of amitriptyline depended on neither the age nor the sex of the patients. A significant correlation was found between the ratio of nortriptyline to amitriptyline concentrations in serum (demethylation ratio) and clinical improvement. The demethylation ratio appeared to be relatively constant after a few days of treatment. The results suggest that monitoring the demethylation ratio of endogenous depressive patients treated with amitriptyline may predict therapeutic effects of the treatment. They also suggest that a balance between noradrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms is necessary to improve antidepressant treatment with amitriptyline.",Immunology

Twenty three hour fluid deprived rats were offered a novel 0.125% saccharin solution and then were injected with either 3.0 mEq/kg LiCl or 0.9% saline. On the first test day after conditioning the animals were injected with either 60 mg/kg sodium phenobarbital, 80 mg/kg sodium barbital, 30 mg/kg sodium amobarbital, 20 mg/kg sodium secobarbital, 9 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital or 0.9% saline, 15 min prior to the drinking session. Results indicate that only 9 mg/kg pentobarbital, 60 mg/kg phenobarbital, and 80 mg/kg barbital were effective in attenuating the LiCl induced saccharin aversion on the day of administration. In addition, dipsogenic effects for only 60 mg/kg phenobarbital and 30 mg/kg amobarbital were observed in the saline treated control groups. A synergistic interaction between the effects of LiCl and sodium phenobarbital, barbital, and secobarbital was also observed. Lithium chloride plus these barbiturates resulted in a longer term aversion to saccharin than LiCl alone and no barbiturate produced saccharin aversion when administered without LiCl.",Immunology

Caldolyticus was purified to about 91% homogeneity. The molar mass of the enzyme was determined as 73 000 daltons and it is composed of two subunits, each with a molar mass of 37 000. Initial velocity studies with oxaloacetic acid and NADH as substrates at pH 8.1, over a range of temperatures, indicates that the enzyme operates via a sequential type mechanism. Van't Hoff plots of the kinetic parameters displayed sharp changes in slope at characteristic temperatures, whereas the Arrhenius plot exhibited no such breaks over the temperature interval investigated. The enzyme was found to be stable at 41 degrees C and lower temperatures. At 51 degrees C and 59 degrees C an almost immediate 20% reduction in activity was obtained, but no further inactivation occurred during the 60 min of incubation. At 59 degrees C the enzyme lost 50% of its initial activity in about 38 s. High concentration of NADH was observed to greatly stabilize the enzyme at that temperature. It is suggested that the slope changes in the Van't Hoff plots and the stability profiles at 51 degrees C and 59 degrees C are representative of a temperature induced conformational change in the enzyme.",Immunology

We have investigated capping in lymphocytes from 19 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, 13 carriers, 8 patients' sisters, 14 patients' aunts and 52 normal controls. All 19 patients showed a reduction in capping both with fluorescein conjugated polyvalent goat antiserum (mean +/- SD = 18.5 +/- 5.1% and with fluorescein labeled Concanavalin A (mean +/- SD = 10.8 +/- 3.1%) as compared to controls.

The spontaneous contractions observed with both groups reflected the occurrence of membrane spikes. Tetrodotoxin (3 c 10(-6) M) did not change the membrane potential in any organ studied nor did it affect the pattern of spontaneous contractions. Verapamil (5 x 10(-6) M) increased the membrane potential of the muscles from castrated and stilbestrol-treated castrated animals, abolished the membrane spikes and blocked the spontaneous contractions.

The means by which a unique lymphokine imparts to macrophages the capacity to ingest complement- (C) coated particles was explored. In contrast to other previously described lymphokines that influence macrophage behavior, the T cell product that enhances macrophage C receptor function was found to act immediately upon contact with macrophages and to be of substantially lower apparent m.w. than either MIF, MAF, lymphotoxin, or interferon. Evidence is presented that indicates that the lymphokine does not act by causing a generalized increase in plasma membrane phagocytic activity or by enhancing phagocytosis mediated by other immunologic receptors. Nor does the lymphokine act by inducing the synthesis of new protein receptors. Our findings suggest that the more likely possibilities by which the lymphokine acts include induction of an increased rate of insertion of C receptors into the macrophage plasma membrane, induction of a rearrangement of C receptors within the macrophage plasma membrane, or a qualitative alteration of the function of existing macrophage C receptors in their relationship with the intracellular machinery involved in phagocytosis.",Immunology

Spleen cells from 8-week-old, nonimmunized donor chickens can transfer resistance to a supralethal dose of the JMV leukemia line of Marek's disease (MD) to newly hatched, highly susceptible, histocompatible recipients. The population of cells transferring resistance has previously been shown to be non-T, non-B, and nonmacrophage in nature. We present data here showing that heavily x-irradiated spleen cells were unable to protect recipients from leukemia challenge. Both complement receptor-bearing and -lacking cells could confer resistance to newly hatched recipients. Fc receptor-bearing cells conferred significant protection to recipients, whereas spleen cells depleted of Fc receptor-bearing cells were unable to protect chickens from death after JMV challenge. This indicates that the population of spleen cells, which is moderately radiosensitive and which possesses Fc receptors, is responsible for the transfer of natural resistance to the malignancy in vivo.",Immunology

The proportion of overall agreement, i.e. the proportion of coincident opinions, was 86% to 89%. Results were also analysed by using the kappa statistic, which corrects for agreement due to chance. Kappa values ranged from 0.67 to 0.73. These values indicate higher levels of inter-observer agreement than those recorded for many other radiological examinations and are much greater than those noted by others for inter-observer variation in the recognition of renal scarring in urograms in adults. The likely explanations for these high levels of agreement are discussed. Observers disagreed about the extent of scarring in one-third of cases.

The proposed mechanisms responsible for these alterations in vascular resistance include humoral factors, the nervous system and local autoregulatory events. This study focuses on the potential importance of the phenomenon of tissue autoregulation as a factor in vascular resistance. Nearly all individual organ systems can locally adjust their vascular resistance (autoregulate) to maintain appropriate blood flow, so that the sum of all the tissue resistances determines the total blood flow through the circulation (cardiac output). The extent to which these local autoregulatory mechanisms can influence hemodynamic events associated with various types of hypertension is evaulated. It is concluded that even slight fluid retention over periods of weeks and months enables autoregulatory mechanisms to sustain a 50 per cent increase in arterial pressure with only a 5 per cent observed increase in cardiac output. In some forms of hypertension, these mechanisms appear to explain the observed hemodynamic changes (i.e., low renin essential hypertension or primary aldosteronism). In other forms, there may be no reason for autoregulation to occur, so the mechanism might be of no consequence in determining the vascular resistance. The evidence indicates that regulation of cardiac output cannot explain the cause of hypertension, but local autoregulation of flow must be carefully considered if we are to understand fully the hemodynamic events associated with various forms of hypertension.",Immunology

Responses to isoprenaline were not potentiated by extraneuronal uptake (ENU) inhibitor drugs (phenoxybenzamine and metanephrine) in preparations of guinea-pig uterus which were contracted by K+-Krebs solution. Fluorescence histochemical experiments demonstrated that isoprenaline could accumulate extraneuronally in uterine smooth muscle and that this accumulation was inhibited by phenoxybenzamine and metanephrine. However, accumulation was also inhibited by K+-Krebs solution. Therefore, it was concluded that the failure of ENU inhibitor drugs to potentiate isoprenaline responses on K+-depolarized uterine preparations might occur because the uptake mechanism had already been inhibited by the K+-Krebs solution. Support for this hypothesis was obtained from experiments on guinea-pig tracheal preparations in which ENU inhibitor drugs had previously been shown to potentiate isoprenaline responses. In K+-depolarized tracheal preparations this potentiation did not occur presumably because the K+-Krebs solution had already inhibited the uptake. Thus K+-depolarization of a tissue may provide an alternative to the use of extraneuronal uptake inhibitor drugs when it is necessary to eliminate this site of loss in quantitative studies on beta-adrenoceptors in isolated tissues.",Immunology

7242905,"Intraneural ganglion: a case report with electron microscopic observations. We report a case of common peroneal mononeuropathy caused by an intraneural ganglion in a 9-year-old boy. The mass and the contiguous nerve fascicles were excised under the operating microscope. Histologically, the cyst wall was composed of layers of elongated cells merging with fascicles that exhibited changes suggestive of a pressure-ischemia effect. Electron microscopy showed that the cells forming cyst wall were myofibroblasts, similar to the cells found in ganglia arising from joints elsewhere in the body. A review of the English literature on intraneural ganglia discloses 44 additional cases, of which 86% involved the common peroneal nerve. The most common clinical feature was motor dysfunction (followed by pain, sensory loss, and the presence of a palpable mass), and a significant male predominance is noted. The pathogenesis of this nerve lesion is discussed in light of our findings.",Immunology

A group of 10 nonproductive schizophrenics (i.e., not experiencing hallucinations, delusions, or mood swings) was compared with a group of 10 nonpsychotic alcoholics, matched on visual acuity and reading level, in a primed word identification task. Subsets of three target words were projected onto a series of screens constructed in such a way that an increasing random proportion of the words' features were made visible. The prime was the category to which the target words belonged; the target words represented one of four levels of goodness-of-membership in the primed category. On the whole, identification thresholds in the two groups were not significantly different. However, although the alcoholics' thresholds increased rapidly as goodness-of-membership decreased, this trend was not significant in the schizophrenic group. When the target words were poor members of the primed category, the schizophrenics' thresholds were significantly lower than the alcoholics'. Such results are consistent with Feigenberg's characterization of schizophrenia as a disturbance in the process of probabilistic prognosis.",Immunology

Isolated rat liver nuclear matrices have been partially separated by means of mild sonication into a matrix protein (matricin) fraction and a residual ribonucleoprotein (RNP) fraction. The initial matricin fraction is composed largely of protein (91.1%) but also contains significant amounts of DNA (8.4%). Reconstruction experiments indicate that this DNA is not the result of the artifactual binding of DNA to the matrix during the extraction procedures. Subsequent treatment with DNase I results in purified matricin composed of greater than 99.5% protein. SDS acrylamide gel electrophoresis of the matrix protein fibrils reveals only three bands: the primary matrix polypeptides of 62,000, 66,000, and 70,000 daltons. Electron microscopy demonstrates a diffuse reticulum with fibrils as thin as 30--50 A and the presence of 80--100-A globular structures. The residual RNP fraction is composed largely of protein (80.1%) and RNA (19.5%), with only traces of DNA (1.1%). Over 98% of the total matrix-associated RNA is recovered in this fraction. SDS acrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates an enrichment in both low and high molecular weight secondary matrix polypeptides, although the 60,000--70,000-dalton polypeptides are present in significant amounts as well.

A lactose-extractable lectin obtained from 14--16-d embryonic chick pectoral muscle and myotube muscle cultures by affinity chromatography inhibited myotube formation in culture. When applied to muscle cultures at 0.09 micrograms/ml, the purified lectin produced variable effects on the inhibition of myotube formation related to the time and length of application, suggesting that components of the culture medium and/or temperature produced inactivation. Hemagglutination assays showed that the lectin was inactivated by horse serum and by chick embryo extract but not by L-15 salt solution at 4 degrees C. Incubation in L-15 solution at 37 degrees C with or without 2 mM dithiothreitol resulted in inactivation in 2--3 h. To maximize the effect of the lectin on the inhibition of myotube formation, primary muscle cultures were grown in low [Ca+2] medium to inhibit fusion, and then [Ca+2] was increased to elicit fusion in the absence and presence of lectin with solution renewal every 2 h. Without lectin, myotube formation was normal, whereas, with lectin, it was inhibited by 93%. Continued incubation at 37 degrees C. without renewal of lectin resulted in myotube formation, suggesting reversibility by lectin inactivation.",Immunology

The effect of membrane potential on the Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity of isolated sarcolemmal vesicles from dog ventricles is examined. Na+-Ca2+ exchange is monitored as Nai+-dependent Ca2+ uptake as described by Reeves and Sutko ((1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76,590-594). Membrane potential is controlled by varying internal and external K+ in the presence of valinomycin. Inside-positive potentials stimulate Nai+-dependent Ca2+ influx. This stimulation is independent of Ca2+ concentration. The results indicate that Na+-Ca2+ exchange by itself can generate a substantial potential (approximately -60mV) in the sarcolemmal vesicles. The data are consistent with an electrogenic Na+-Ca2+ exchange mechanism in which three or more Na+ are exchanged for one Ca2+. This electrogenic exchange may have important implications in the control of myocardial tension development.",Immunology

Twenty-four hour profiles of circulating prolactin have been documented in eight boys with simple delayed puberty, eleven with gynaecomastia, three of whom were retested following its spontaneous resolution, and two normal adult men. Mean 24 h prolactin levels in four boys with delayed puberty and ten with gynaecomastia exceeded the mean levels for the two adult men. A sleep-associated rise in prolactin levels occurred at all stages of puberty irrespective of the presence or absence of gynaecomastia, and in some subjects peaks also occurred during the daytime. Boys with gynaecomastia had higher 24 h means levels of prolactin (P less than 0.05), higher daytime levels (P less than 0.05) and higher sleep-associated levels (P less than 0.05) than did control subjects. These were not related to the degree or duration of the gynaecomastia, but 24 h mean levels of prolactin and oestradiol were positively correlated. In one subject who had had transient galactorrhoea, high levels of circulating prolactin, oestrone and oestradiol fell following spontaneous resolution of the gynaecomastia. We believe that oestrogen: androgen imbalance during the daytime is the major cause of pubertal gynaecomastia, with hyperprolacinaemia (which may cause galactorrhoea) sometimes occurring as a response to relative hyperoestrogenaemia.",Immunology

In this study, we investigated the effects of lithocholic acid on the DNA of mouse lymphoblastoma L1210 cells. Incubation of L1210 cells with lithocholic acid (2.5 X 10(-4) M) at 37 degrees for 30 min and for 1 hr resulted in the appearance of single-strand breaks in the DNA. This was demonstrated by sedimentation of nucleoids in neutral sucrose gradients and by alkaline elution. The DNA damage was repaired upon incubation of the cells in fresh medium lacking lithocholic acid. These results suggest that DNA repair efficiency is an important function for the population of cells which are constantly exposed to low concentrations of lithocholic acid. The presence of even a low level of persistent damage could lead to significant biological consequences including mutations and the induction of error-prone repair processes.",Immunology

Glycoproteins of a metastasizing line of B16 mouse melanoma and a poorly metastasizing wheat germ agglutinin-resistant clone were compared. Cell surface proteins and glycoproteins were isotopically labeled by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination and by NaB3H4 reduction after oxidation by periodate or galactose oxidase and subsequently analyzed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Differences were observed in the relative mobilities of several major cell surface components. Binding of 125I-labeled lectins to total cellular proteins on polyacrylamide gels following electrophoresis showed that the major wheat germ agglutinin-binding components of F1 cells were altered in Wa-4 cells. Similar differences were not observed in concanavalin A-binding components. Total cellular glycopeptides were analyzed after separation into structurally distinct classes. The acidic ""complex"" N-glycosidic glycopeptides from the resistant cells were of lower molecular weight than those from the parent cells. No differences were observed among the mannose-rich N-glycosidic glycopeptides or the alkali-labile O-glycosidic oligosaccharides. Structural studies involving methylation analysis revealed that in the altered glycopeptides of the resistant cells the amount of neuraminic acid residues was decreased to one-half, concomitant with an increase in the amount of fucose. The lost sialic acid was bound to C-3 of galactose, whereas the increased fucose was found on C-3 of 4-substituted N-acetylglucosamine.

Using a transplantable mammary adenocarcinoma in a rat-TPN model, the relative effect of different exogenous intravenous nutrients on tumor growth and host maintenance was studied. Relative to chow controls, starvation increased host depletion without reducing tumor growth. Adequate carbohydrate calories alone neither improved host maintenance nor stimulated tumor growth, yet adequate amino acids alone did improve host maintenance but also stimulated tumor growth. Adequate amino acids and carbohydrates given simultaneously maximized both host maintenance and tumor growth. In contrast, an isocaloric, isonitrogenous, intravenous diet providing non-nitrogenous calories as fat promoted host maintenance equivalent to carbohydrate-based TPN with no tumor stimulation. This apparent differential utilization of fat calories by normal and malignant cells may permit manipulation of the relative benefit of parenteral nutrition to host or to tumor, permitting host repletion without tumor stimulation or alternatively tumor stimulation at appropriate times to increase sensitivity to phase-specific antineoplastic therapy.",Immunology

The pA(2) for the latter agent is similar to that observed at 37 degrees C in intestinal smooth muscle. No evidence of a relaxant population of H2 receptors was encountered. Unlike that of intestinal smooth muscle, the response of strips of renal artery becomes progressively diminished at temperatures below about 20 degrees C, and the effect of reduced temperature on receptor subtype is thus more difficult to assess.

The present study was designed to determine if the same or different side chain oxidation systems are used by these compounds in the bile fistula hamster model. Although a single injection of [3H]THCA is nearly completely metabolized into cholic acid, only about 50% is converted into cholic acid when THCA is infused at a rate of 0.083 mumol/min. The remainder is excreted in the bile unchanged indicating saturation of the side chain oxidation system. Fifty-nine +/- 1.1% (+/- 1SEM) of a single injection of [3H]DHCA is metabolized into chenodeoxycholic acid in bile fistula hamsters infused with either saline or cholic acid at a rate of 0.083 mumol/min.

However, when [3H]DHCA was administered during an 0.083 mumol/min infusion of THCA, only 39.0 +/- 4.5% of the radioactivity in bile was identified as chenodeoxycholic acid.

The complication rate was least for staged second neck dissections (17 patients). While overall surgical and medical complication rates for simultaneous bilateral neck dissections (11 patients) were greater than those after staged and delayed (53 patients) neck dissections, surgical complication rates alone for these three groups were comparable. The combined group of patients treated aggressively by simultaneous or staged second neck dissection had no greater complication rate than patients (ten) treated by second neck dissection when metastasis became clinically evident later. These findings and evidence that 55% of these patients were alive after five years or died of unrelated causes encourage us to support more aggressive surgical therapy in patients with manifest or likely occult bilateral metastases from a head and neck primary carcinoma.",Immunology

The first ten patients were healed by using bismuth-iodoform, and the following 100 patients were treated using the hemihydrate of calcium sulfate (CaSO4.2H3O). Both alloplasts were replaced in all patients by normal healthy cancellous bone within two to four months. It is a safe procedure in which bone regeneration is stimulated to a maximum rate. During June 1974, bismuth-iodoform was used as an allograft. On July 9, 1974, the first three operations in the history of otorhinolaryngology, to my knowledge, were performed using CaSO4. Normal physiologic absorption of CaSO4 occurs with the simultaneous deposition of autogenous cancellous bone.

Reported fluctuations in normal thyroidal iodine uptake over the past decade, as well as possible radiation injury with 131I, prompted examination of uptake values in a normal population using 123I. The normal range defined in 100 euthyroid subjects was 1% to 8.8% at two hours, and 4% to 27% for the 24-hour uptake. These results are significantly lower than observed eight years ago in this area.

The effects of administering drugs 2 days after antigen sensitization in a combined model of delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) and humoral immunity (HI) in the mouse are described and compared with a previous study in which drugs were administered prior to sensitization using the same model. Low doses of cyclophosphamide (CY) administered after antigen sensitization were found to enhance DTH to methylated bovine serum albumin (MBSA). In addition, high doses of this drug suppressed DTH for 3 days after challenge, and then enhanced the response for a further 5 days. The HI response to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) was simultaneously suppressed by a range of CY doses. A number of different drug types demonstrated a similar pattern of dose-dependent DTH effects. However, unlike the previous study DTH enhancement was not confined to the alkylating agents. Either DTH enhancement or suppression was also observed after treatment with a number of other drugs. HI was suppressed by several drugs, in particular by a number of alkylating agents and anti-metabolites. Selective effects on one or other limbs of the immune response were observed.

This effect of terodiline could be reversed by high concentrations of calcium. Within the same concentration range, terodiline also reduced potassium-induced 45Ca influx in isolated aorta without affecting calcium efflux.

On both the 15th and 21st day of pregnancy the numbers of live and resorbed foetuses and the weights of placentas in the lesioned groups did not differ statistically as compared with the control group. Interestingly, the lesioned group showed an increase in the number of ovulating cells on the one hand, and decrease in the number of implantations on the other.

Examination of 65 patients with ischemic heart disease (61 males and 4 females) whose ages ranged from 29 to 59 was conducted. Selective coronarography demonstrated stenosing atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries in 34 patients and intact coronary vessels in 31. Correlation analysis of the exercise tolerance value depending on the degree of the overall affection of the heart arteries revealed a reverse dependence (r = -0.68) between these indices. The criterion for discontinuing exercise tolerance tests on a bicycle ergometer in patients with involvement of the coronary arteries in atherosclerosis were changes in the ECG in 67.6% and an attack of angina pectoris in 85,3% of cases. In the group of individuals with intact coronary vessels and positive exercise tolerance test 41.7% had changes on the ECG and 79,6% had an attack of angina. It is shown that in patients with ischemic heart disease whose coronary arteries are intact or involved in atherosclerosis, angina pectoris is more sensitive as a criterion of myocardial ischemia than the changes on the ECG.",Immunology

Theoretical expressions have been derived for the contributions to ionisation density in cavity chambers from secondary electrons arising from photon absorption in wall, build-up cap and surrounding medium. The method allows the derivation of C lambda and displacement factors, which are evaluated for the Farmer graphite chamber for a range of photon beams. Differences between C lambda values calculated for air-walled and water-walled chambers are found to be consistent with those determined by Nahum and Greening. The currently recommended displacement factor for the Farmer chamber with cap, however, is found to be in error by about 0.8%. On the basis of a comparison between theoretically predicted air doses in cavities and the experimental results of Fregene it is proposed that no further correction to C lambda is required for the chamber 'effective point of measurement'.",Immunology

Cytochrome b-561 (Enteromorpha prolifera) was extracted from a green alga, E. prolifera, by immersion of the dried thalli in phosphate buffer solution. Purification was carried out by ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-cellulose and DEAE-Sephadex column chromatographies, Bio-Gel gel filtration, and hydroxyapatite column chromatography. The reduced form of the cytochrome exhibited absorption maxima at 561 (alpha), 530.5 (beta), and 428.5 nm (gamma), and the oxidized form at 530.5, 417 (gamma), and 275 nm. The alpha-band of the reduced form was symmetric without any shoulder. The pyridine hemochrome showed absorption maxima at 556, 524, and 418 nm. The cytochrome does not combine with carbon monoxide or cyanide. The cytochrome showed little peroxidase activity. The cytochrome is oxidized by ferricyanide and reduced by cysteine, ascorbate, and hydrosulfite. Ferrocyanide and hydroquinone do not completely reduce it. Autoxidation of the cytochrome was found to be very slow. The midpoint potential (Em) of the cytochrome was determined by equilibration with the ferro- and ferri-EDTA system to be +0.23 volt at pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C. The molecular weight of the cytochrome, estimated by Sephadex gel filtration, was 67 x 10(3).",Immunology

Trypsin [EC 3.4.21.4]-catalyzed hydrolysis of ""inverse substrates"" was investigated kinetically. ""Inverse substrates"" for trypsin are specific substrates in which the arrangement of the site-specific group is reversed compared to that of the normal substrate, e.g., a cationic center is included in the leaving group instead of being in the acyl moiety (Tanizawa, K., Kasaba, Y., & Kanaoka, Y. (1977) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 99, 4485-4488). Acyl enzyme intermediates formed specifically from these substrates are advantageous for the mechanistic analysis of trypsin action, since the cationic group liberated from the acyl moiety can no longer exhibit specific interaction with the enzyme binding site in the subsequent deacylation stage. Remarkable rate acceleration at the deacylation step was observed on adding amidinium or ammonium compounds. The effects of the size of the acyl moiety and the charged molecule on the acceleration were examined. Latent properties of 1-butylamine as an activator were found in the present study. Based on these observations, it is suggested that a cationic molecule which can be well accommodated together with the acyl group within the active center cleft causes rate enhancement, with associated conformational changes.",Immunology

Following iv injection of 0.5 g galactose per kg body weight, together with 2 mu Ci generally 14C-labelled galactose, 14CO2 is collected in regular intervals during one hour. Since 14C-activity in breath exhibits a linear rise during 70--100 minutes, the curve obtained permits calculation of an initial slope, as well as the ""standardized specific activity"" after 45 min GBT was performed in 8 liver normals, 8 alcoholic cirrhotics, 4 patients with chronic active hepatitis (CAH) and 6 with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). The results were compared with the simultaneously measured galactose elimination capacity (GEC) and the initial plasma disappearance (ki) of bromsulphthalein (BSP). In the liver normals, the values for initial slope and standardized specific activity were 1.08 +/- S.D. 0.3 and 0.42 +/- S.D. 0.1, respectively. In comparison, the values obtained in all patients groups were markedly reduced. CAH patients exhibited the most severe decrease; the reduction was smallest in PBC patients. The GBT discriminated well between liver normals and patients with liver disease (p less than 0.001, t-test). The results of the GBT correlated linearly with GEC (r = 0.86 and 0.87, respectively) and with BSP-ki (r = 0.9 and 0.92, respectively).

The present study examined the relationship between changes in couples' perceptions of each other during a conflictual interaction and their mode of conflict resolution. Thirty-three volunteer married couples were videotaped while recreating a conflictual interaction that had occurred previously. During a subsequent replaying of the videotape, husbands' and wives' verbal descriptions of perceptions of self and spouse were elicited at three different stages of the conflict, using a method for eliciting perceptions derived from Laing. Phillipson, and Lee's multiperspective interpersonal perception technique. The interpersonal perceptions of couples who resolved the conflict by engaging the issue at hand were contrasted with those of couples who resolved the conflict via avoidance. Statistically significant differences were found between the groups, suggesting that engaging the issue was associated with an increase in spouses' access to one another's interpersonal perceptions, whereas avoidance was associated with decreases in consensually valid perceptions. Substantive and methodological implications of the study are discussed.",Immunology

Progressive encephalopathy with characteristic clinical features and electroencephalographic findings has been reported many times in adult patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis. Two children with chronic renal failure developed a similar encephalopathy prior to their second birthdays and before the initiation of dialysis. Both children required parathyroidectomy for control of severe hyperparathyroidism with persistent hypercalcemia. Slight improvement followed this procedure in one patient. Selected biochemical abnormalities in serum and in brain tissue specimens were compared to those of neurologically unaffected children. Results of thes studies suggest that a direct toxic effect of either aluminum or calcium on the brain does not play an etiologic role in this disorder.,Immunology

Comparing several antibiotics and different bone cements, the mixture of Palacos R (polymethylmethacrylate, PMMA) with gentamicin proved to be the most suitable one as far as a high and sustained release of the antibiotic from the artificial resin is concerned. A continuous leaching of gentamicin was observed for more than 5 years. Gentamicin proved to be stable in Palacos R for the whole period of time. The release of 12 antibiotics from Palacos R was evaluated in vitro. Four other bone cements were included in this study as well, in order to evaluate the leaching of gentamicin from these materials. The combination Gentamicin-Palacos R (GP) showed a 2--3 fold higher and much more prolonged release than did the other mixtures. From this investigation, which also included studies of commercially available antibiotic bone cement mixtures, it is quite obvious that there exist distinct differences in the various bone cements as well as in the various antibiotics as regards their qualification for use in alloarthroplasty. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients after implantation of GP showed low gentamicin concentrations in serum (on average 1.8 microgram/ml) and urine. However, in wound exudate, derived directly from the vicinity of the implanted cement, gentamicin concentrations up to 150 micrograms/ml were observed. Also in tissue samples from the vicinity of the implant, high concentrations were measurable for a long period of time (up to 5 1/2 years).",Immunology

The purpose of this study was to assess prospectively the initial results of total knee replacement with the standard spherocentric component and to identify retrospectively the pathogenesis of any unsatisfactory results. As a consequence of this study, the femoral component was modified. Thirty-six knees were reviewed twenty-two to fifty-two months after a standard spherocentric total knee replacement, with a mean follow-up of thirty-five months. Twenty-five (70 per cent) of the knees had significant relief of pain and improved function. Eleven knees were not improved because of confirmed loosening in five, supracondylar fracture in two, infection in one, and suspected loosening in three. Ten of these eleven complications became manifest within the first postoperative year. Alignment in the coronal plane was not consistently precise and hyperextension was a recurrent problem in twelve of the thirty-six knees. A modification in the femoral component was made: the stem was lengthened to 10.0 centimeters and the body was reoriented so that there was 5 degrees of valgus and 15 more degrees of posterior rotation than the original design. This modified prosthesis was used in twenty-five additional knees, with definite improvement in alignment, but the follow-up was insufficient to ascertain the effect of the modification on lossening and fracture.",Immunology
7360519,"Sequential effects of acute meconium obstruction on pulmonary function. The relationship between pulmonary function and the migration of meconium to distal airways was determined in 10 rabbits (mean weight 2.6 kg) after insufflation of a meconium-saline mixture (1--2 ml/kg). Animals were anesthetized, cannulated, intubated, and mechanically ventilated with 100% oxygen. Lung mechanical dysfunction was most severe during the early phase of meconium migration, 15 min postinsufflation. Substantial increases in inspiratory lung resistance (RI) and expiratory lung resistance (RE) suggest that the site of obstruction at 15 min was the large airways. A decrease in dynamic lung compliance with unchanged static compliance characterizes the obstruction as partial. At 15 min and throughout the migration process, RE was greater than RI, demonstrating a check-valve effect. This phenomenon was substantiated by an increased functional residual capacity (FRC) in all rabbits, presumably due to gas trapping. Secondary to these changes, marked hypoxemia, hypercapnea, and acidosis developed in spite of assisted ventilation with 100% oxygen. At 60 and 120 min postinsufflation, both RI and RE decreased as compared to 15 min. This suggests that the predominant site of obstruction shifted to medium and small airways concomitant with the migration of meconium. Widespread and uneven distribution of meconium still produced significant frequency dependence of lung compliance. Static compliance remained unchanged, indicating that meconium does not affect surface-active or tissue properties of the lung within 120 min postinsufflation. These data suggest that effective respiratory management after meconium aspiration is dependent on the degree of meconium migration, as reflected by pulmonary mechanics.",Immunology

With high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), lymphocytes from six human donors were evaluated for their ability to metabolize benzo(a)pyrene (BP). Donors whose aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) inducibility ratios ranged from 2.4 to 4.6 and whose antipyrine plasma half-lives ranged from 8 to 17 hr were examined. The BP metabolites identified were: 7,8-dihydrodiol, quinones, and 9-hydroxy and 3-hydroxy phenols. HPLC profiles of BP metabolites elaborated by uninduced (control) and benz(a)anthracene-induced lymphocytes were qualitatively similar among the six donors. A good correlation (r = 0.79) was found between known AHH inducibility ratios for the donors, as determined by the conventional fluorometric AHH assay, and induction of BP phenol production quantitated from HPLC data. HPLC results also indicated that the induction of benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol, the proposed proximate carcinogenic form of BP, did not parallel BP phenol induction. Furthermore, the data also indicated a good negative correlation between AHH inducibility and the measurements of plasma antipyrine or urinary 4-hydroxyantipyrine half-lives (r = -0.88 or -0.91), respectively.",Immunology

The value of ultrasonic and hormonal methods [plasma human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), estradiol (E2), and progesterone (P)] was examined in 188 patients exhibiting different forms of early pregnancy failure. A negative ultrasonic result in the detection of fetal life signs after 9 weeks' gestation signified an unsuccessful outcome for the pregnancy in 100% of cases. On the other hand, the ultrasonic demonstration of fetal life predicted delivery in 90% of cases despite symptoms of threatened abortion. Pathologic levels of hCG or P signified a later miscarriage in 93% of cases, and their combination correlated with a 100% failure rate. In the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy the combined application of ultrasound and plasma hCG levels seemed to be very useful; however it appears that the detection of blighted ovum should be based on the ultrasonic scanning only. The results of the present study indicate that ultrasonic examination can be regarded as the basic diagnostic method in the evaluation of early pregnancy failure. The determination of plasma trophoblastic hormones (especially hCG) seems to add valuable information to the ultrasonic findings in the actual diagnosis and evaluation of the later course of pregnancy only until 9 weeks' gestation.",Immunology

Acentric chromosome fragments produced in cells by irradiation or other agents give rise to micronuclei in daughter cells. The micronuclei can be counted readily in large numbers of cells which provides a sensitive measure of chromosome aberrations. Previous studies have shown that the presence of contrast material enhances the radiation-induced yield of micronuclei in vitro. This may be due to the dose enhancement effect and the chemical action of contrast media or their derivatives. Micronuclei were scored in peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from 26 patients before and after excretory urography (ExU). The results show a consistent and significant increase in the counts after ExU amounting to about one third of the counts blood samples before the examination. We have also measured radiation exposures in this group and estimated an average exposure to the circulating lymphocytes of about 0.2R (0.52 X 10(-4) C/kg). We conclude that the contrast medium contributed significantly to the increase in micronuclei.,Immunology

The ration either was unmedicated or contained .0125% amprolium, .0125% clopidol, or .0110% monensin. The relationship between the feeding schedule and coccidial infection was determined on the basis of 1) efficacy of the medication in controlling a single infection in susceptible pullets and 2) the development of immunity to subsequent challenge inoculation after a series of immunizing inoculations. Cage-reared, susceptible pullets were inoculated with sporulated oocysts of either. Eimeria tenella, 2 strains of E. acervulina, or E. maxima. With all three medications, the infection with a least one species was more severe, as measured by intestinal lesion score, in the RF pullets than in the corresponding AL pullets. Other pullets were kept for three weeks in floor pens that contained coccidial oocysts to allow natural infection and immunity to develop. The pullets were then transferred to suspended cages to prevent reinfection and fed an unmedicated ration. After one week, the pullets were challenged with the same coccidial strain as that used for immunizing. All pullets initially exposed to coccidia and given no medication were resistant to challenge inoculation. Control pullets are exposed to coccidia during rearing were susceptible to challenge.

The only polypeptides other than F1 and F2 which fell below the diagonal, indicating the positions of the polypeptides from infected cells, were two minor glycoproteins designated HN1 (51.5K) and HN2 (27.5K) which took up positions vertically beneath the major haemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoprotein HN (75K). Dual isotope labelling experiments with NDV-infected chick embryo fibroblasts, which had previously received a salt shock to effect synchronization of polypeptide initiation upon release of salt shock, revealed the following orientations within the parent molecules: NH2-F2-F1-COOH and NH2-HN1-HN2-COOH. The existence of intermolecular disulphide bonds, orientation and relative lengths of the two NDV HN fragments is analogous to the HA1 and HA2 proteins of influenza virus haemagglutinin.",Immunology
7365386,"Dose and time responses models for the incidence of bladder and liver neoplasms in mice fed 2-acetylaminofluorene continuously. The incidence of bladder and liver neoplasms developed in mice continuously fed 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) in a multidisciplined study conducted at the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) is represented using a probit model. The estimated incidences are made from time intervals using both sacrificed and dead and moribund mice. A probit log dose model is fit for each type of neoplasm at each time interval where the incidence permits. A probit log time model is fit for each of the neoplastic types for each dose level where the incidence permits. Finally, the response of liver neoplasms to 2-AAF is represented in the dose time plane using a probit plane model. 2-AAF appears to be an early acting bladder carcinogen and a late acting liver carcinogen. The bladders seem to be much more uniform in their response to the carcinogen than the livers and the uniformity of neither response appears to be age dependent. Although the time to appearence of both liver and bladder neoplasms is dose related, the increment in incidence of liver neoplasms with respect to time is not dose related while that of the bladder neoplasms is dose related. The data for bladder neoplasms do not contradict the ""no threshold"" theory of carcinogenesis while the liver data strongly support it.",Immunology

7350935,"Interaction of high molecular weight kininogen, factor XII, and fibrinogen in plasma at interfaces. Using ellipsometry, anodized tantalum interference color, and Coomassie blue staining in conjunction with immunologic identification of proteins adsorbed at interfaces, we have previously found that fibrinogen is the main constituent deposited by plasma onto many man-made surfaces. However, the fibrinogen deposited from normal plasma onto glass and similar wettable materials is rapidly modified during contact activation until it can no longer be identified antigenically. In earlier publications, we have called this modification of the fibrinogen layer ""conversion,"" to indicate a process of unknown nature. Conversion of adsorbed fibrinogen by the plasma was not accompanied by marked change in film thickness, so that we presumed that this fibrinogen was not covered but replaced by other protein. Conversion is now showen to be markedly delayed in plasma lacking high molecular weight kininogen, slightly delayed in plasma lacking factor XII, and normal in plasma that lack factor XI or prekallikrein. We conclude that intact plasma will quickly replace the fibrinogen it has deposited on glass-like surfaces by high molecular weight kininogen and, to a smaller extent, by factor XII. Platelets adhere preferentially to fibrinogen-coated surfaces; human platelets adhere to hydrophobic nonactivating surfaces, since on these, adsorbed firbinogen is not exchanged by the plasma. The adsorbed fibrinogen will be replaced on glass-like surfaces during surface activation of clotting, and platelets failing to find fibrinogen will not adhere.",Immunology

Seasonal changes in testicular and accessory gland weights, histological testicular structures, fructose and citric acid concentrations in two accessory glands and plasma testosterone levels were determined in adult male hedgehogs living in middle western France. Testicular activity started in winter (from December to February) during the last part of the hibernation period. During this resumption period, testis weights as well as all the testicular structural features (Leydig cell volume; length, diameter and volume of seminiterous tubules) increased. These changes were correlated with similar variations in plasma testosterone concentrations and accessory gland features (weight, fructose and citric acid contents). However, maximal development of endocrine testicular function was reached about one month before the completion of spermatogenesis and the maximal development of androgen target organs. Testicular activity was high from February-March to August-September, according to the year. After the spring peak corresponding to the main breeding period, a decrease in testicular activity was always noted in May-June. The values of the testicular features then remained high or increased again and a second breeding period always occurred. Finally, involution began at the end of summer but the endocrine function of the testis decreased before the exocrine function. All the gonadal functions were depressed from September to November. Our results show that in middle western France, one of the southern-most countries characterized by a mild, temperate climate, the testis of Erinaceus europaeus L. is activated earlier and the breeding season lasts longer than in any of the other European countries cited in the literature.",Immunology

The aim of this paper is to demonstrate, with the aid of reliable numerical methods, the incidence of the variable, lack of mothering care, in an experimental group (GE) of 94 children under three years of age who had suffered, at least once, separation from mother and had lived for a while in a institution for young children. GE was compared with a control group (GC) of 79 children of similar age and socio-economic status who had never suffered separation from mother. The present paper was based on field research carried out by Julia Ferrari de Prieto in the Refugio Maternal (RM), an institution for young children located in a pediatric hospital in Buenos Aires. From the data gathered, comprising specimen observation, interviews, and results of Brunet and Lezine's Development Test for young children, the AA selected quantitative information--quotient of development (CD)--to make a computational program that proved the following: a) that GC, with a mean CD of 101.61 was really a random sample from a population of children under three years old who had received non-interrupted mothering care; b) that in all the experimental group (GET) the weight of the variable lack of mothering care was found to be very strong, and represented a development shortfall of about 20%; c) that the GET was really a non-homogeneous sample from which was set apart a small sub-group called experimental segregated group (GES) characterized by the short span spent in the RM and whose mean CD of 97.11 was comparatively high; d) that, however, GES was different from GC (Chi-squared test proved the non-dependency of GES and GC samples with a level of significance of 0.05); e) that, therefore, the variable, time when mothering care was lacking was one of very strong weight, even if the period spent in RM was a very short one (7 days for children of age over three months, and 30 days for children of age under three months, at the time of their arrival at the RM).

7348050,"[Structure of a delusion. II. The distortion stage]. When one considers a text which deviates from the ordinary and logic rules of language and is pervaded by imagination, the intent of reasoning over its content impedes the adequate comprehension of the various significations born by the mentioned text. This difficulty of reasoning is due to the coexistence of significations incompatible among them. If we also take account the historic lag, the argumentation and the underestimation of the others by the author (they are only the 'redundant ones'), it becomes evident that we are to reconstruct a situation which is dangerously fragile. There is an added obstacle, the fact that the text has a significance in three levels - historic, fantastic and delusional-in which each message is decodified. The family, culture and belief contexts are the necessary material resources. The text becomes in this way, conventional, increasing its semantic credibility. The delusion, in spite of its appearing as a creation, is not more than a redundancy with which the author seeks a conciliation between incompatible ideas. Its significance changes, then, constantly and instead of informing, blocks its comprehension and frustrates the reader. To succeed in the recreation of a world in which the conditions mentioned be accomplished, it is necessary to persuade. That's way it is necessary for the author to legitimate the imaginary fillings of the text. The intent of symbolizing turns the deviation into distortion, second structural moment of delusion whose principal purpose is at the service of the new identity. The text is arranged as an inventio rethorica by means of the enthymem, procedure by which it becomes linked to the already mentioned semantic credibility. In this way the estimation of the other changes. They are taken into account according to their capacity of sending back what the deluded person wants to hear. The distortion is not limited to the text; it also reaches the appreciation of the others. All this ends in a complex rethoric development in which digressions, the slide of significations, and the anaphoras (repetions) abund. This repetition sends back to 'something-already-known', impossible of being symbolically expressed, but which constitutes the reference always present. We are again before an imaginary filling of the 'hole' of the text, where the delusional synecdoche places a part instead of the whole. A text construed in this way is never convincent nor conveys certitude. The delusional text needs to keep attached to the opinion of others.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the rate of urinary potassium excretion is markedly greater in animals fed a high potassium diet than in animals on a control diet before and during the acute infusion of potassium salts. Because the contribution of the medullary collecting duct to urinary potassium under these conditions has not been determined, microcatheterization studies were performed to elucidate the role of that nephron segment in regulating potassium excretion in controls and in animals on a potassium-enriched diet. Although there was no evidence of net transport of potassium by the medullary collecting duct in control animals under basal conditions, net secretion of potassium by that nephron segment accounted for nearly one half of the increased rate of urinary excretion in animals fed a high potassium diet. During acute infusion of potassium salts, potassium secretion by the medullary portion of the collecting duct contributed approximately one half of the potassium in the final urine samples in both controls and animals fed a high potassium diet. Because the rate of urinary excretion was twofold greater in experimental animals during acute potassium loading, absolute potassium secretion in medullary collecting duct was twice the control rate in animals adapted to a high potassium dietary intake. These data demonstrate, therefore, that the medullary collecting duct plays an important role in regulating the excretion of potassium when the excretory load is either acutely or chronically increased.",Immunology

Human protoporphyria with atypical features suggesting increased hepatic protoporphyrin synthesis was investigated in 2 patients. Analysis of the distribution of protoporphyrin among circulating erythrocytes of increasing age indicated that the erythrocyte porphyrin burden derived predominantly from erythroid sources in case 1, and from hepatic sources in case 2. Intravenous hematin was administered to both patients to assess any negative feedback effect on protoporphyrin synthesis. Erythrocyte, fecal and plasma porphyrin levels were measured serially during basal, treatment, and follow-up periods. In case 1, a significant (P less than 0.001) drop in both fecal and plasma levels accompanied hematin, while erythrocyte levels remained unchanged. Hematin produced no appreciable changes in porphyrin concentrations in case 2. Allergic vasculitis followed hematin use in both cases.

7379644,"The basis of chromatin fiber assembly within chromosomes studied by histone-DNA crosslinking followed by trypsin digestion. To determine the structural basis of chromatin assembly that leads to chromosome formation in mitosis, crosslinks were introduced by formaldehyde between contiguous components within chromosomes. Crosslinked stable products were then observed by electronmicroscopy after non-crosslinked portions were briefly digested by trypsin to unfold chromosomes.--When the DNA-histone crosslink was the primary product, trypsin readily unfolded the whole chromosome structure while preserving the 250 A unit chromatin fiber intact; only a single unit fiber was tracked within the centromere region connecting the arms of each chromatid. When a histone polymer was formed by a prolonged formaldehyde crosslinking, trypsin digestion gave rise to chromatin fibers interacting with others at certain distances, and the typical chromosome structure remained unchanged. Regardless of the degree of crosslinking, there were neither thick supercoiled unit fibers nor proteinaceous cores.--These results suggest that the fiber connection may represent, to some extent, the interacting sites of folded chromatin fibers in situ within chromosomes, and also that the 250 A unit fibers are the sole, highest structural basis in chromosomes. Since virtually no appreciable histone digestion took place in the crosslinked chromosomes, the observation that even after DNA-histone crosslinking the fiber interacting sites were accessible to trypsin preferentially over other portions, may be consistent with our recent results that the exposed, lysine-rich tails of histones represent such interacting sites.",Immunology

Antigenic sites were detected by an indirect unlabeled antibody complexed to horseradish peroxidase.

The degradation of protein was studied under conditions of basal proteolysis in the presence of 10% pig serum. After a lag of about 6 h a time- and dose-dependent inhibition of protein degradation was observed, up to a maximum of about 40%. 2. The inhibitor entered the cells with kinetics consistent with entry by pinocytosis, giving access to the lysosomal system. 3. Intracellular cathepsin B was almost completely inactivated after 90 min of exposure of the culture to 0.1 mm-inhibitor. 4. The inhibition of proteolysis and of cathepsin B was reversed virtually completely within 24 h, when the inhibitor was removed from the medium. Since the inhibitor forms a covalent bond with the enzyme, the recovery of cathepsin B activity presumably reflects production of new molecules of active enzyme. 5. The inhibitory effects of pepstatin, the carboxyl proteinase inhibitor, were under some circumstances additive with those Z-Phe-Ala-CHN2, and were also largely reversible. 6.

The results obtained demonstrated that placental cells may fix large quantities of maternal immunoglobulins.

Capillary Hb concentration on the first day of life was registered in 201 infants with weight appropriate for gestational age (AGA) and in 99 infants small for gestational age (SGA). In both groups Hb increased towards term (P less than 0.01), while the SGA infants reached higher Hb concentration at term (21.5 +/- 1.9 g/dl; mean +/- SD) than the AGA infants (17.9 +/- 1.5 g/dl) (P less than 0.001). The cord serum erythropoietin (EP) level increased towards term equally in both groups. Delivery did not seem to influence the EP level as same values were obtained in cord serum from infants delivered by elective cesarean section as after uncomplicated vaginal delivery. No correlation was found between cord serum EP and first day capillary PCV. Postnatally a rapid fall in the EP level occurred. In healthy adults no serum EP activity was detected. It is suggested that increasing hypoxia, rapid growth, and shift from hepatic to myeloid erythropoiesis may be related to the increasing Hb concentration and serum EP level towards term. Improvement of oxygenation during air breathing may cause the decreasing serum EP level after birth.",Immunology

Cartilage cells are characterized by a high concentration of extracellular sulfated proteoglycan. Electron microscopic autoradiography was used to compare the incorporation of sulfate into proteoglycan by limb-bud chondrogenic and myogenic cells. From stage 19 to stage 21 there was no significant difference between the cartilage- and muscle-forming regions in the number of silver grains over either the extracellular space or the intracellular space. From stage 22 to 25 the number of extracellular silver grains was significantly greater in the chondrogenic region than in the myogenic region, but the number of intracellular silver grains was the same. Since most of the silver grains were intracellular, no significant difference in the total number of grains was found between the two tissues. Stage-26 and -27 embryos showed a significantly greater number of silver grains over both the cells and the extracellular space in the cartilage region than in the muscle region. Thus, the first step of cartilage differentiation involves a decrease in the extracellular deposition of sulfated proteoglycan in the myogenic region rather than an increase in deposition in the chondrogenic region between stage 22 and 25. After stage 25 there is an increase in sulfated proteoglycan synthesis in the chondrogenic region to the myogenic region.",Immunology

Diflunisal protein binding was studied by equilibrium dialysis at 37 degrees in plasma from healthy, uremic, and geriatric subjects. Binding data were computer analyzed assuming 2 classes of independent binding sites (Scatchard model). K1, the primary association constant for the diflunisal-albumin interaction, was substantially lower in uremic plasma (2.39 +/- 0.29 x 10(5) M-1) than in normal plasma (6.86 +/- 0.59 x 10(5) M-1). No difference was found between the number of primary diflunisal binding sites (N1) in uremic and normal plasma. In geriatric plasma neither K1 nor N1 differed from the normal values, indicating that decreased diflunisal plasma protein binding in the elderly is a result of lower plasma albumin concentration. Binding studies with plasma from uremic patients during hemodialysis revealed that free diflunisal rose from 0.46 +/- 0.04% at the start to 0.61 +/- 0.06% at the end of dialysis. Plasma free fatty acid concentrations rose similarly. In vitro displacement studies showed that oleic acid is a competitive inhibitor for the binding of diflunisal to human serum albumin.

Studies on the stereochemistry of 24,28-epoxy-24-ethylcholesterol, a key intermediate in sitosterol to cholesterol conversion in insects, were undertaken. In nutritional experiments, the 24R,28S and 24S,28R stereoisomers (isofucosterol epoxides) were unable to support growth and development of silkworm larvae. Incubation of 3 alpha-3H-labeled (24R,28R)- and (24S,28S)-epoxide (fucosterol epoxides) with a cell-free preparation from silkworm guts resulted in effective conversion into desmosterol and cholesterol; (24R,28R)-epoxide was the slightly better substrate. Fucosterol incubation yielded (24R,28R)-epoxide and the 24S,28S isomer in approximately equal amounts, while slightly preferential formation of the 24R,28R isomer was observed in in vivo experiments. These results indicate that both the formation of the epoxide from fucosterol and its conversion to desmosterol proceed with a low degree of stereospecificity.",Immunology

Glycine uptake by newborn rat renal cortical slices in the presence of 2 mM diamide remained unchanged from control value during incubation times up to 30 minutes. Longer exposure to diamide resulted in decreased net uptake. Kinetic analysis of this phenomenon indicated a noncompetitive inhibitory effect of diamide upon the low-affinity glycine uptake system, whereas glycine uptake on the high-affinity system was obliterated. A similar analysis of the diamide effects on adult tissue indicated a noncompetitive inhibition of both the low- and high-affinity glycine transport systems. Diamide did not cause any demonstrable change in glycine efflux from newborn cortical slices. Thus the decreased net uptake we observed in newborn slices in the presence of diamide could be explained solely on the basis of an effect on glycine entry. Simultaneous measurements of intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels in the newborn tissue showed a lack of any direct relationship between the transport effects of diamide and its oxidative effect on reduced glutathione.",Immunology

It has been suggested that blood viscosity is involved in the control of cerebral blood flow (CBF) (Thomas et al. 1977a, b, Humphrey et al. 1979). CBF, using the intravenous Xenon133 technique, blood viscosity and haematocrit were measured in 21 patients with elevated viscosity due to paraproteinaemia and found to be the same as in normal subjects. However, the paraproteinaemic patients were anaemic with a mean haematocrit of 0.342. This degree of anaemia would normally be associated with a high CBF. The paraproteinaemic patients were then compared with a group of 10 anaemic patients with matched haematocrits but without paraprotein bands. The whole blood and plasma viscosities were significantly higher in the paraproteinaemic patients and the CBF was significantly lower. The haematocrit, and therefore oxygen carriage, was similar in the two groups. It is likely that in the anaemia of paraproteinaemia the expected increase in CBF did not occur because of the limiting factor of increased viscosity. This suggests that in this instance viscosity rather than oxygen carriage is a major determinant in the control of CBF. This is further emphasized by the better correlation between CBF and blood viscosity than between CBF and haematocrit. It seems likely that viscosity and oxygen carriage are independent variables in the control of CBF.",Immunology

Studies of time estimation among schizophrenics have sometimes been difficult to integrate with one another because of differing methodologies and inconsistent definitions. The present study should increase clarity by employing several methods of time estimation within the same study and maintaining a consistent definition of overestimation and underestimation across tasks. 26 schizophrenic and 26 control subjects were given three types of time-estimation tasks. Longer interval Estimation involved judging, at different points in the interview/testing session, how much time had passed. Verbal Estimation required subjects to judge the length of brief intervals signalled by the examiner. Operative Estimation required subjects to indicate when a specified number of seconds had passed. Schizophrenic subjects were significantly more inaccurate than controls in the Verbal and Operative Estimation tasks. Moreover, with overestimation defined consistently as judging more time to have passed than actually has, both Verbal and Operative Estimation results indicated schizophrenics were significantly more likely to overestimate. These results indicate support for the suggestion that schizophrenics have a disturbed sense of time, with real (clock) time experienced as passing more slowly than is actually the case. Long Interval Estimation produced quite different results, but it was felt that the retrospective and unfocused nature of the time judgments in this task made it a less valid indicator of ability to estimate.",Immunology

Erythropoietin (Ep) is a glycoprotein hormone that is responsible for mammalian red blood cell production. Adult rat liver regenerating 48-72 h after hepatectomy (hepx) produces elevated levels of Ep in response to hypoxia when compared to sham-operated, anephric hypoxic controls. A factor, termed hepatopoietin (Hp), found in the serum of hepx rats, is capable of stimulating hepatic Ep production when administered to normal rats 18 h prior to hypoxic exposure. Although the hepatic vein is the most potent source of this factor, Hp can also be demonstrated in the systemic arterial circulation. Bilateral nephrectomy (nephrx) of the donor hepx animal 24 h prior to bleeding abolishes this variation, and highest Ep levels are noted when serum from a hepx and nephrx rat is administered to animals immediatley after nephrx and 18 h before hypoxic exposure. Serum derived from hepx male rats displays a greater ability to evoke hepatic Ep production in normal recipients than serum from similarly treated female rats. Regardless of the sex of the hepx donor, Ep elaboration after hypoxia is highest in male recipients. The results indicate that there is a sexual variation in the production of Hp as well as Ep.",Immunology

Analysis of hormone binding by heme and globin moieties showed T3 binding to be limited to the heme fraction. Addition of excess unlabeled T3 to hemoglobin or heme incubated with labeled T3 indicated 75% to 90% of hormone binding was poorly dissociable. These observations suggested that the presence of hemoglobin in RBC lysate or in serum could influence the measurement of T4 and T3 by specific RIA. Subsequent studies of the addition to serum of human hemoglobin revealed a significant reduction in T3 and T4 detectable by RIA in the presence of this protein. The effect was influenced by the concentration of hemoglobin and by duration and temperature of incubations of hemoglobin and serum prior to RIA. Incubated for 5 days at 4 degrees C, 14 sera containing 10 gm/dl hemoglobin showed a mean decrease in T3 concentration of 40% compared to sera incubated in the absence of hemoglobin (160.1 to 93.9 ng/dl, p less than 0.001); detectable serum T4 fell by 50% in 13 sera incubated under the same conditions (5.40 micrograms/dl without hemoglobin to 2.55 micrograms/dl in the presence of hemoglobin, p less than 0.001). Hemoglobin concentrations in serum as low as 0.1 and 0.5 gm/dl affected the RIAs significantly. Thus a major fraction of thyroid hormone binding in human RBC cytoplasm is accounted for by an interaction with hemoglobin. This interaction in serum or RBC lysates is a significant variable affecting iodothyronine determinations.",Immunology

The highest of 6-phosphogluconate was seen in brains of 3-day-old rats when it was at that age more than six times the adult level. Turnover rates for this same compound were determined by an in vitro technique at ages 1, 3 and 12 days and in the adult.

The total volumes and relative quantities of grey and white matter have been measured in sixty-five normal male and sixty-five normal female cerebral hemispheres. Fixed hemisphere volume was found to fall linearly at 3.5% per decade for men from 641 ml at the age of 20 to 463 ml at the age of 100. For women the decrease was 1.9% per decade from 531 ml at 20 years to 462 ml at 100 years. After correction for the effects of fixation and for the secular increase in brain size, it was concluded that mean hemisphere volume remained roughly constant between the ages of 20 and 50 years (558 ml for men, 474 ml for women). After the age of 50 the mean volume in both sexes fell at about 2% per decade. The ratio of the volumes of grey to white matter was the same for the two sexes at all ages. Its mean value was 1.3 at the age of 20, falling to 1.1 at the age of 50, then rising steadily to over 1.5 at 100 years.

7373715,"Genetic variation during persistent reovirus infection: presence of extragenically suppressed temperature-sensitive lesions in wild-type virus isolated from persistently infected L cells. Persistent reovirus infection of L cells was established with a serially passaged stock of temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant C(447) containing greater than 90% defective interfering particles. Within a month after establishment of the carrier culture, the ts mutant was replaced by virus that expressed the wild-type (ts(+)) temperature phenotype (R. Ahmed and A. F. Graham, J. Virol. 23:250-262, 1977). To determine whether the ts(+) phenotype of the virus was due to intragenic reversion or to the presence of an extragenic mutation suppressing the original ts defect, several clones were backcrossed to wild-type reovirus, and the progeny of each cross were screened for temperature sensitivity. The results indicated that the original tsC lesion had reverted. However, in two of the seven clones examined, new ts lesions were found. These new ts lesions appeared phenotypically as ts(+) due to the presence of extragenic suppressor mutations. Temperature-sensitive mutants representing three different groups were rescued from one suppressed clone, indicating that this ts(+) clone contained multiple ts lesions. Among the ts mutants rescued were the initial isolates of a new recombination group which we have designated H. Some of the ts mutants rescued from the suppressed clones are capable of interfering with the growth of wild-type reovirus and may play a role in maintaining the carrier state. The results of this study show that persistently infected L cells contain a genetically heterogeneous population of reovirus even though all virus clones express the ts(+) phenotype. It is thus critical to distinguish between genotype and phenotype when analyzing viruses that emerge during persistent infection.",Immunology

We have identified a specific, high affinity receptor for the chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-[3H]Phe on inflammatory as well as on resident guinea pig peritoneal macrophages. The receptor on inflammatory macrophages has an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 11 nM at room temperature, and there are approximately 10,000 binding sites per cell. The receptor on resident peritoneal macrophages has a KD of 7 nM with approximately 12,000 sites per cell. The increased chemotactic responsiveness of inflammatory macrophages as compared to resident macrophages is probably not due to differences in the fMet-Leu-[3h]phe receptor since the number of binding sites per cell and the KD are quite similar. The specificity of the binding site on both cell types for a series of N-formylated peptides correlates well with the ability of the peptides to initiate macrophage chemotaxis. These studies suggest that the chemotactic response of guinea pig peritoneal macrophages to N-formylated peptides is initiated by the binding of the peptides to a specific cell-surface receptor.",Immunology

Sham-operated controls showed the usual partial reinforcement extinction effect (PREE), i.e., PR-trained animals were more resistant to extinction than CR-trained animals. The PREE was abolished by hippocampectomy, which increased resistance to extinction in CR-trained rats and decreased it in PR-trained rats.

CI 845 greater than or equal to 1 X 10(-6) M depressed both maximum upstroke velocity of phase 0 and automaticity. CI 845 greater than or equal to 1 X 10(-5) M significantly decreased action potential amplitude and duration measured at 50% repolarization and prolonged action potential duration measured at full repolarization. In addition, this concentration depressed membrane responsiveness and prolonged the effective refractory period and conduction time. All changes were reversible following superfusion with drug-free Tyrode solution. Increasing extracellular potassium ([K+]0) from 4 mM to 6 mM did not potentiate the CI 845-induced changes.

The two-compartment open model was found to characterize adequately both the single and multiple dose data. No significant differences were noted when the model-independent pharmacokinetic parameters between the two groups of patients were compared with the exception of the distribution phase half-life (t1/2 alpha) (6.70 min single vs 9.19 min multiple p less than 0.05). Mean values for the pooled data for the half-life (t1/2 beta), plasma clearance (Clp) and volume of distribution (Vd beta) were 134.58 min, 1.20 ml/min/kg and 225.28 ml/kg respectively. Evoked twitch response was monitored in each patient to assess the degree of neuromuscular blockade. In only one patient was the bolus dose sufficient to produce complete (100%) blockade, thus the degree of maximal response varied between 78 to 100% and took some 3 to 10 minutes after dose administration. The concurrently measured gallamine plasma concentrations ranged from 9.30 to 19.20 micrograms/ml.

The highly purified preparation migrated as a triplet on sodium dodecyl sulfate/urea--polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with apparent molecular weights of 93000, 88000, and 85000. The coagulant activity of the purified preparations was inhibited by antibodies raised in rabbits against either the purified factor VIII protein or a preparation of factor VIII/von Willebrand factor. Antibodies to the purified protein also inhibited the coagulant activity of factor VIII/von Willebrand factor preparations. The purified factor VIII contained no platelet-aggregating activity, as measured in human platelet-rich plasma. The purified preparation of factor VIII was required for the activation of factor X in the presence of factor IXa, calcium, and phospholipid. It was activated about 30-fold by thrombin or factor Xa plus calcium and phospholipid, and each of these reactions was accompanied by a change in the sodium dodecyl sulfate/urea--polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis pattern of the protein. Factor VIII was rapidly inactivated by bovine-activated protein C in a reaction requiring calcium and phospholipid. This reaction was also associated with a change in the sodium dodecyl sulfate/urea--polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis pattern of the highly purified protein. These experiments involving three highly specific serine proteases support the conclusion that the triplet observed on polyacrylamide gels is factor VIII.",Immunology

Polymorphonuclear leucocyte function was assessed in 13 patients with influenza by measuring phagocytosis of staphylococci and chemotaxis. Significant impairment of chemotaxis was shown. Subsequeuntly polymorph chemotaxis was found to be impaired in a group of volunteers infected with virus recombinants of A/New Jersey/8/76 but not in volunteers infected with a virus recombinant of A/Victoria/3/75. These results accord well with the in vitro effects of certain influenza viruses on polymorph function and suggest that interference with polymorph function may predispose to bacterial pneumonia after clinical influenza.,Immunology

7356725,"Membrane attack complex of complement: a structural analysis of its assembly. This study was conducted to gain insight into the process of assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC) of complement through structural analysis. Four intermediate complexes and the MAC were examined by electron microscopy and by sucrose density-gradient ultracentrifugation. The C5b-6 complex has a sedimentation rate of 11S, an elongated, slightly curved shape and dimensions of 160 x 60 x 60 A. At protein concentrattions greater than 1 mg/ml, and physiologic ionic strength and pH, the complex forms paracrystals that have the appearance of parallel strands. Equimolar quantities of C5b-6 and C7 mixed in the absence of lipids or detergents give rise to C5b-7 protein micelles which are soluble in aqueous media and have a sedimentation rate of 36S, suggesting a tetrameric composition. Ultrastructurally, C5b-7 protein micelles consist of four half-rings, each measuring 200 x 50 A, which are connected to one another by short stalks extending from the convex side of the half-rings. C5b-7 bound to dioleoyl lecithin (DOL) vesicles has a similar ultrastructural appearance. After extraction with deoxycholate (DOC), C5b-7 has a sedimentation velocity of 36S which further suggests the occurrence of C5b-7 in the form of tetrameric protein micelles. Attachment of C8 to vesicle-bound C5b-7 results in dissociation of the protein micelles. An individual C5b-8 complex appears as a half-ring attached to the DOL-vesicle via a 100-A-long and 30-A-wide stalk. After extraction from the DOL-vesicles with DOC, C5b-8 has a sedimentation velocity of approximately 18S. Binding of C9 to DOL-vesicle bound C5b-8 induces the formation of the typical ultrastructural complement lesions. C5b-9 extracted from the vesicles with DOC has a sedimentation rate of 33S, which is characteristic of the C5b-9 dimer. It is concluded that dimerization is a function of C9. C5b-9 monomers are visualized when a single C5b-9 complex or an odd number of complexes were bound per DOL-vesicle. The C5b-9 monomer has an ultrastructural appearance that is theoretically expected of a half-dimer: a 200- x 50-A half-ring which is attached to the DOL-vesicle by a 100- x 80-A appendage. Extracted with DOC, the C5b-9 monomer has a sedimentation rate of 23S. At a higher multiplicity of MAC per DOL-vesicle, large structural defects in the lipid bilayer are seen which are attributed to direct physical destruction of membranes by the known lipid-binding capacity of the MAC. It is proposed that protein micelle formation at the C5b-7 stage of MAC assembly and dissociation of these micelles upon binding of C8 are events that facilitate dimerization of C5b-9 and thus MAC formation.",Immunology

7356684,"Urinary kallikrein excretion in essential and mineralocorticoid hypertension. Urinary kallikrein excretion has been reported to be decreased in patients with essential hypertension and elevated in patients with primary aldosteronism as a reflection of mineralocorticoid activity. Low renin essential hypertension (LREH) has been postulated to result from excess production of an unknown mineralocorticoid(s). Urinary kallikrein excretion was compared in outpatients with essential hypertension, mineralocorticoid hypertension (primary aldosteronism and 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency), and in normal subjects of the same race. No significant difference in urinary kallikrein excretion of patients with LREH vs. normal renin essential hypertension (NREH) was found for either black (4.1+/-0.4 vs. 4.8+/-0.5 esterase units (EU)/24 h, mean+/-SE, for 27 LREH and 38 NREH, respectively) or white patients (12.2+/-2.3 vs. 11.7+/-1.4 EU/24 h for 13 LREH and 25 NREH, respectively). Urinary kallikrein was decreased in black vs. white hypertensive patients and normal subjects. However, in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance >/=80 ml/min) urinary kallikrein was not significantly decreased in either black hypertensive vs. black normal subjects (4.3+/-0.3 vs. 5.4+/-0.6 EU/24 h) or in white hypertensive vs. white normal subjects (11.9+/-1.2 vs. 8.4+/-0.9 EU/24 h). In contrast, hypertensive patients with mild renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance of 41.8+/-78.5 ml/min) had reduced (P < 0.05) urinary kallikrein (3.3 EU/24 h with creatinine clearance of 63.6+/-2.0 for 24 black patients and 4.2+/-0.7 EU/24 h with creatinine clearance of 67.0+/-3.5 for 6 white patients). These results suggest that a reduction in urinary kallikrein excretion rate is an early accompaniment of hypertensive renal injury. Urinary kallikrein excretion in response to a 6-d 10-meq sodium diet and a 3-d Florinef (0.5 mg b.i.d.) administration was compared in hypertensive patients with normal renal function vs. race and age-matched normal subjects. Stimulation of urinary kallikrein excretion by Florinef was equal in black and white normal subjects vs. hypertensive patients (black normals = 12.3+/-2.7 [n = 9], NREH = 11.7+/-1.8 [n = 10], LREH = 10.9+/-1.5 [n = 12]; white normals = 21.2+/-2.9 [n = 11], essential hypertension = 20.9+/-3.2 [10 NREH, 5 LREH]). Stimulation of urinary kallikrein excretion with low sodium diet was decreased (P < 0.05) only in black LREH (black normals = 11.2+/-2.4 [n = 10], NREH = 10.1+/-2.7 [n = 10], LREH = 7.4+/-1.1 [n = 13]; white normals = 19.1+/-2.7 [n = 13], essential hypertension = 17.5+/-2.3 [nine NREH, four LREH]). However, during low sodium diet, black patients with LREH had evidence for less sodium depletion as manifested by a decreased rise in urinary aldosterone excretion (16.3+/-2.7 vs. 33.3+/-6.4 mug/24 h for black normals) and a failure to achieve metabolic balance in 11/13 patients. Thus, the lesser kallikrein stimulation appeared to result from these two factors. Black and white hypertensives with creatinine clearance <80 ml/min had little increase in urinary kallikrein excretion with Florinef or low sodium diet.5 of 12 patients with primary aldosteronism or 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency did not have an elevated urinary kallikrein excretion rate. Mild renal insufficiency may have contributed to this finding in two of these five patients. Nevertheless, this finding illustrates a limitation to the use of urinary kallikrein excretion rate as an index of mineralocorticoid activity. However, it appears that the majority of patients with LREH have no evidence for excess production of an unknown mineralocorticoid. The failure to find a decrease in urinary kallikrein excretion in racially matched patients with essentil hypertension and normal renal function questions the postulate of a role of the kallikrein-kinin system in the initiation of essential hypertension.",Immunology
7356682,"Characterization of deficient heme synthase activity in protoporphyria with cultured skin fibroblasts. Heme synthase (ferrochelatase) activity, as determined by the chelation of ferrous iron to protoporphyrin or deuteroporphyrin, is reduced to 10-25% of normal in tissues of patients with protoporphyria. With cultured skin fibroblasts from seven patients with protoporphyria and six normal individuals, the present studies examined the enzymatic defect.Heme synthase activity in normal and protoporphyria fibroblasts had the same pH optimum, showed similar inhibition by divalent metals, and had the highest specific activity in the mitochondrial-enriched fraction. The ultrastructural features and other biochemical parameters of mitochondria were normal in protoporphyria cells, excluding a general mitochondrial defect. Measurement of the rate of deuteroheme formation at different concentrations of substrate demonstrated a significant reduction in the apparent K(m) for deuteroporphyrin in detergent-treated sonicates of protoporphyria fibroblasts compared to normal (7.5 +/- 0.9 muM, mean +/- SEM, vs. 17.4 +/- 1.8), as well as a decrease in the velocity of reaction (mean level was 21% of normal). Studies with intact cells, in which heme synthase activity was estimated indirectly, also indicated that the apparent K(m) for porphyrin substrate was significantly lower in protoporphyria lines. These data show that heme synthase in protoporphyria fibroblasts has markedly reduced catalytic activity despite an increased affinity for porphyrin substrate. This could be caused by either a change in the enzyme protein, or an alteration of its micro-environment.",Immunology
7356662,"Dipolar relaxation in proteins on the nanosecond timescale observed by wavelength-resolved phase fluorometry of tryptophan fluorescence. We used phase fluorometry to investigate the wavelength dependence of the fluorescence lifetimes of N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide (NATA) in solvents of varying viscosity and the lifetimes of tryptophan in human serum albumin, melittin, and liver alcohol dehydrogenase. In highly fluid solvents, and in completely vitrified solvents, the lifetime of NATA was constant across its emission spectrum. In viscous solvents, such as propylene glycol at -9 degrees C, the lifetimes of NATA increased across its emission spectrum, with the values being 3.3, 5.5, and 8.1 ns at 317, 344, and 400 nm, respectively. These wavelength-dependent lifetimes appear to be a result of reorientations of solvent dipoles around the excited state dipole moment of the indole moiety. For the three proteins investigated, the fluorescence lifetimes of tryptophan increased with increasing wavelength in a manner comparable to that observed for NATA in propylene glycol. These observations indicate that these protein matrices can reorientation around their tryptophan residues on the nanosecond timescale, and illustrate the potential of phase fluorometry for quantifying the details of these dipolar relaxation processes.",Immunology
7356660,"The heparin binding site of antithrombin III. Evidence for a critical tryptophan residue. Chemical modification of antithrombin III, the major plasma protease inhibitor, with the tryptophan reagent dimethy(2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl) sulfonium bromide, results in the incorporation of one hydroxynitrobenzyl moiety per molecule of antithrombin III. The derivatized inhibitor does not exhibit the heparin-promoted enhancement in rate of thrombin inactivation which is characteristic of the native molecule. However, the rates of thrombin inactivation in the absence of heparin are identical with native and derivatized inhibitors, indicating that the site of protease . inhibitor complex formation is not altered. Unlike native antithrombin III, the modified inhibitor does not bind to a heparin-agarose affinity column. When the modification reaction was performed with added heparin, the extent of modification was decreased and the heparin-promoted enhancement of thrombin inactivation was preserved. These results indicate that the integrity of a specific tryptophan residue is critical to the binding of heparin to antithrombin III.",Immunology

Two glycoprotein fractions from U. maydis with this nucleic acid-solubilizing activity were isolated in our laboratory using improved purification procedures. The activity was not due to nuclease contamination. The glycoproteins are distinguished by: their ability to bind to concanavalin A-Sepharose; their differential binding to double- and single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid, and to ribonucleic acid; their molecular weights (46,000 and 69,000); and the relative amounts present in growing versus nongrowing cells.

7350241,"Reassessment of the evidence for the role of secreted ADP in biphasic platelet aggregation. Mechanism of inhibition by creatine phosphate plus creatine phosphokinase. The observation that platelet secretion occurs in parallel with the second wave of platelet aggregation necessitates reassessment of the generally accepted concept that secreted ADP is the cause of second-wave aggregation. The major evidence for an involvement of secreted ADP is inhibition of second-wave aggregation by enzyme-catalyzed removal of ADP, interpreted as removal of secreted ADP. An alternative hypotheses, that the observed inhibition is due to a decrease in potentiation by extracellular ADP present prior to addition of stimulus, has been tested with the enzyme system CP plus CPK (CP/CPK). Low levels of CP/CPK inhibited gamma-thrombin-induced second-wave aggregation only after preincubation. When the second wave of gamma-thrombin- or epinephrine-induced aggregation was inhibited by very high levels of CP/CPK, the inhibition was overcome by an increase in the level of stimulus. These results are inconsistent with the idea that CP/CPK blocks second-wave aggregation by removing secreted ADP, but they are consistent with a decreased potentiation of the platelets due to a lower level of extracellular ADP prior to stimulation. Freshly prepared platelet-rich plasma contained a mean (n = 16) of 12 nM extracellular ADP. These data demonstrate that inhibition by CP/CPK cannot be taken as evidence for the involvement of secreted ADP.",Immunology

The methods utilized for this study included density ultracentrifugation, electron microscopic lipoprotein particle sizing, and disc gel electrophoresis. The data confirmed the cholesterol-lowering ability of oxandrolone and demonstrated that its effect on total serum cholesterol was limited to the low and high density lipoprotein subclasses. The drug-treated group had 50% less LDL cholesterol and 25% less HDL cholesterol. Though there was an absolute decrease in total serum cholesterol in both these fractions, there was a re-distribution of cholesterol, such that post-treatment LDL carried less cholesterol and HDL more cholesterol on a percentage basis than found in pre-treatment values.

Testosterone and progesterone titers were determined by RIA in the plasma of pregnant rats and their male and female fetuses from day 17 of gestation through the day of birth and in male and female neonates on days 3 and 5 post partum. Males had significantly higher mean testosterone levels than females from day 18 of gestation through day 5 post partum. Sex differences in plasma testosterone concentrations were greatest in the fetuses on days 18 and 19 of gestation when testosterone levels peaked in the males. Instances in which female fetuses had testosterone titers equal to or greater than their male littermates were found on every day of gestation except day 18. Mean testosterone concentrations in plasma of female fetuses were high throughout gestation (greater than 1000 pcg/ml). Testosterone concentrations decreased in both sexes after birth. Differences between the sexes remained significant, and although there was an overlap in the values for males and females, testosterone concentrations in females exceeded those of their male littermates in only one out of nine pairs of samples on day 5 and in none of seven pairs on day 3 post partum. There were no significant differences in progesterone levels in plasma of males and females, either pre- or postnatally. Progesterone titers changed as a function of days post conception in both the fetuses and their mothers. In the fetuses, progesterone levels declined progressively from day 18 post conception through the day of birth, while in the mother they rose from days 18 to 19 then declined between days 20 and 21 of pregnancy. Fetuses had lower progesterone titers than their mothers. From these data, we conclude that day 18 and possibly day 19 post conception represent a critical period during which the central nervous system of the male is primed by high levels of testosterone. Thereafter, the process of masculinization is completed by exposure to testosterone levels that are relatively low and need not be consistently higher than those of female littermates.",Immunology

Cells from atopic and non atopic individuals were cultured in the presence of either fetal calf serum, homologous serum or autologous serum. Timothy pollen antigen extract to which the atopic individuals were shown to be highly sensitive was also added in aliquot cultures. The results are as follows: Cells from atopic patients were shown to produce more IgE in vitro following contact with their corresponding serum, as compared to fetal calf serum. In those cell populations, the culture in the presence of serum from non-atopic individuals dramatically reduced the amount of newly formed IgE. To a lesser extent, the reverse could be observed, i.e. an increased amount of IgE was produced by cells from non-atopic individuals in the presence of serum from atopics.

Phencyclidine (PCP) can be detected in human hair wih commercially available radioimmunoassay regents. hair samples of all subjects admitting PCP use were positive, while thin-layer chromatographic urine analyses were positive in only one of seven cases. Presumably the drug is incorporated into the hair during  periods of drug use and then retained in that particular section of the hair for its lifetime. Earlier results in this laboratory in a more detailed study of opiate retention in hair indicated not only that nanogram levels of the drug could be measured in a single strand of hair, but also that sectional analysis of the strand could indicate the time of drug use. The PCP results again suggest that the hair sample could serve as a valuable tool in the determination of drug abuse histories.

A scanning electron microscopic (SEM) study was carried out to evaluate the endothelial changes in carotid end-to-side microsurgical anastomoses. This procedure, associated with occlusion of the brachiocephalic trunk, was performed in 24 Sprague-Dawley rats. The animals were sacrificed at time intervals ranging between 15 minutes and 14 days after surgery. The specimens were collected after perfusion-fixation in vivo and treated for SEM observations. The findings show that the first 45 minutes are the most critical time for thrombus formation. Reendothelialization could be detected at 3 days after the microsurgical procedure. Endothelial regeneration occurred earlier on the suture line than on the stitches, documented by the migration and morphological changes of the endothelial cells advancing from the normal endothelium to cover the defect and the suture material. The repair was usually completed within 14 days. Damage of the inner vascular wall, related to minor failures of the microsurgical technique, appears to be a cause of delayed reendothelialization.",Immunology

Light microscopical study of 1 micrometer thick sections of dorsal root ganglia revealed focal regions of neuronal nuclear clearing involving 40-50% of neurons at 4 days. There was subsequent progressive reduction in the incidence of such lesions. Neuronal necrosis apparently affecting less than one percent of dorsal root ganglia neurons was noted initially at 12 days in the 20 mg/kg group and 28 days in the 10 mg/kg group.

7200583,"Aversiveness of cadmium in solution. Weanling rats were given cadmium chloride solutions as drinking water (0, 25, 50 or 150 ppm Cd). Immediate decrements in fluid consumption and retarded weight gain were observed at the highest concentration. In addition, two of the 150 ppm rats died within four days. The rapid onset of these effects suggested taste aversion and sharply reduced water intake, not physiological impairment, as the cause. To test this possibility, rats were given a choice between two drinking water solutions. One contained distilled water, the other cadmium. Concentrations as low as 1 ppm were rejected by some rats. Additional studies showed that chronic cadmium exposure modified the intake pattern of saccharin solutions typical of rats, and that the addition of saccharin to the 150 ppm cadmium solution did not reduce its aversive properties. These data indicated that the taste of cadmium, at least in solution, is aversive to rats. Since taste aversion can reduce fluid and food consumption, and consequently body weight, properly designed experiments must include adequate control procedures such as pair-feeding and pair-watering to differentiate unique effects of cadmium from those produced by undernutrition.",Immunology

Of 11 patients with pure seminomas, nine (82%) are free of disease from 6 months to 15 years following therapy. The primary treatment modality in these patients was mediastinal radiation; one patient with metastatic disease had a complete remission and prolonged survival following combination chemotherapy. Seventeen patients had GCT with nonseminomatous elements. Only three (18%) are alive and free of disease. One patient treated only surgically is alive at 15 years and two patients treated with combination chemotherapy and operation are alive and free of disease at 6 months and 3 years. When analyzed by a Kaplan-Meier actuarial survival estimate, patients with nonseminomatous GCT who were treated with cisplatin-bleomycin-based chemotherapy had a median survival of 14.0 months whereas those treated with chemotherapy regimens not employing these agents had a median survival of 4.0 months (generalized Wilcoxon test, p = 0.0495).

Results show that interactional correlates of traditional marital and sex role variations are attenuated, that communication between spouses is improved, and that the therapeutic quality of verbal behavior is enhanced over the course of therapy.

The effects of platelet-derived growth factor and plasma components on saturation density in cultures of 3T3 cells were investigated. Both of these components of whole blood serum affect saturation density; however, when 3T3 cells become quiescent at high density in medium containing whole blood serum, only platelet-derived growth factor and fresh whole blood serum are capable of stimulating proliferation. Addition of fresh plasma- derived serum has little effect on cell growth. These results suggest that the platelet factor is the major determinant of saturation density in cultures of 3T3 cells maintained in medium supplemented with whole blood serum. Experiments were performed to investigate the mechanism by which platelet-derived growth factor regulates saturation density. We investigated the possibilities of inactivation of growth factors by proliferating cells, and the effects of cell density on the response of 3T3 cells to platelet-derived growth factor. The amount of platelet- derived growth factor required to initiated DNA synthesis increases with increasing cell density. Some inactivation of growth factors by growing cells was detected, but this depletion was only evident at high cell density. We propose that density-dependent inhibition in cultured 3T3 cells is the result both of an increased requirement for the platelet- derived growth factor as the cultures become more crowded and of inactivation of growth factor activity by growing cells.",Immunology
7372710,"Early events in the cellular formation of proparathyroid hormone. Early events in the cellular synthesis and subsequent transfer into membrane-limited compartments of pre-proparathyroid hormone (pre-proPTH) and proparathyroid hormone (proPTH) were investigated by electrophoretic analyses of newly synthesized proteins in subcellular fractions of parthyroid gland slices pulse-labeled for 0.5-5 min with [(35)S] methionine. During these short times of incubation, both pre-proPTH and proPTH were confined to the microsomal fraction. Labeled pre-proPTH and proPTH were detected in a 30-s interval between 0.5 and 1.0 min of incubation. The radioactivity in proPTH became relatively constant between 3 and 5 min, whereas the radioactivity in ProPTH increased markedly over this period. When corrected for the known content of methionine in the prohormone and the prohormone, we found four times as much radiolabeled prohormone as prehormone between 0.5 and 1.0 min of synthesis. Sequestration of labeled prohomrone into endoplasmic reticulum compartments was shown by treatment of the microsomal fraction with chymotrypsin and trypsin, which resulted in the degradation of the prehormone but not of the prohormones. Approximately 50 percent of pre-prohormone and 25 percent of prohormone were released from the microsomes by their extraction with 1.0 M KCl, whereas 80-90 percent of both was released by treatment with Triton X-100. These results in intact cells support the signal hypothesis proposed by Blobel and his co-workers in studies utilizing cell-free systems, inasmuch as the results indicate transfer of prohormone into the cisternal space of the rough endoplasmic reticulum concomitant with the growth of the nascent polypeptide chain. Appearance of membrane-sequestered proPTH takes place without entry of pre-proPTH into the cisternal space, suggesting that proteolytic removal of the leader peptide occurs during transfer of the polypeptide through the lipid bilayer. Further evidence in support of this process is that pre-proPTH is only partly extracted from the microsomes by treatment with 1.0 M KCl, suggesting that a substantial fraction of the nascent pre-proPTH is integrally inserted into the membranes before it is cleaved to form proPTH.",Immunology

The chemical groups binding calcium and lead on the erythrocytes were also investigated. Calcium ions in the plasma were shown to be capable of replacing the 203Pb on the red cells. More than 85% of the 203Pb in the erythrocyte was associated with the cytoplasmic components, and the rest was bound to the stromal membrane. About 90% of 45Ca was attached to erythrocyte membrane. Extraction of 45Ca and 203Pb-labelled erythrocyte membranes with chloroform/methanol mixture showed that the distribution patterns of these two nuclides are similar, with over 88% protein bound, less than 10% lipid bound, and traces in the aqueous phase. Chemical modification of erythrocyte membrane proteins with carbodi-imide, p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB), and maleic anhydride suggested that the carboxyl groups are responsible for binding lead and calcium to the red cell membrane. The SH groups may have a minor role in the binding for both cations. Amino groups did not appear to affect the binding of these cations. Gel chromatography of 45Ca-labelled erythrocyte membrane indicated that Ca++ bound to the same fraction of membrane proteins as 203Pb, corresponding to a molecular weight of about 130 000 to 230 000.

The electrodes were compared for ability to produce knee extension torque, electrical impedance, ease of application, durability, comfort, and skin reactivity. Felt-pad electrodes soaked in tap water or saline produced the highest mean torque and lowest electrical impedance, which made them excellent choices for single session stimulation. Carbon-rubber electrodes with either gel produced slightly less torque, slightly higher impedances, and only minor skin reactions. They were relatively easy to apply, and the majority remained intact for the duration of the study period. They were found to be most suitable for prolonged functional electrical stimulation of the quadriceps. Stimulation using pregelled electrodes produced the lowest torque, and they displayed consistently higher electrical impedance. Even though they were easiest to apply and survived better than the other electrodes, they also produced the most skin reactions.

In 1973, our study of patients with resectable hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer compared survival of 60 patients who had metastases removed with survival of 60 patients with similar lesions that had been biopsied only. We concluded that excision of small, apparently solitary metastatic lesions could be justified on the basis of the low operative risk and prolonged survival. However, the risks and benefits of resection of larger metastatic lesions could not be determined by that earlier study, because only seven of those patients had lesions so large as to require major hepatic resection. Therefore, to evaluate size as a determinant of prognosis after resection, we added to those 7 patients 27 others who were managed since 1973 by major hepatic resection of larger metastases. There were two hospital deaths. Of the 32 surviving patients, 82% lived one year or more, 77% 18 months or more, 58% two years or more, and 41% three years or more postoperatively.

Counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIEP) was used to determine precipitating antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae retrospectively in sera from 100 patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), 125 medical and neurological controls, and 40 normal individuals. Sera from 7 patients produced precipitin lines. These positive cases included 5 patients with GBS, 1 with acute cerebellar ataxia, and 1 with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. A complement-fixation test performed with the same antigen showed titers to M. pneumoniae of 1:512 or greater in these 7 sera. In contrast, sera from other patient controls and normal individuals were negative by CIEP and had only low mycoplasma complement-fixation antibody titers. No distinguishing clinical features separated the 5 seropositive GBS patients from the whole group except for their young age, which parallels that for human mycoplasma infection in general. Additional laboratory findings consistent with acute mycoplasma infection were demonstrated in 6 of the 7 seropositive patients.",Immunology

Results of our experience with 186 patients treated at Wayne State University Affiliated Hospitals from 1970 through 1978 dispute this concept and suggest that a definitive operation is the procedure of choice. One hundred and thirty-seven of the patients were treated with an omental patch, and 47 underwent a definitive operation; 114 of the patients were available for an 18 month follow-up study. It was found that previous ulcer symptoms were not an accurate predictor of the need for a subsequent definitive operation and that mortality was determined by the age and condition of the patient at the time of operation rather than by the choice of operation itself. It is recommended that the perforation itself is an indication for a definitive operation unless the patient is in a state of shock at the time of operation.

The importance of the colon for the absorption of calcium, fat, and fluid was studied in 118 patients with small-bowel resections of various lengths. The patients fell into two groups: 38 with ileostomy and 80 with part of or the whole colon in function. In patients with ileostomy, but not in patients with the colon preserved, the absorption of 47Ca and fluid was inversely correlated to the length of the resected small intestine. In patients with extreme small-bowel resection (greater than or equal to 150 cm) the 47Ca absorption was significantly higher when colon was preserved. In groups of equal small-bowel resections stool mass was significantly higher in patients with ileostomy, but faecal fat was not. However, in both groups faecal fat was correlated to the length of the resected small bowel. The study shows that colon plays an important role for the absorption of calcium after small-intestinal resection and confirms the importance of colon for fluid absorption.",Immunology

In 1977, a unique event occurred in the epidemiology of influenza when a virus of the influenza A (H1N1) subtype, similar to a virus that had occurred in 1950, reappeared and caused worldwide epidemics but did not replace the prevailing influenza A (H2N2) subtype. Consequently, the two viruses co-circulated throughout the world and mixed infection of some individuals with both virus strains was detected, raising the possiblitity that recombination between the two strains might affect the future epidemiological behaviour of influenza. Serological analysis of virus isolates from influenza outbreaks during the winter of 1978-79, however, failed to detect any antigenic hybrids (H2N1 or H1N2). The investigation described here, was therefore, undertaken to detect recombinants among recent isolates of the H1N1 and H3N1 serotypes, involving genes coding for other than the surface proteins by RNA-RNA hybridisation. We report here the genetic characterisation of recombinants of both antigenic types.",Immunology

Neither clinical severity nor erythrocyte adherence correlates significantly with red-cell indexes, hemoglobin concentration, percentage of irreversibly sickled red cells, level of fetal hemoglobin, or reticulocyte count. However, clinical severity and erythrocyte adherence are strongly correlated (rank correlation coefficient = +0.666; P less than 0.001).

Serum antibody responses to primary and secondary infections with respiratory syncytial virus were determined in 67 hospitalized infants. Responses in IgG, IgM, and IgA immunoglobulin fractions were assayed using an indirect immunofluorescent technique. Infection was confirmed by identification of RSV antigen in nasopharyngeal secretions using indirect immunofluorescence, and by recovery of the virus in tissue culture. IgM specific antibody response was commonly observed within a few days of onset of primary infection and persisted from two to ten weeks. Increases in titer of virus-specific IgG and IgA were observed in infants aged 6 months or more at the time of infection than in younger infants. At one year after primary infection, IgA and IgM specific antibody was undetectable, and IgG antibody was absent or present in low titer. Subsequent reinfection result ed in accelerated antibody response in all three classes of serum immunoglobulin. High titers of RSV-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody were detectable at five and seven days after reinfection. These observations may explain the relatively mild nature of clinical illness associated with RSV reinfections in childhood.",Immunology

Higher concentrations of [D-Trp11]-NT displayed NT-like activity. In rat stomach strips and guinea pig atria, [D-Trp11]-NT exhibits full intrinsic activity, markedly reduced affinity for NT receptors, but no inhibitory effect against NT.

In experiment 2, when incidental words were rhymes or synonyms of central words, fourth graders performed as well as did adults in the central phase of the task. Also, fourth graders were as likely to recognize incidental words which had rhymed as those that had been synonyms of central words; adults recognized more synonyms than rhymes.

7363633,"Postshock arrhythmias--a possible cause of unsuccessful defibrillation. Clinical and experimental information exists in the literature which suggests that defibrillation with higher energies than are required results in a decreased percentage of success. Previous work in this laboratory which showed the occurrence of postshock arrhythmias caused by a prolonged depolarization of the cell membrane in myocardial cells in vitro, led to the hypothesis that the decreased percent success at high energies in vivo might be due to the development of similar shock-induced arrhythmias which could immediately refibrillate the heart. The purpose of these experiments was to test this hypothesis. Myocardial cells grown in vitro were subjected to rectangular wave electric field stimulation of varying intensity and duration. Postshock arrhythmias were evaluated using a photovoltaic cell mounted on a closed-circuit television monitor. The photocell converted the change in light intensity produced as the cell contracted to an electrical signal which was read out on a strip chart. Strength-duration curves were formed both for excitation (production of a single extrasystole) and for specific degrees of arrhythmia. These were compared with strength-duration curves obtained for a specific percent success defibrillation in vivo by other investigators. These experiments showed a close similarity between the in vivo and in vitro data, thus, strengthening the hypothesis that decreasing percentage of success of defibrillation with increasing intensity at high energies is due to secondary arrhythmias produced by the shock. The experiments further suggest that in vitro myocardial cells are a valuable screening system for determining waveforms which maximize the ratio between the voltages producing postshock arrhythmias and those producing excitation (defibrillation). This ratio, defined as the ""safety factor"" of the waveform, varies with the duration of the rectangular wave. Durations having high safety factors can produce defibrillation with a high percentage of success; however, waveforms having low safety factors make it impossible to achieve a high percentage of success defibrillation with any applied voltage. This information suggests that the minimum voltage required for successful defibrillation always be used and that defibrillators be produced with waveforms which maximize the safety factor.",Immunology

High fever, a serum bilirubin level above 4 mg/dl, and hypotension characterized the most severe refractory cases in which emergency surgery was mandatory. Patients without manifestations were nearly always controlled successfully with antibiotics. We conclude that the term ""suppurative cholangitis"" is an unsatisfactory synonym for severe cholangitis, because the correlation between biliary suppuration and clinical manifestations in cholangitis is inexact; some patients with severe sepsis do not have pus in the bile duct, and a few patients with suppurative bile are only moderately ill.",Immunology

In addition, snips containing microfilariae were incubated in NCTC 135 or in saline and the number of emerged microfilariae was determined at various intervals of time up to 24 hours. After incubation, snips were either fixed in 10% formalin, serially sectioned, and the microfilariae counted, or they were digested in collagenase solution to free unemerged microfilaire. Of the total number of microfilariae present in the snips, 43.9% +/- 18.5, 80.2% +/- 22.2, 83.0% +/- 19.5, and 85.3% +/- 18.0 had emerged by 0.5, 4, 8, and 24 hours of incubation, respectively.

Biochemical studies have shown that the ability of erythrosine to inhibit dopamine uptake into brain synaptosomal preparations is dependent on the concentration of tissue present in the assay mixture. Thus, the finding that erythrosine inhibits dopamine uptake (which, if true, would provide a plausible explanation of the Feingold hypothesis of childhood hyperactivity) may simply be an artifact that results from nonspecific interactions with brain membranes. In addition, although erythrosine given parenterally (50 milligrams per kilogram) did not alter locomotor activity of control of 6-hydroxydopamine-treated rats, erythrosine (50 to 300 milligrams per kilogram) attenuated the effect of punishment in a ""conflict"" paradigm.",Immunology

7351443,"A mechanism for the guidance and topographic patterning of retinal ganglion cell axons. Three dimensional reconstruction, with the use of serial, 1-micrometer sections, has revealed a system of oriented intercellular spaces within the undifferentiated optic cup. These large openings appear in the marginal zone of the primitive retina and optic stalk prior to the formation of the first retinal ganglion cell axons. The spaces at the region of the optic disc form sets of long, interconnecting tunnels oriented in the direction of the stalk. The spaces at the back and rim of the cup form blind, radially arranged pockets. The extracellular tunnels of the optic disc region strictly maintain their positions in relation to the optic fissure and, thus, discrete portions of the retina become connected by continuous openings with equivalent regions in the stalk. The path taken by the earliest outgrowing optic fibers is identical to the one previously established by the intercellular tunnels. We propose that the tunnel and pocket layout may provide directional and topographic information to the first forming optic axons.",Immunology

Experimental deficiencies of cyanocobalamin and folacin separately and in combination were induced in an air-breathing teleost fish Channa punctatus with the help of a complete vitamin test diet. Cyanocobalamin deficiency produced normocytic hypochromic anaemia while the folacin deficiency as well as the combined deficiency of both vitamins produced macrocytic hypochromic anaemia. Leucocytosis was observed in the individual and combined deficiencies of these vitamins with significant increase in thrombocytes and decrease in neutrophil population. The relative population of different developing stages in erythropoiesis showed significant change. Thus small lymphoid haemoblast decreased in number while young and mature reticulocyte populations increased. Recovery to normal condition could be obtained by restoring deficient groups of fishes to complete vitamin test diet fortified with an initial i.m. administration of 0.01 mg/g and 0.02 mg/g body wt. of cyanocobalamin and folacin respectively.

Serum ferritin and HLA antigens were assessed in all members, and adults underwent radioiron investigations and liver biopsy. 2 members of the second generation and 1 of the third generation, all of whom had thalassaemia trait, had elevated liver iron concentration, indicating preclinical iron overload. This was not associated with any HLA type. None of the subjects had been treated with exogenous iron. The one member of the second generation who had thalassaemia minor but not iron overload was female, and the 5 members of the third generation with the trait, but with normal serum ferritin levels, were all under the age of 15 years. Members of the family without beta-thalassaemia minor had normal iron metabolism.

There was a fall in plasma methionine and a rise in plasma serine levels. There were no significant changes in glycine and histidine levels. Homocysteine and S-methylcysteine were not detected in rat plasmas. The fall in plasma methionine was due to loss of cobalamin-dependent methionine synthetase activity.

In both groups the patients showed decreases in body weight, abdominal girth, edema, hepatomegaly, blood pressure, and heart rate. Commonly observed decreases frequently achieved statistical significance, more often with bumetanide, but the differences between treatments were rarely statistically significant.

In contrast, ALP activity in endometrial glandular cells was found to be heat and LP sensitive. Of 183 cases of cervical neoplasia, 60 (33%) manifested non-specific ALP activity. One dysplasia and two invasive cancer cases manifested the Regan-like isoenzyme. The other 36 classifiable lesions had small-intestine ALP-like activity (marked heat and LP sensitivity) or a liver ALP-like isoenzyme (marked heat and slight LP sensitivity). Of 42 cases of endometrial cancer, all cases manifested non-specific ALP activity. Seven endometrial cancers exhibited the Regan-like isoenzyme. The other 19 cases manifested either small intestine or liver ALP-like isoenzyme.

The epithelial lining of the anal canal is of colo-rectal type in the upper part and squamous in the lower part, while the middle zone is called the anal transitional zone (ATZ). This zone is characterized by an epithelium which bears a resemblance to that of the anal glands and shows little mucus secretion. The histochemical properties of the mucins in the epithelium of 39 anal canals, resected for ano-rectal adenocarcinoma, basaloid carcinoma, squamous carcinoma and malignant melanoma were investigated. The study reveals that (1) the mucin composition of the ATZ epithelium corresponds to that of the anal glands, being characterized by a mixture of sulpho- and sialomucins with scarcity or absence of O-acylated sialic acids; and (2) cases with carcinomas located near the dentate line show changes in the mucin composition of the adjoining anal canal epithelium, regardless of tumour type. In colo-rectal type mucosa, these mucins consist of increasing amounts of sialomucins with a predominance of N-acyl derivatives, and in the anal glands of increasing amounts of sulphomucins and O-acyl derivatives of sialomucins. No changes could be detected in the ATZ epithelium. It is concluded that rectal and anal glands in the anal canal are exposed to stimuli which alter the normal process of glycoprotein synthesis and secretion.

Appropriate control experiments indicated that deposition of reaction product depended on the presence of cholesterol and the necessary enzymes. Comparison studies using digitonin confirmed the presence of cholesterol in the lipid droplets, but ultrastructural distortion limited the resolution of the more discrete deposits of cholesterol than the digitonin method because it does not cause distortion of cellular ultrastructure attributed to the formation of cholesterol digitonide.

We have developed a highly sensitive radioimmunoassay of thyroxine and thyrotropin for mass screening for neonatal hypothyroidism. This assay involves a single disc (3 mm diameter) of dried blood on filter paper. The minimum detectable concentrations are 15 pg/tube (10 microgram/L) for thyroxine and 15 nano-int. units/tube (10 milli-int. units/L) for thyrotropin; intra- and interassay CV's are less than 15% in both assays. The high sensitivity of this method is due to use of labeled thyroxine with high specific activity (3 kCi/g) and of an anti-thyrotropin serum with high affinity (Keq = 7.8 x 10(11) L/mol). With this method, 11337 newborns were screened; a follow-up study revealed that only newborns with both high thyrotropin and low thyroxine concentrations had permanent hypothyroidism.

A study has been made of the regulation of evoked release of the amino acid neurotransmitter candidates (aspartate, GABA and taurine) from rat olfactory cortex slices. The effects of pentobarbitone (10-1000 microM) on release have also been assessed. Release of aspartate, the presumed excitatory transmitter of some of the lateral olfactory tract fibres, is reduced by muscimol (10 microM) and this effect is antagonized by picrotoxin (15 microM): it is concluded that presynaptic GABA receptors may modulate aspartate release. Low concentrations of pentobarbitone also reduce aspartate release, but this effect is picrotoxin-insensitive. Release of GABA, the presumed transmitter of inhibitory interneurones, is reduced by muscimol (10 microM) and this effect is antagonized by picrotoxin (15 microM): it is suggested that GABA release may be regulated by presynaptic autoreceptors. Pentobarbitone significantly increases release of GABA when slices are synaptically activated although the mechanism of this effect is unclear. Release of taurine, not hitherto considered a neurotransmitter in this brain area, is depressed by muscimol (10 microM) and pentobarbitone and increased by picrotoxin (15 microM). Results are discussed in terms of (i) mechanisms of regulation of amino acid release in the olfactory cortex, (ii) effects of pentobarbitone on release and (iii) the compatibility of the present results with previously published electrophysiological studies.",Immunology

The rate and pattern of seizure development provoked by repeated electrical stimulation of the amygdala (kindling) was assessed in rats that had been pretreated with intracerebral injections of the selective catecholaminergic neurotoxin 6-hydroxy-dopamine. Rats with selective depletion of forebrain noradrenaline displayed a highly significant facilitation of both primary-site and secondary-site kindling, whereas no such effect occurred in rats with selective depletion of forebrain dopamine. The facilitative effects of noradrenaline depletion were apparently related to disinhibition of the spread of seizure discharge from the stimulated site rather than to increased epileptogenicity in the stimulated site itself. These results are consistent with previous evidence that noradrenaline reduces the susceptibility of the central nervous system to epileptiform activity, and they suggest that a lessening of seizure-suppressant noradrenergic function in the forebrain might be part of the mechanism underlying kindling.",Immunology

Based on estimated s-values of subpopulations of bovine adrenal chromaffin granules (Bødtker-Naess, V., Slinde, E., Terland, O. and Flatmark, T. (1978) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 541, 124--134) a new large-scale procedure is described for the isolation of the total population of chromaffin granules by differential centrifugation in 0.25 M sucrose. 2. Using the total population of chromaffin granules obtained by differential centrifugation, final purification was achieved by density-gradient centrifugation in either sucrose or Percoll-sucrose. In either case, the isolated granule fractions were contaminated with mitochondria to about the same degree. 3. Chromaffin granule ghosts, obtained by hypoosmotic lysis of granules isolated by sucrose density-gradient, centrifugation, were subjected to centrifugation on a discontinuous density gradient (buffer/0.9 M sucrose). By this procedure a substantial purification of the ghosts was achieved as determined from measurements of protein and various marker enzymes. 4. In contrast to preparations of chromaffin granule ghosts prepared by previous standard procedures, those purified by gradient centrifugation (on 0.9 M sucrose) did not reveal any NADH-linked cytochrome b-561 reductase activity. However, experimental evidence is presented for the existence of an intrinsic NADH-oxidizing enzyme system in the granule membrane. 5. No significant difference was observed in the specific content of cytochrome b.561 and NADH:(acceptor) oxidoreductase activities between ghost preparations obtained from populations of heavy and light chromaffin granules. 6. The functional significance of cytochrome b-561 and the NADH:(acceptor) oxidoreductase activities of the granule membrane remains to be determined.",Immunology

We administered indomethacin orally for the treatment of premature labor in a prospective, randomized, double-blind fashion, and all infants were followed up. Indomethacin was significantly more effective than placebo in inhibition of premature labor during a 24-hour course of therapy, with treatment failure during therapy occurring in only one of 15 indomethacin-treated patients compared to nine of 15 placebo-treated patients (p less than 0.01). Mean plasma concentrations of indomethacin were approximately 0.8 micrograms/ml at both 4 and 12 hours after administration. Mean plasma levels of 15-oxo-13,14-dihydroprostaglandin F2 alpha (PGFM) were similar in the two groups before treatment, decreased markedly in the indomethacin group by 4 hours, and were not detected at 12 hours in all but the one indomethacin-treated patient who was delivered within 24 hours. Patients in the placebo group who were delivered prematurely had higher pretreatment PGFM levels (mean +/- SE, 83 +/- 18 pg/ml, n = 9) than the patients who responded to placebo (25 +/- 6 pg/ml, n = 6) (p less than 0.05). There was no difference between the indomethacin and placebo groups with respect to gestational age at delivery, birth weight, and neonatal morbidity and deaths. In particular, we found no evidence of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hypertension, or increase in bleeding problems among the infants exposed to indomethacin in utero. Although no difference in neonatal outcome was observed in this small number of patients, it would seem prudent still to consider indomethacin as an experimental therapy.",Immunology

Experiments were performed to examine whether non-hydroxylated tryptamines and 4-chloroamphetamine utilize the membrane 5-hydroxytryptamine carrier to pass into serotoninergic neurones. The accumulation and deamination of 14C-tryptamine by mouse brain slices or homogenates of rat hypothalamus were not inhibited by cocaine or norzimelidine, a selective inhibitor of the neuronal 5-HT uptake. The prevention by alpha-methyltryptamine (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), alpha-ethyltryptamine (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and 4-chloroamphetamine (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally) of the irreversible inhibtion of monoamine oxidase by pheniprazine (2.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and clorgyline (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally) in serotoninergic synaptosomes from mouse brain was not antagonized by pretreatment of the animals with norzimelidine (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally). The partial preventing effect of alpha-ethyl-4-methyl-m-tyramine (H 75/12)(2 X 50 mg/kg intraperitoneally) was, on the other hand, antagonized by norzimelidine. These results do not support the hypothesis that non-hydroxylated tryptamines and 4-chloroamphetamine are transported by the 5-HT carrier.",Immunology

Findings in the aspiration specimens, consisting of solitary glomeruli, were regarded as diagnostic in 35% of the cases. When considered together with clinical data, the fine-needle aspiration biopsies were suggestive of diagnosis or provided valuable information in a further 49% of the cases. Due to the small outer diameter of the fine-needle, 0.7 mm, complications following this kind of biopsy are practically negligible. Thus, it offers a safe alternative to the conventional renal biopsy methods utilizing large-bored cutting needles in cases where biopsies with these methods are contraindicated.",Immunology

In the bilateral VUR group, one kidney was roentgenologically normal and the other was growth-retarded. The GFR was estimated in 19 of the children. The age of the children was 3-17 years and all had a history of urinary tract infection. The size of the smaller kidney varied between 33-97% of normal. Children in the unilateral VUR group with a small kidney due to scarring and/or growth retardation showed a varying degree of compensatory hypertrophy in the contralateral kidney, which was proportional to the parenchymal reduction. This compensation was inhibited in the bilateral VUR group. There was a positive correlation between the GFR and kidney size.",Immunology

Manometric recordings of the internal anal sphincter activity are frequently used in the diagnosis of Hirschprung's disease. Normally, there is a relaxation of the internal sphincter in response to a rectal distension, but this is absent in Hirschprung's disease. In order to study the normal physiology during the first days of life, 17 healthy full-term infants were examined daily with ano-rectal manometry during the first four days of life. Resting anal pressure was lower than in older children. Internal sphincter relaxation was recorded in all infants but one on the first day, in all on the second and finally in all but one on the third and fourth days. The results indicate that anorectal manometry may be used in the diagnosis of Hirschprung's disease also in the newborn period.

Antisera were raised in rabbits against 11-deoxycortisol-21-hemisuccinate-bovine serum albumin (11-DOC-21-HS-BSA) and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone-3-carboxymethyloxime-bovine serum albumin (17-OHP-3-CMO-BSA). An antiserum to 11-DOC-21-HS-BSA exhibited cross-reaction with progesterone (29%), 11-deoxycortisol (100%), cortisol (17%) and testosterone (10%) and was therefore not appropriate for quantitation of 17-OHP in plasma. An antiserum to 17-OHP-3-CMO-BSA cross-reacted with progesterone (9,7%), 11-deoxycortisol (50%) and less than 1% with all other major naturally occurring steroid hormones. A radio-immunoassay (RIA) was developed using the antiserum to 17-OHP-4-CMO-BSA. The intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation were 7,2% and 10,5% respectively. The normal ranges (nmol/l plasma) of samples extracted with hexane:benzene (1:1) and purified by Sephadex LH-20 chromatography were 0,28-4,7 for men, 0,84-3,0 for women (follicular phase), 3,0-11,0 for women (luteal phase), 4,6-22,1 for pregnant women, 18,5-123,9 for cord blood, 0,12-5,0 for children and 56,3-1 032 for persons with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to a 21-hydroxylation enzyme defect.

During a period of five years, 361 patients each had cytologic examination of a specimen aspirated by percutaneous needle biopsy from a superficial lymph node. Fifty-five aspirates were considered unsatisfactory owing to scanty cellularity, and 22 were excluded because of lack of adequate follow-up. Of the remaining 284 aspirates, 81% were positive for malignant cells; 19% were considered negative. There were no cases with false-positive diagnoses. However, of 52 negative aspirates, 31 revealed tumor on subsequent excisional biopsy. Seventy-two percent of patients were admitted with prior history of malignancy. For both males and females, an apparent correlation was found between regional distribution of positive lymph nodes and the histologic types of primary tumors. Eighty-two percent of the positive cervical nodes in males and 56% in females were associated with epidermoid carcinoma. Most of the positive supraclavicular and axillary lymph nodes occurred in females and were associated with mammary carcinoma. Diagnosis of malignant neoplasms is feasible, in most instances, from nodal aspirates, but specific diagnosis of the histologic type of the tumor, e.g., malignant lymphoma, should be rendered only when the cytologic findings are supported by appropriate clinical and laboratory findings. In case of doubt, or if the aspirate contains many polymorphonuclear leukocytes, necrotic debris, or bizarre epithelioid cells, granulomatous lymphadenitis should be suspected and the diagnosis should be deferred until formal tissue biopsy can be obtained.",Immunology

The clinical and electrophysiologic features of eight patients with unusually rapid, medically refractory paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia are described. Exercise induction of tachycardia and functional bundle branch block patterns during tachycardia were common. Tachycardia resulted from anterograde enhanced atrioventricular nodal conduction combined with retrograde conduction by a concealed left atrial-left ventricular accessory pathway producing rates ranging from 200 to 300 beats/min. Management and late follow-up study were characterized by generally unsuccessful electrophysiologic-pharmacologic testing and inconsistent rhythm control with continued drug therapy. Three patients underwent successful surgical interruption of the concealed accessory pathway, with elimination of recurrent tachycardias. These patients represent a unique subgroup with an identifiable electrophysiologic basis for unusually rapid tachycardias, potentially benefiting from invasive study and aggressive therapy.",Immunology

The Swedish Board of Health and Welfare supplied a large amount of the data needed; the rest were obtained from a six-page questionnaire to which 81% of the doctors replied. Analysis of these data revealed several statistically significant sex differences, including the following: The women were born to older fathers and better educated mothers. They married later, and had fewer children. They were less often engaged in in-patient somatic care and more often in in-patient psychiatric care. They were less often head doctors, less often in teaching departments and less often medical teachers; female graduates of more than 10 years' standing were less often employed in hospitals than their male counterparts.

Experiments were conducted to determine if the attachment of T. congolense, alone or in combination with antitrypanosome antibody, was damaging to host cells. Bovine erythrocytes were labelled with 51Cr and incubated with T. congolense to promote adhesion. Plasma from the same donor as the red blood cells was added to the erythrocyte-trypanosome aggregates and the release of 51Cr measured. There was a two- to threefold increase in 51Cr release when trypanosomes were lysed by antibody-complement interaction following adhesion to the erythrocyte. The erythrocytes were not damaged by trypanosome binding in the absence of antibody or complement. A similar mechanism may operate in vivo because experiments demonstrated an increased vascular permeability of mesenteric vessels, a site of T. congolense attachment to the microcirculation. These results suggest that the adhesion of T. congolense to host cells, followed by an immune response to the parasite, may damage the infected host by ""innocent bystander"" mechanisms.",Immunology

It is concluded that this difference arises from differences in tertiary structure in the vicinity of the beta 93 site. Organic phosphates decrease the beta 93 sulfhydryl reactivity. We have used this effect to measure the organic phosphate binding constants. Hemoglobin S binds organic phosphates very weakly compared to hemoglobin A. This result indicates that the structure at the organic phosphate binding site is different in the two oxyhemoglobins and may be the result of differences in the structure of the NH2-terminal ends of the beta chains.",Immunology

Resistance to 10 microgram/ml of puromycin has been analyzed in V79 Chinese hamster cells. Clones that were isolated in 10 microgram/ml of puromycin and subsequently cultivated in its absence consistently lost their resistance. One clone was analyzed in detail by recloning in the presence and absence of puromycin, and it was found that non-puromycin cultivated subclones also lost their resistance and regained inhibition profiles similar to the V79 parent. Reconstruction experiments between sensitive and resistant cells demonstrated that the yield of mutants was not affected by metabolic cooperation. The mutation rate was calculated to be 1 x 10(-7) per cell generation, and was the same within the limits of statistical error in a colchicine-produced polyploid derivative of the V79 line. Although a number of resistant clones were found to have polyploid karyotypes, the polyploid V79 lines was not more resistant to puromycin, nor did it possess a higher frequency of puromycin resistant cells. Studies employing radiolabeled puromycin established that resistance was due to a lowered uptake of puromycin and that an inverse relationship existed between resistance level and uptake rate.",Immunology

Juvenile does were actively immunized against oestradiol-17 beta, testosterone, progesterone or BSA. Depending on the antigen, the antibody titres at 17 weeks ranged between less than 1:10,000 and 1:500,000. Specificity of the antisera was high as judged by cross-reactivity studies. However, significant binding of [3H]oestradiol-17 beta (7-30%) was observed in 1:100 diluted sera raised against testosterone, and 21-48% binding of [3H]testosterone in sera raised against oestradiol-17 beta (binding in control animals being 1-8%). Total serum oestradiol-17 beta levels (RIA) were not only elevated (P less than or equal to 0.05, compared to controls) in does immunized with oestradiol-17 beta but also in does immunized with testosterone. Production of antibodies against progesterone did not interfere with receptivity but none of the does gave birth. Receptivity and consequently pregnancy were prevented by immunization against oestradiol-17 beta, suggesting that oestrogen is necessary for receptivity in the rabbit. Receptivity was also blocked in does immunized against testosterone.

Twelve term infants with clinical complications of asphyxia, acidosis, respiratory distress, or sepsis, and 17 preterm infants with no complications had lower serum albumin concentrations and slightly reduced binding capacity and affinity compared to the healthy term infants.

Ca2+-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase from various mammalian tissues (Takai, Y., Kishimoto, A., Iwasa, Y., Kawahara, Y., Mori, T., and Nishizuka, Y (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 3692-3695) was greatly stimulated by the addition of diacylglycerol at less than 5% (w/w) the concentration of phospholipid. This stimulation was due to an increase in the apparent affinity of enzyme for phospholipid and to a concomitant decrease in the Ka value for Ca2+ from about 1 x 10(-4) M to the micromolar range. Diacylglycerol alone showed little or no effect on enzymatic activity over a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations. This effect was greatest for diacylglycerol which contained unsaturated fatty acid at least at position 2. The active diacylglycerols so far tested included diolein, dilinolein, diarachidonin, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl diglyceride, and 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl diglyceride. In contrast, diacylglycerols containing saturated fatty acids such as dipalmitin and distearin were far less effective. Triacyl- and monoacylglycerols were totally ineffective, irrespective of the fatty acyl moieties. Cholesterol and free fatty acids were also ineffective. Based on these observations, a possible coupling is proposed between the protein kinase activation and phosphatidylinositol turnover which can be provoked by various extracellular messengers.",Immunology

Reticular neuron activity was recorded in 28 chloralosed cats in order to analyze the reflex arc of the spino-bulbo-spinal (SBS) reflex. Three types of reticular neurons, types I (input), II(output) and III (relay), were identified by unit discharges in response to stimulation of the sural nerve. (1) Type I (input) neurons received spinal ascending volleys monosynaptically and responded to stimulation of the sural nerve with spikes of low amplitude and short latency. Unit spikes, however, were not produced by stimulation of the superficial radial nerve and the sensorimotor cortex. These input neurons were located in the dorsocaudal part of the medial bulbar reticular formation. (2) Type II (output) neurons were part of the reticulospinal tract, which sends axons to the spinal cord, since these neurons exhibited antidromic spikes following stimulation of the ventrolateral funiculus of the spinal cord. Unit spikes were evoked by stimulation either to the sural or superficial radial nerves. These neurons were located in the ventrocaudal part of the medial bulbar reticular formation. (3) Type III neurons included relay neurons. Unit spikes were evoked by stimulation of the sural nerve, superficial radial nerve and sensorimotor cortex. However, unit discharges were not obtained by antidromic stimulation to the reticulospinal tract. These neurons were distributed widely in the brain stem, both in the bulb and pons. (4) Latency difference of unit discharges between input and output neurons was 3.5--5 msec, indicating the presence of interneurons (relays) between input and output neurons. Spikes of output neurons with 3.8--4.2 msec latency were observed following stimulation of the region where input neuron activity was found.

The dynamics of human apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) interaction with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) vesicles were investigated in a 4000:1 DMPC/apo A-I (mol/mol) mixture where all the protein is bound to DMPC in stable vesicular complexes, and in a 100:1 DMPC/apo A-I (mol/mol) mixture which gives micellar complexes at equilibrium. Gel filtration and fluorescence methods (polarization and intensity) were used to follow the reaction kinetics. The binding of apo A-I to DMPC vesicles is a very rapid process which takes only a few minutes, while the formation of micellar complexes takes several hours at 25 degrees C and involves saturated complexes of apo A-I . DMPC and free apo A-I.

The clinical picture of the extrapyramid disturbances was examined in 52 patients with hypertensive disease and atherosclerosis who had suffered an ischemic cerebral stroke. In 40 cases electromyographic, and in 26 cases pathomorphological examinations were performed. The extrapyramid disturbances are demonstrated with reference to the affection of one or another vascular basin. In ischemic strokes associated with circulatory disorders in the carotid artery basin the following variants of the extrapyramid disturbances were revealed : a) contralateral extrapyramid-pyramid syndrome; b) homolateral extrapyramid syndrome; c) hyperkinetic syndrome. In ischemic strokes due to circulatory disorders in the vertebrobasilar basin the disturbances revealed were: extrapyramid-pyramid-pseudobulbar syndrome (a variant of Filimonov's syndrome) and akinetic rigidity syndrome. The results of the above clinico-physiological examinations were compared with pathoanatomical findings. This comparison has made it possible to expand to a certain extent and concepts about the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the complicate clinical picture of the extrapyramid disturbances developed in ischemic cerebral stroke.",Immunology

While the isolated infraction into the hollow system was not relevant in smaller tumours, it implies an additional prognostically negative factor in advanced tumours. In the same measure the invasion of renal capsule or perihilary tissue resulted in a prognostically negative factor. Invasion of blood or lymphatic vessels proved to be very bad prognostically and resulted in a decrease of the survival rate of about 2/3.

Recently a 2- to 3-fold increase in the number of glucocorticoid receptors in human peripheral lymphocytes has been noted after in vitro mitogen stimulation. Here, we extend these observations to in vivo immunization. After unilateral immunization of adrenalectomized male rats, a 50% increase in glucocorticoid receptor sites per cell, determined by binding of dexamethasone, was observed in cell suspensions of homolateral lymph nodes over those from the contralateral nonimmunized side of the same animal. The association constant for dexamethasone was similar in both groups, as was the stereospecificity for various steroids, the time course of cytoplasmic and nuclear association, and cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation. Despite a 50% increase in the number of glucocorticoid receptor sites per cell, the cells from the homolateral and controlateral lymph nodes were equally sensitive to the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone, as determined by measurements of the incorporation of radiolabeled precursors of protein, RNA, and DNA, or measurements of in vitro cell survival.",Immunology

In the present study we examined the effects of L-thyroxine on the differentiation of three sexually dimorphic organs in mice affected by the testicular feminization mutation (Tfm): the submaxillary salivary glands, the kidneys, and the adrenal glands. In the salivary gland we compared the effects of L-thyroxine and testosterone in normal and Tfm mice on the morphology of the intercalated tubules and on the NGF content of this gland. In the kidney we examined thyroid hormone effects on the sexually dimorphic proximal convoluted tubules. In the adrenal gland we studied the effects of the same hormone on the weight of the organ and on the structure and ultrastructure of the zona reticularis in untreated and L-thyroxine treated Tfm mice. The results show that the thyroid hormone enhances differentiation of the dimorphic structures in all these organs and increases the secretory activity of the salivary and adrenal glands. The stimulatory effects of L-thyroxine are more pronounced on the weight of the adrenal than of the salivary gland and of the kidney. Our results raise the question whether the enhanced differentiation elicited by L-thyroxine in the three sexually dimorphic organs of Tfm mutants is due to a direct hormonal effect, or whether it is fully, or in part, mediated through the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis.",Immunology

Autonomic effects of beta-bungarotoxin (beta-BuTX), a presynaptic blocking agent at the neuromuscular junction, were examined with parasympathetic (vagus), sympathetic nerve-atrial preparations isolated from guinea pigs. beta-BuTX in concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 10 micrograms/ml abolished the negative inotropic and chronotropic responses to electrical stimulation of the preganglionic trunks of the vagus nerve. This effect was time- and dose-related and was not restored by repeated washings. Such blocking action of beta-BuTX was also obtained when post-ganglionic stimulation was applied. On the other hand, beta-BuTX failed to block the positive inotropic and chronotropic responses to either pre- or postganglionic sympathetic nerve stimulation. The nicotine-induced negative, then positive inotropic and chronotropic effects, under nerve conduction block with tetrodotoxin, were little affected with the application of beta-BuTX. The negative or positive responses to exogenously applied acetylcholine or norepinephrine were also unaffected by beta-BuTX. Thus, beta-BuTX apparently blocks cholinergic transmission in the vagus nerve innervating the guinea-pig heart, probably by acting on the postganglionic nerve terminals, yet does not interfere with preganglionic cholinergic and postganglionic adrenergic transmissions in the sympathetic nerves.",Immunology

Oxytocin (OT) release from the maternal posterior pituitary gland has been implicated in the process of spontaneous labor.

Administration of dopamine (DA), 150 mg/kg/ui hr, or L-dopa, 200 mg/kg/12 hr, plus carbidopa, 20 mg/kg/12 hr, to pregnant rats beginning on day 16 of gestation delayed the mean delivery time by 10 to 18 hr. These drug treatments also inhibited the release of OT from fetal pituitary glands which normally occurred during parturition. Release of OT from maternal pituitary glands was not affected and no alterations in the duration or outcome of labor were noted. Administration of [3H]DA to pregnant rats resulted in higher amounts of labeled DA in fetal brain tissues than in maternal brain. These studies suggest that fetal OT is involved in the timing of parturition in the rat and that DA may prolong gestation by affecting fetal OT.",Immunology

The temporal course of orally and parenterally administered beta-methyldigoxin and orally administered digoxin was studied in a series of twenty patients who suffered from congestive heart failure due to a variety of causes. The parameters studied mainly were systolic time intervals. The incontrovertible conclusion was that beta-methyldigoxin acts almost immediately when administered intravenously and after 20 minutes when given by mouth. The peak action, however, by either route of administration was evident at the end of 45 minutes. Viewed in comparison, digoxin after oral administration acted after 2 hours, reaching its peak action after 8 hours. It must be admitted, however, that the magnitude of the response to both drugs, as measured by significant reduction in PEP/LVET ratio and increase in ejection fraction, was the same. Our study suggests that beta-methyldigoxin is as effective an inotropic agent as digoxin, with an additional characteristic of total and rapid gastrointestinal absorption, predictable and rapid onset and much shorter time interval for its peak action.",Immunology

Human language consists of some strata. The deepest one is the pongid stratum represented by a rest of emotionally used clicks in standard languages but well developed and enlarged in the archaic Bushman language. Each baby produces the labial click which is an instinctive phoneme resulting from the sucking movement and other clicks follow (see text). The second stratum in all languages is given by the system of the global words as mama, papa, dada which have no meaning at first so that mama gets in some languages the meaning ""mother"" but ""father"" in some others. A third old stratum is represented by a set of about 300 words (so-called elementary parallels) which are the same in nearly all languages, for example kap ""to seize, to grasp, to grip"". Furthermore, some notes ae made of the hypothesis given by Jonas and Jonas that in prehistoric tomes the female sex in creating of human language predominated.",Immunology

After an initial 4-week baseline phase, during which daily records of headache activity and medication were kept, 24 migraine patients were randomly assigned to one of the four experimental conditions. Training sessions for all patients were of 50-min duration and occurred once per week for 8 weeks. The headache charts were completed for another 4 weeks after treatment was terminated and again at 6-month follow-up. The results showed significant reductions in migraine activity and drug usage. However, self-regulation of skin temperature in different directions at different sites did not in fact result in significantly different magnitudes of change in migraine activity across groups.

The analysis considers the 14 BT-codes constituting the BT-sequence as being independent variables. Error rates of 6-8% in classification experiments and 3-4% in karyotyping experiments are clearly smaller than those reported by other authors using other methods. If the error rates of karyotyping are adjusted for errors in the basic material, they are reduced to 2-3%. The reason for the small error rate is presumably that the BT-sequences are superior to other methods for condensed band-pattern description.

The cytokinetic response of the solid Yoshida sarcoma to hyperthermia was examined at two tumour volumes, 1.0-1.5 ml and 3.0-3.5 ml. The tumour, growing on the feet of rats, was heated at 42 degrees C for 1 h by water-bath immersion. The larger tumour grew more slowly than the smaller one (doubling time 144 h vs 36 h) due to a halving in growth fraction from 67.8 to 39.6% and an increase in cell-loss factor from 59 to 75.9%. Cell cycle and phase times were similar at both volumes. The effect of heat on the population kinetics at both volumes was similar but complex, and involved delayed cell death after up to 10 mitoses. Initial cell killing and blockade of cell-cycle progression (0-24 h) was followed by recovery of proliferation due to recruitment of cells from the non-proliferative compartment, cell cycle and phase times remaining unaltered. From 48 h, the proliferation rate declined progressively, and tumours were completely necrotic 7-8 days after heat. The damaging effects of heat were at least as severe in the large tumours with a low labelling index and small growth fraction as in the smaller tumours with a much larger compartment of proliferating cells and shorter doubling time. The results imply that there may be no simple relationship between proliferative status and thermosensitivity of a tumour, and illustrate the difficulty in predicting tumour response to heat on the basis of cytokinetic studies.",Immunology

The effects of infusion of potassium chloride was studied in Wistar rats given lithium by the food for more than 3 weeks. The animals were anaesthetized with amytal and three clearance periods were run. During periods 1 and 3 0.15 M NcCl was infused at a rate of 0.02 ml/min. for 60 min. and in period 2 0.5 M KCl was infused at the same rate for 90 min. Potassium infusion led to an increase of potassium excretion. Sodium excretion and urine flow were positive linear correlated to the potassium excretion but in rats given lithium the effect of potassium on sodium excretion was about eight times higher and the effect on urine flow about thirteen times higher than the effects on control rats not given lithium.

Observation on radiation-induced heart injuries following a single dose of x-ray irradiation to rabbit heart with special reference to its pathogenesis. Radiation-induced heart injuries were morphologically studied by using the rabbits irradiated with a single dose of 3,000R (group I) or 300R of X-ray group II) from 1 hour until 6 months. There was no essential difference in the lesions of the hearts from group I and that of group II. Acute epicarditis was found as early as 1 hour after irradiation and it became maximum in severity at 1-2 days. In the myocardium, there were degeneration and resolution of the myocardial cell, various architectural changes of mitochondria, and disorganization of the intercalated disc. Polymorphonuclear cell infiltration and endothelial injuries of the capillaries occurred in the interstitial tissue. In addition, endocarditis with or without thrombus formation was often found. Acute inflammation was seen in the myocardium of group II rather later than that of group I, but it disappeared earlier. In the later stage, fibrosis finally occurred in the epicardium and endocardium. Glycoprotein degeneration of the muscle cells and fibrosis appeared in the myocardium. The pathogenesis of radiation pancarditis is thought to be dependent not only on the disturbance of microcirculation caused by endothelial cell damage of the capillaries, but also on alterations of the myocardial mitochondria as a result of direct injury.",Immunology
7361549,"Acute methyl mercury intoxication in mice--effect on the immune system. Effect of organic mercury on the immune system was studied in experimental acute methyl mercury intoxication in mice. After 7 daily injections of methyl mercury hydroxide, marked atrophy of the thymic cortex and splenic lymphoid follicles were observed, associated with decrease of PHA- and LPS-responsiveness of splenic lymphocytes as well as conversely increased both PHA- and LPS-responsiveness of thymocytes. In addition, apparent decrease of antibody formation against sheep red blood cells was observed at 7 day after the last injection. However, all these changes restored to normal level within 4 weeks after the last injection. Histochemically, mercury deposits were massively found in the renal tubules and slightly in macrophages throughout the body at 7 day after the last injection. The mercury deposits in macrophages of the thymus, lymph nodes and liver increased in concentration thereafter, with concomitant decrease of those in renal tubules. Presence of mercury element in these deposits was confirmed by electron probe analysis. It was suggested that the organic mercury gave direct cytotoxic effect on lymphocytes, but the effect appeared to be soon detoxicated by macrophages.",Immunology

Two cases are presented which illustrate some of the benefits and limitations of hypnosis in pain management. Hypnosis is most effective when the patient is motivated, and pain is a strong motivating force. Secondary gain from the pain and underlying psychiatric illness must be considered when seemingly routine pain problems do not respond to hypnosis. Hypnosis may be equally effective for pain of organic or psychogenic origin. Ancillary benefits from hypnosis may include a diminution of secondary anxiety and depression. The technic is impractical for some patients because of the time requirements, but proper patient selection can obviate much of this objection. Self-hypnosis and/or the supervised use of a relative as a substitute for the physician enhances effectiveness.

The patients were found to have low physical work capacity that averaged 51.6 +/- 3.8 (SE)% predialysis and 50.3 +/- 3.7% postdialysis, when compared with the physical work capacity of healthy control subjects. The exercise was stopped when patients complained of muscular fatigue, and the work load at this point was considered their subjective maximal work capacity. At this stage the patients had high blood lactic acid levels and an increased double product (systolic blood pressure x heart rate), the latter indicating a high stage of cardiac output. The oxygen consumption and oxygen pulse were similar to those obtained from control individuals at the same work load. This study suggests that limited physical work capacity of chronic hemodialysis patients is due to early muscular fatigue.

All four treatments caused stunting during the litter period, but only the first two were associated with reduced weights at the time of testing. Deficits in visual discrimination were most severe in males and females with intergenerational malnutrition. Both large-litter rearing and protein deficiency for one generation impaired visual discrimination in males only, whereas rotation between lactating and non-lactating females did not reduce visual discrimination in either gender.

The effect of intraluminal pH on the gastrin response to sham feeding was studied in healthy subjects. Before, during, and after sham feeding, an acidified solution of saline (at either pH 5.0 or 2.5) was infused into the stomach continuously and intragastric pH was maintained at either 5.0 or 2.5 by in vivo intragastric titration. When intragastric pH was maintained at 5.0, vagal stimulation induced by sham feeding released statistically significant amounts of gastrin. Acidification to pH 2.5 abolished the gastrin response and also inhibited by approximately 50% the acid secretory response to sham feeding. A small dose of atropine (2.3 micrograms/kg) prevented the inhibition of gastrin release which had occurred at pH 2.5. Moreover, in the presence of atropine, acidification to pH 2.5 did not inhibit acid secretion stimulated by sham feeding. These findings suggest that acid inhibition of sham feeding-stimulated gastrin release and gastric acid secretion is mediated by an atropine-sensitive pathway.",Immunology

This paper presents a mathematical mechanism for neuronal synchronization in oscillatory brain activities on the basis of the layer structures with recurrent inhibition. To begin with, a linear theory reveals that the recurrent inhibition tends to cause a synchronous uniform oscillation if the loop delay increases, and that an oscillating neuron recruits neighboring neurons by delivering synchronous inputs through the recurrent inhibition loop if the frequency is that of the selfexcitatory oscillation. Then, a quasilinearized dual wave model (DWM), employing the two-sinusoids plus bias input describing functions (TSBDF), shows the competitive relationship between the synchronous oscillation and a spatial wave that is introduced to represent normal brain activity patterns. Results of computer simulations conform well to the predictions of the DWM. Thus, synchronous brain activities are suggested to be the result of the spatio-temporal filter characteristics of the brain layer structures, modified by the neural nonlinearity.",Immunology

Whenever abdominal circulatory disorders are caused by obstruction of the abdominal aortic visceral branches, adequate blood flow may be restored only by surgical intervention.

When performed through smaller tubes, pressures exceeding ventilator limits may occur, alveolar ventilation may become impaired, or progressive hyperinflation from airway obstruction during expiration may result. In this study, the efficacy of a 70% helium-30% oxygen ventilating gas mixture was compared to 30% oxygen in air in a laboratory mechanical lung analog and during 15 bronchoscopies in 7 intubated patients. One patient with a 7.5 mm tube was studied. With the helium-oxygen mixture, ventilator pressures were not exceeded, alveolar ventilation was uncompromised, and hyperinflation did not occur.

A model of ""reflection"" was developed in a sucrose gap preparation of Purkinje fibers. In this preparation, a driven impulse on the proximal side of a sucrose gap is electrotonically transmitted after a delay to the tissue distal to the gap. When the delay is long enough, electrotonic transmission in the reverse direction over the same blocked segment can reexcite the proximal segment. Frequency-dependent alterations of patterns of ectopic activity were qualitatively similar to those of a parasystolic model and to those described in previous in vivo demonstrations presumed to represent circus movement reentry. Moderate changes of frequency or in the degree of block were shown to convert a manifest bigeminal rhythm to a trigeminal or more complex rhythm with or without intervening periods of silence. Our observations suggest that reflection and parasystolic pacemaker activity are examples of a continuous spectrum of ectopic impulse generation.",Immunology

All these patients showed elevation in the urinary enzyme activity over that given by healthy controls. Bilharzial and nonbilharzial bladder cancer patients exhibited significant increase in urinary enzyme activity as compared with corresponding groups with benign urologic diseases A level of 50 units of enzyme activity was taken as a limit to discriminate between bladder cancer patients and those patients with benign urologic diseases. The specificity and sensitivity of this urinary test exceeded 90% with low falsely positive and negative results. The data of the present study recommended the use of urinary alpha-naphthyl acetate esterases activity as a preliminary screening test for bilharzial and nonbilharzial bladder cancer patients.,Immunology

7349638,"Nature of the erythropoietin-independent response of CFU-S to steroids. Testosterone given in vivo or in vitro triggers the pluripotent stem cell of bone marrow (CFU-S) into S-phase of the cell cycle. This action of testosterone raises many questions with regard to the cellular mechanisms utilized by testosterone for its cell-cycle effect. The extent to which triggering is coupled to the androgenic activity of this steroid or to the presence of erythropoietin is also of importance. In vitro studies in a system free of serum or plasma, steroid structure activity studies, use of the Tfm mutant system and the application of a unique steroid (batrachotoxin) and one of its antagonists (tetrodotoxin) to the CFU-S system have served to answer some of these questions. Results suggest that the cell cycle action of many steroids is erythropoietin independent, does not utilize androgen binding receptors, and does not utilize cyclase systems. Studies with batrachotoxin suggest that steroids may trigger CFU-S into S-phase by an effect upon ion conductance mechanisms at the level of the cell membrane.",Immunology

The question of how older lawyers function in the context of what is generally a high stress occupation is examined from data drawn from a random stratified sample of 130 members of the legal profession. It is shown that elderly lawyers are able to reduce work stress (largely deriving from volume, responsibility, clients, and trials) by control over the quantity and focus of their work, as well as through client selection. Elderly lawyers are able to create a relatively stress free work role, which is in fact a functional niche for them within the profession. The result is high job satisfaction and low rates of retirement among elderly practitioners. Two factors: work role compensation and work role autonomy, are isolated from the legal data and proposed as important variables in a general theory of retirement behavior.",Immunology

Autografts of pericardium were inserted as patches into incisions across the annulus of the pulmonary valve in 12 adult dogs and 12 pups. In order to accommodate for possible effects of pulmonary hypertension which pertains in many clinical circumstances, constricting teflon bands were placed around the main pulmonary artery in half of the animals. Samples of tissue from the patches were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy from 6 to 14 mth later. The eventual thickness of the insertion site of the patches was found to become 2-14 times greater than the initial autograft due to apposition of layers of collagenous tissue on the endocardial and epicardial surfaces of the autografts. Three pups showed small, angiographically undetected central aneurysms in their patches but the tissue in their base was 5 or more times thicker than control pericardium. Cartilaginous metaplasia was evident at the margins of 57% of the patches, necrotic remnants of parts of the autograft were evident in 38% and foci of dystrophic calcification in 24% of them. Whereas smooth muscle cells sometimes extended into the repair tissue (19%), elastic fibres were not present in the patches.

Neostigmine, 1 micro M, by itself and in the presence of 0.1 micro M phentolamine potentiated responses. In the presence of 3 micro M phentolamine neostigmine restored responses to 1-20 HZ. Atropine, 1 micro M by itself, in the presence of neostigmine (1 micro M), and in the presence of neostigmine and phentolamine (0.1 micro M) inhibited the response. Hexamethonium, 100 micro M, had no effect on responses to field stimulation or to exogenously applied (-)-noradrenaline. Responses to (-)-noradrenaline were not altered by neostigmine or atropine.

The calculated regional hepatic blood flow values were displayed as a color images in eight color steps. Eleven patients with and without liver diseases were studied. In all the patients studied, heterogeneous intrahepatic distribution of blood flow was clearly demonstrated by the functional image of regional hepatic blood flow. Although a consistent pattern of intrahepatic distribution of blood flow was not obtained, greater-flow regions were frequently observed in the right lobe. Repeat studies in two patients demonstrated that the intrahepatic distribution of blood flow varied. The 10-15 s scintiphotosplenoportograms also showed the existence of restricted or preferential intrahepatic distribution of splenic flow.

To measure the extent of disagreement on roles between nurse practitioners (NPs) and physicians working together and to look for characteristics of joint practices that are associated with disagreement, patient vignettes were sent to 15 NP/M.D. dyads, and both M.D.s and NPs were asked how appropriate it would be for them and for their co-practitioner to provide care for the problem presented in each vignette. Measures of disagreement on patient care roles were developed by comparing responses within the dyad. For all practices, there was moderate agreement on roles, and this agreement seemed to favor a complementary practice. Disagreement on the NP's role was most often in the direction of NP feeling capable of providing more care than the M.D. felt she could provide. Various factors, such as job satisfaction, age differences between providers, and training level of the NP, were associated with the disagreement that was found. Some disagreement on roles exists between NPs and M.D.s practicing together. Resolution of these differences may lead to greater job satisfaction and more effective interaction between providers.",Immunology

The umbilical uptakes of oxygen and glucose are approximately 55 and 28%, respectively, of the total uterine uptake. This discrepancy between uterine and umbilical uptakes is due primarily to a large utilization rate of oxygen and glucose by the placenta. Part of the placental utilization of glucose can be accounted for by placental lactate excretion into both maternal and fetal blood. In marked contrast to the pattern of glucose utilization, the comparison of uterine and umbilical amino acid uptakes shows that the bulk of the amino acids taken up by the pregnant uterus is transferred to the fetus.

Incomplete cytokinesis followed by the disappearance of the midbody and spindle remnant results in intercellular bridges between the cells of the blastoderm of the squid embryo. An electron microscope study of the morphology of the stages of development of the intercellular bridge is presented. Cytokinesis ceased as the furrow base reached a diameter slightly larger than the midbody. As furrowing stopped, a dense material accumulated to form a cylindrical sheath 50 nm thick, lining the inner surface of the furrow base. Proteolytic enzymes showed this material to have a significant protein component. As the midbody broke down, vesicles lined the inner surface of the bridge sheath. In this configuration, there was cytoplasmic continuity between the cells, and organelles appeared to pass through the bridge. The intercellular bridge could become temporarily closed. Vesicles entered the channel and fused with the vesicles lining the inner surface of the sheath. The vesicles enlarged until the channel became occluded with a series of transverse cisternae, the edges of which were embedded in the material of the sheath. When the bridge reopened, the transverse cisterna appeared to dissociate from the sheath, move out of the channel, and break down. Occasionally bridges were seen in which the bridge wall appeared distorted into lobes. It is suggested that such bridges might be in the process of breaking down, resulting in the final separation of the cells.",Immunology

TPR progressively increased to 6225 +/- 749 by 5 hours. Plasma glucose did not significantly differ from control values (105 +/- 4 mg%) for the first 90 min but then declined to 68 +/- 6 mg% at 4.5 hours. (TMC = 103 +/- 17, P less than 0.05).

It is hypothesized that ES results in a circle of positive feedback initiated by an increase in TPR and subsequent decrease in flow resulting in hepato-pancreatic ischemia.

This investigation reports the effect of age (3, 6, 12, 24 and 28 months) on the concentrations of magnesium, calcium, zinc, copper and iron in renal homogenates of Fischer 344 strain rats. Samples of renal tissues were homogenized in a solution containing 5 p. 100 La + 25 p. 100 HNO3. The samples were digested, centrifuged and assayed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. With age, the magnesium concentration decreased (P less than 0.05) while the calcium and copper concentrations remained unchanged, and the zinc concentration decreased slightly while the iron concentration markedly increased (P less than 0.05). In summary, these data and other data obtained from similar studies of the brain and heart, suggest that the changes observed with age are unique to the kidney. Our results suggest that changes in ionic concentration in the kidney with respect to age could contribute to the diminished function observed in that organ with senescence.",Immunology

Our studies on the mechanism of the inhibition of that enzyme have led to the demonstration that a ternary covalent complex of enzyme, inhibitor, and cofactor is formed that results in essentially irreversible inhibition. The nature of this ternary complex has enabled us to devise ultrasensitive competitive ligand binding assays for thymidylate synthetase, FdUMP, and dUMP, the substrate of the enzyme. These determinants will be studied in needle biopsy specimens obtained from cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy with 5-FU in a prospective clinical investigation.",Immunology

7344421,"Role of limbic structures in individual characteristics of behavior. The dogs with more frequent hippocampal theta-rhythm develop transswitching of food and defensive instrumental conditioned reflexes more rapidly and easily. Bilateral destructions of frontal regions of the neocortex and hippocampus in rats increased their reactivity to the aversive stimuli (intensive light and sound) and simultaneously decreased their sensitivity to the signals of defensive excitation ill the other animal. Bilateral damages of lateral and ventromedial hypothalamus equally increased the reactivity of rats to sound, light and cry of the partner. Confrontation of these results with the data obtained previously and those available in literature leads to the conclusion that individual features in the relation of ""information system"" (frontal neocortex and hippocampus) to ""motivation system"" (amygdala and hypothalamus) lie at the root of the extra-intraversion parameter. The relationship of the ""frontal neocortex  hypothalamus"" and ""hippocampus  amygdala"" systems is reflected in the scale of neurotism (emotionality).

A total of 194 children of epileptic mothers and 71 children of epileptic fathers were examined for mental retardation, neurologic disturbances, major malformations, and acrofacial dysmorphias typical for hydantoin-barbiturate embryopathy (HB-E). HB-E was observed in nearly 7% of the children of mothers on anticonvulsants during pregnancy. Barbiturates and/or primidone were observed to induce the same dysmorphic features as hydantoins. The teratogenic potential of hydantoins may be slightly increased in combination with barbiturates/primidone. Neither the 71 children of epileptic fathers nor the 46 children of epileptic mothers without anticonvulsants exhibited symptoms of HB-E. The frequency of major, unspecific malformations was increased in children of epileptic mothers as well as in children of epileptic fathers as compared with the general population. Cerebral disturbances without dysmorphias were increased in children of mothers with and without anticonvulsants, but this was rarely the case in children of epileptic fathers.

In contrast, no aggregate formation occurred when autologous cord serum was added to mixtures containing cord red cells and sheep red cells. Heat inactivation of the adult serum or the presence of 0.15 M EDTA prevented the formation of mixed aggregates. These observations indicated that the mixed aggregates occurred through the complement-dependent red cell immune adherence (RCIA) phenomenon. The addition of untreated cord serum to mixtures containing inactivated adult serum restored the formation of mixed aggregates, indicating that the cord serum contained sufficient complement for RCIA. Natural antibody against sheep red cells was present in adult sera but was absent in cord sera.

The sample consists of 981 Guatemala City children, 7.00 to 13.99 years old. Of high and low socioeconomic status (SES). High SES children have larger median values for triceps skinfold, subscapular skinfold, arm circumference, and estimated mid-arm muscle and fat areas than low SES children. Compared with children of a US reference sample, the high SES children generally have larger values for all variables and the low SES children have smaller values. However, the differences between the low SES children and the children of the other two samples are greater for arm fat area than for arm muscle area. The analysis suggests that low SES Guatemalan children suffer to a greater extent from chronic energy, rather than protein, undernutrition. A similar pattern of energy malnutrition has been observed for rural Guatemalan children. These combined data suggest that estimates of fat reserves of the arm provide a useful indication of nutritional status for Third-World children. Results from rural Costa Rican and Honduran studies have been taken to mean that muscle reserves are better than fat reserves as indicators of nutritional status in developing countries. But, those studies did not estimate cross-sectional muscle and fat areas and only considered the extremes of the population distribution for muscle and fat.",Immunology

Graft size was assessed angiographically in representative dogs of each group prior to sacrifice. Initial examination of the retrieved specimens revealed pannus extensions at both anastomoses on all graft types, and a variable midgraft appearance from smooth and glistening to partially thrombus coated. Histological assessment of graft segments revealed widely differing healing responses on the three graft types. Tissue attachment to both graft surfaces and varying degrees of tissue incorporation were observed in the Vasculour D and Gore-Tex prostheses. The Solco-graft specimens showed no evidence of tissue incorporation of the wall at two months. Tissue on the graft surfaces remains loosely attached and unincorporated. Pannus extensions were thickest on the Solco-graft. Variably thin fibrin is scattered over the luminal surface of the three graft types. Vascularization of the wall particularly the internal capsulae was noted in the Vasculour D grafts. Although biological responses in the dog are difficult to extrapolate to man, the types of comparison testing allowed by the use of the thoraco-abdominal by-pass procedure can provide valuable information of degree of dilation, relative tissue attachment, tissue incorporation into various types of prostheses and kidney infarcts study.

Overall, subjects gave relatively valid self-reports, and when answers were invalid they were more often overreported than underreported.

The validity of subjects' answers was not differentially affected by whether they answered the questions themselves or were interviewed by an experimenter. While subjects who were interviewed individually gave significantly more valid responses to questions than subjects interviewed in a group setting, the difference (5%) was not great.

Fifty patients with fibrosing alveolitis studied on 104 occasions exhibited significant direct correlations between vital capacity (VC), maximum mid-expiratory flow rate (MMFR), and transfer factor for carbon monoxide (TLCO). Forced expired volume in the first second (FEV1)/VC ratio bore a weak negative correlation with VC. Peak expiratory flow, MMFR, and maximum flow rates at 50% and 25% of VC were often reduced in patients with severe grades of pulmonary dysfunction. It appears that as the severity of the fibrotic process increases, the lung volumes shrink and the transfer factor for CO decreases. The total lung capacity decreases predominantly on account of reduction in VC. With a decrease in lung volume the MMFR also falls. Decrease in flow rates at low lung volumes is greater as compared to the fall in peak flow. The expiratory flow rates however were normal or even increased when related to absolute lung volume. Some patients exhibit disproportionate expiratory slowing as evidenced by a decrease in MMFR which is out of proportion to the reduction in VC. These patients also have a reduced FEV1/VC ratio.

A field strength dependent increase in the amplitude of the T-wave signal in the rat electrocardiogram (ECG) was observed during exposure to homogeneous, stationary magnetic fields. For 24 adult Sprague-Dawley and Buffalo rats of both sexes, the T-wave amplitude was found to increase by an average of 408% in a 2.0 Tesla (1 Tesla - 10(4) Gauss) field. No significant magnetically induced changes were observed in other components of the ECG record, including the P wave and the QRS complex. The minimum field level at which augmentation of the T wave could be detected was 0.3 Tesla. The magnetically induced increase in T-wave amplitude occurred instantaneously, and was immediately reversible after exposure to fields as high as 2.0 Tesla. No abnormalities in any component of the ECG record, including the T wave, were noted during a period of 3 weeks following cessation of a continuous 5-h exposure of rats to a 1.5-Tesla field. The heart rate and breathing rate of adult rats were not altered during, or subsequent to, application of fields up to 2.0 Tesla. The effect of animal orientation within the field was tested using juvenile rats 3-14 days old. The maximum increase in T-wave amplitude was observed when subjects were placed with the long axis of the body perpendicular to the lines of magnetic induction. These experimental observations, as well as theoretical considerations, suggest that augmentation of the signal amplitude in the T-wave segment of the ECG may result from a superimposed electrical potential generated by aortic blood flow in the presence of a stationary magnetic field.",Immunology

Experimental evidence indicates that Ehrlich ascites tumor cells resistant to daunorubicin (DNR) have a higher active drug extrusion than do wild-type cells. In the present study, the possibility of circumventing this mechanism of resistance by addition of an analog of DNR, N-acetyldaunorubicin (N-acetyl-DNR), was investigated in vitro and in vivo. The affinity of N-acetyl-DNR was 7 times lower than that of DNR in the lysates of both wild-type and resistant cells. In agreement with this finding, N-acetyl-DNR reduced the binding of [3H]DNR to lysate from the two cell lines only to a minor extent. On the other hand, N-acetyl-DNR exerted a marked inhibition on both the active efflux and the unidirectional influx of [3H]DNR in both cell lines. Within certain limits, addition of N-acetyl-DNR resulted in increased steady-state uptake of [3H]DNR; in wildtype cells, the maximal obtainable elevation was 18%, compared to 142% in resistant cells. In vivo addition of N-acetyl-DNR, even at 80 mg/kg for 4 consecutive days, did not influence the toxicity of DNR in mice. In a therapeutic experiment, addition of N-acetyl-DNR increased the antitumor activity of DNR upon the resistant tumor line significantly, but no change was observed in the wild-type tumor. These data indicate that N-acetyl-DNR or related analogs may be used as adjuvants to circumvent acquired resistance to DNR.",Immunology

A false-positive diagnosis of cholelithiasis was made in three patients, two of whom proved to have extensive cholesterolosis. Causes of false-negative studies were the presence of a single small calculus, obseity and a large distended gallbladder.

Common needs of families of acutely injured patients are the need to be with the patient, to learn about his condition, to feel useful, to express feeling about the situation, and to obtain emotional support. Besides addressing these needs, a family meeting can reduce family turmoil, help dispel family-staff conflict, and provide a format for educating staff about psychologic responses to life-threatening illness.

In contrast, pre-fusion mononucleated L8 cultured infected 24 h after plating were refractory to Coxsackievirus A2 infection, as was a non-fusing clonal variant of the L8 line (L8CL3-U) regardless of the age of the latter cultures. The development of virus susceptibility in the older L8 cultures correlated with a marked virus-specific c.p.e. as evidenced by vacuolated degenerating myotubes with disrupted cytoplasm, whereas no c.p.e. was seen following infection of the young L8 or variant L8CL3-U cultures.

Skin biopsies are routinely used to establish fibroblast cultures in vitro, but the ultrastructural properties of the cells during this outgrowth have not received much attention. In the present study, the rate and the nature of the outgrowth of skin biopsy explants were examined in a quantitative and qualitative fashion. Attention was particularly focused on the morphogenetic properties of the various cell types present in the initial outgrowth. The rate of success in obtaining an outgrowth from the explants was slightly dependent on the composition of the medium or the serum. In more than 95% of the cases an initial epithelial outgrowth was obtained. At a later stage the outgrowth became fibroblastic. Remarkable differences in the behavior and ultrastructural properties of epithelial and fibroblastic cells were observed. Incorporation of 3H-thymidine occurred almost simultaneously with the epithelial outgrowth but preceded the migration of the fibroblasts. Under scanning and transmission electron microscopy, the cells of the outermost layers of the epithelium remained flat and polygonal and were covered with small villi during migration. The cells were closely apposed. The germinative cells had a spiky surface and were separated by large intercellular spaces. No basal lamina was formed by the migrating cells. The fibroblasts maintained their shape and smooth surface and reached the substratum under the epithelial outgrowth. They accumulated microfilaments and microtubules in their cytoplasm and were characterized by surface-associated extracellular material. On the substratum, the fibroblasts spreadout. The behavior and ultrastructural properties of these fibroblasts resemble closely those observed on fibroblasts growing-out from aggregates.",Immunology

Eighty-seven patients with the clinical syndrome of infective endocarditis were examined by M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography. Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of echocardiographically detected vegetative lesions. Group 1 consisted of 47 patients with one or more vegetations. Group 2 consisted of 40 patients without evidence of vegetations. Group 1 patients had a higher rate of complications: emboli, congestive heart failure and the need for surgical intervention. Analysis of morphologic characteristics of the vegetations in group 1 was of no predictive value for complications in individual patients. Two-thirds of the vegetations persisted unaltered well beyond the period of bacteriologic cure without significant complications. No characteristic alteration of the vegetations predicted the efficacy of medical therapy. Although the detection of vegetations by echocardiography in patients with the clinical syndrome of endocarditis clearly identifies a subgroup at risk for complications, decisions regarding clinical management made solely on the basis of the presence or absence of vegetative lesions are hazardous. Management of such patients must continue to be based on the clinical integration of multiple factors.",Immunology

The content of total thiamine radioactivity in some nervous structures and liver of the rat was determined in a steady state condition, using [thiazole-2-14C]thiamine as a tracer. The contents were analyzed by a mamillary type compartmental model which enabled us to calculate the influx and efflux fractional rate constants, turnover times, turnover rates and relative accuracy. Total thiamine turnover rates of the central nervous system regions were found to be ordered in the following sequence: cerebellum (0.55 microgram/g.h) greater than medullar and pons greater than spinal cord and hypothalamus greater than midbrain (plus thalamic area) and corpus striatum greater than cerebral cortex (0.16 microgram/g.h). Sciatic nerve turnover rate was 0.58 microgram/g.h. The turnover times were mainly between 5 and 10 h (range 2.4--16.4 h). The influx rate constants could be ordered as follows: cerebellum greater than hypothalamus, pons and medulla greater than corpus striatum, spinal cord, midbrain (plus thalamic area) and sciatic nerve greater than cerebral cortex. The results show in general a good agreement between turnover rate values and brain regional sensitivity to thiamine deficiency, the most vulnerable areas to thiamine depletion being those with the highest turnover rates.",Immunology

To study the effect of prazosin therapy on left ventricular function in patients with chronic stable heart failure, first pass radionuclide angiography at rest and during exercise was performed in 15 patients before the administration of prazosin and after seven to 12 weeks of prazosin therapy. There was no significant change in resting ejection fraction before and during prazosin therapy (36 +/- 14 per cent versus 37 +/- 14 per cent) (mean +/- standard deviation). However, exercise ejection fraction increased from 34 +/- 14 per cent to 42 +/- 17 per cent (p less than 0.01). The difference in ejection fraction from rest to exercise (ejection fraction response) changed significantly from -2 +/- 6 per cent before prazosin therapy to +5 +/- 7 per cent during prazosin therapy (p less than 0.01). Exercise duration increased from 368 +/- 82 seconds to 476 +/- 82 seconds (p less than 0.01). Total work capacity measured in kilojoules increased from 12.6 +/- 8.3 to 18.6 +/- 10.4 (p less than 0.01). The improved ejection fraction response during prazosin therapy correlated with the improved work capacity (r = 0.69, p less than 0.01) and exercise duration (p = 0.59, p less than 0.05). This improvement occurred despite a significant weight gain with prazosin from 72.2 +/- 20.8 kg to 73.5 +/- 20.8 kg (p less than 0.01). These data suggest that long-term prazosin therapy is effective in the treatment of heart failure.

The rate of urinary zinc excretion was not different from that of the controls, with the exception of patients whose disease was in the polyuric phase of beginning remission where it was fivefold higher and those who had achieved a long-lasting remission of the disease. Since about two thirds of the plasma zinc is bound to albumin, an unchanged zinc-albumin ratio would reflect an equal zinc and albumin loss. The ratio, however, was increased twofold and thus does not adequately explain the hypozincemia.

Data regarding the relationship between patterns of alcohol use and illicit drug use in a population of 1473 teenagers interviewed in a northwestern metropolitan community indicate that : (1) regardless of the dimensions incorporated into four different indices of drug involvement examined, intercorrelations between indices were strong; (2) although the correlations between indices of drug involvement and overall levels of alcohol intake were uniformly weak, it was shown that levels of drug involvement vary directly with the maximum volume of alcohol used.

This problem can be minimized if 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA) is added to the charcoal solution prior to use.",Immunology

Placentas either in situ or mechanically separated from their uterine beds were surveyed by scanning electron microscopy to determine the changing relationship of the placenta to its uterine bed with special reference to alteration in the decidual basalis accompanying parturition. At 13 days gestation the placenta is connected to the uterus by a short, broad decidual stalk which becomes longer and more constricted by term. The stalk is covered by a layer of squamous epithelium. Mechanical separation of the placenta and uterus in early gestation reveals that the entire decidual basalis of the decidual stalk is composed of large coarse fibers. As gestation progresses, a relatively smooth acellular capsule forms around the base of the placenta. However, the center of the decidua basalis, the core of the stalk, continues to be composed of large coarse fibers throughout gestation and appears to be the only region penetrated by maternal vessels.",Immunology

One hundred symptomatic patients were evaluated independently with upper gastrointestinal radiography and fiberoptic endoscopy, and the results were compared. Of the two endoscopists sequentially examining the same patient, one was informed of available clinical and radiographic details and the other was not. Knowledge of the x-ray examination by the informed endoscopist did not improve his accuracy. Each endoscopist made four errors of interpretation. The endoscopic and x-ray findings agreed in 46 of the 100 patients, most often (68%) in esophagus, least often (29%) in the stomach and half the time (45%) in the duodenum. Ulcer craters seen endoscopically were detected radiographically in 36% of patients. We conclude that: 1) knowledge of results of prior upper gastrointestinal radiography did not alter endoscopic results; 2) experienced endoscopists are accurate but make mistakes; and 3) endoscopic findings would have been unaltered had radiography not been performed.",Immunology

The biochemical changes in the articular cartilage of the femoral condyles and the patella were studied during the earliest stage of patello-femoral arthrosis, with particular reference to chondromalacia of the patella in the ""lateral hypertension syndrome"", with the object of comparing them with the results obtained by Boni et al. (1977) in the initial phases of experimental arthrosis induced in rabbits by means of vitamin A. The biochemical determinations were done on samples of cartilage removed at operation from the medial and lateral femoral condyles and the medial and lateral patellar articular facets in ten patients. The biopsy samples were fixed in 80% alcohol and dried in the oven at 50 degrees C for twenty-four hours. The hexosamine and hydroxyproline content was then determined. This investigation demonstrated significant biochemical changes in this syndrome in the four areas examined. The data obtained indicate that only the mucopolysaccharide component of the joint cartilage is involved at this stage. The most interesting finding was marked diminution in the galactosamine/glucosamine ratio, which was markedly diminished - the opposite of what occurs in established arthrosis. These data appear to be identical with those found in the early phases of vitamin A induced arthrosis in experimental rabbits. The diminution of hexosamine content and the diminished galactosamine/glucosamine ratio were more marked in the femoral condyles, which appeared to have few lesions macroscopically. These changes were also present in both articular facets of patella, but were less marked, probably because the degeneration was more advanced in those areas, thus more closely resembling frank arthrosis.",Immunology

A report is given on refractive changes (delta R) from age of 10 to 18 years. The 1979 follow-up comprises 137 persons who had earlier (around 1970) participated in a larger investigation into ophthalmic sequels to a low birth weight (n = 539). In general (127 out of 137), there is a shift towards lower dioptric values (increase in refraction). Seven remained static while three showed a slight decrease in refraction (0.25-0.5 D). Adult emme- and hypermetropia show a median delta R about 0.7 D (increase) during adolescence, against median values of 1.7 and 2.5 D in juvenile myopia, of ex-prematures and full-terms respectively. With a median delta R of 1.2 D, 'myopia of prematurity' occupies an intermediate position (21 eyes of 13 subjects). Except for this subgroups, there is no evidence that low birth weight has influenced refractive distribution. With a (planned) skewing towards myopia, the 1979-sample cannot be considered epidemiologically representative, as was the original 1970-material. Concerning the latter, the 18-year incidence of myopia is given as 17.6% for ex-prematures and 13.1% for fullterms (minimum figures, based on school medical records).",Immunology

The location of striated border cells versus non-striated border cells during enamel maturation in the rat incisor was studied by light microscopy. Serial cross sections of the lower incisors were examined from a segment of the incisor in sections which also included the first molar tooth. In the series recorded here every cross section showed both striated and non-striated border cells. A map showing the distribution of cells on the enamel surface, as plotted from their position in each of the cross sections, reveals that the non-striated border cells traverse the enamel as oblique bands. Between the narrow bands of non-striated border cells were wide bands of striated border cells. The non-striated border cells were joined at their basal nuclear poles by contacts which appeared to separate the lateral inter-ameloblast space from the space between the papillary-ridge cells. Neither the striated border cells nor the non-striated border cells went entirely to the edge of the enamel organs. The above pattern of striated border cells and non-striated border cells is regarded to be a manifestation of the cyclical activity of maturation ameloblasts.",Immunology

To test this possibility, the kinetics of appearance of lipoprotein particles in these elements was determined for isolated rat livers first depleted of particles and then perfused with free fatty acid to restore particles. The results show that elements of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum in the perisinusoidal cytoplasm acquire lipoprotein particles in advance of elements of the conventional Golgi apparatus and that the particles contained within the perisinusoidal elements of smooth endoplasmic reticulum are not products of endocytotic uptake of particles from the circulation.",Immunology
7326275,"Biofeedback of accommodation to reduce functional myopia. Functional myopia may be defined as the refractive condition of the eye due to spasm of the ciliary muscle. As a result of the ciliary muscle spasm, the crystalline lens becomes more convex, creating a myopic refractive condition. The normal increase and decrease in the refractive power of the crystalline lens is know as accommodation and is controlled by the autonomic nervous system innervation to the ciliary muscle. Previous studies have reported that voluntary control of accommodation is possible by biofeedback training (Cornsweet & Crane, 1973; Randle, 1970). The present research investigated the application of biofeedback control of accommodation to reduce functional myopia. A double-reversal, multiple-baseline design was used to conduct the experiment. The results revealed that the three adult male subjects achieved the preset criterion, a 1/2-diopter reduction from initial baseline to a subsequent baseline. Further analysis of the data revealed even greater changes between initial baseline and feedback periods. Although generalization to a nonexperimental environment was not trained, each subject showed a reduction in myopia and an increase in visual acuity. The results of the experiment clearly demonstrated that functional myopia is subject to voluntary control.",Immunology

Transmural electrical stimulation after Burn and Rand (1960) with a pair of platinum electrodes is applied at a distance of 1 cm proximally from the place of recording. The responses of the single-spike neurones and of the erratic burst-type neurones to transmural electrical stimulation (series of impulses with frequency 1-20 Hz, duration of impulses 0.1-0.5 ms and suprathreshold current intensity) depend on the background neuronal activity. Thus, in the case of weak activity, stimulation with a frequency of 1-8 Hz results in activation of both types of neurones. A particularly high neuronal activity, stimulation with the same frequency results in inhibition. Transmural electrical stimulation does not change the character of the activity of steady burst-type neurones.",Immunology

Tobramycin in combination with clindamycin or lincomycin were used as systemic antibiotics in the treatment of 20 consecutive patients with septic peritonitis or intraabdominal sepsis, 10 of which were in septic shock. Doses were: tobramycin 1.5 mg/kg body weight every 8 hours, with prolonged dosage interval in patients with reduced renal function, clindamycin 0.9 g every 8 hours and lincomycin 1.2 g every 8 hours. Therapy was monitored by means of tobramycin serum concentration determinations and renal function tests. Eventual cure of the infection was obtained in 19 patients. In 2 of these, the effects of the antibiotics were doubtful. Side effects were observed on 8 occasions: One patient had a slight and temporary subjective hearing loss, coinciding with raised trough levels of tobramycin. Diarrhoea occurred in 3 cases and skin reactions in 3 cases. Superinfection with Candida albicans fungemia occurred in one patient. From the overall results it is concluded that the antibiotic regimen is of value in serious life-threatening infections. Although the tobramycin dose was higher than customarily used in Scandinavia at the time, 0 hour and 1 hour serum concentrations remained stable during therapy in patients whose renal function was normal at onset of therapy. Serum creatinine (S-Cr) levels in these patients were also essentially unchanged. Temporary reductions in osmolality (Osm) ratio Osm-urine/Osm-serum occurred in 11 patients despite normal S-Cr, but it was hard to attribute these impairments of renal function to tobramycin specifically. It was also doubtful whether tobramycin further aggravated renal function in those patients where it was impaired at onset of therapy. Thus, no conclusive evidence of clinically important tobramycin-induced nephrotoxicity were found. We suggest that the dosage schedule of tobramycin used in this study is applied when treating serious intraabdominal infections.",Immunology

In patients with an ischemic lesion in the basin of the posterior cerebral arteries, the lesion localization and the preceding transitory cerebral circulation disturbances are usually not in agreement: the episodes are characterized by a considerable polymorphism and not infrequently point to a circulatory insufficiency in the arteries of the truncal or the carotid systems. the character, frequency, duration, and number of episodes are of no decisive diagnostic importance as regards the possibility of an ischemic stroke development.

A female newborn, the second child of healthy non consanguineous parents, exhibited muscular hypotonia, areflexia, apathy, seizures, hepatomegaly and failure to thrive since birth. The peculiar skull shape was lacking. In the urine pipecolic acid and trihydroxycoprostanoic acid were excreted. At the age of seven weeks she died of bronchopneumonia. Lightmicroscopy revealed malformations and deficiency of myelinisation in the brain, renal cysts and fatty metamorphosis in the enlarged liver, which showed only minimal siderosis. Ultrastructurally no peroxisomes could be found in liver and kidney. No peroxisomes were detected by histochemical demonstration of catalase in frozen liver tissue which was taken immediately after death and stored for three months. Absence of peroxisomes is pathognomonic for the cerebro-hepato-renal syndrome of Zellweger and occurs in the liver irrespective of duration and degree of liver damage. It is best demonstrated by enzymehistochemical electron microscopy. With this method peroxisomes can be visualized even 30 h post mortem. In deep frozen normal liver tissue the activity of catalase remains very stable and enables the identification of peroxisomes even after a 12 months period of storage. In the cerebro-hepato-renal syndrome of Zellweger, frozen liver tissue should be stored for biochemical and diagnostic enzymehistochemical studies.",Immunology

Cessation of stimulation was shown to lead to spontaneous recovery of EP, and the rate of its development depended on the number of stimuli applied in the habituation test. The use of repeated tests with constant intervals between them led to incomplete recovery of the amplitude of EP and to the more rapid development of habituation in subsequent tests (the habituation potentiation effect).

Epidermal nuclei and dermal nuclei were counted at both LRSP and at control points or HRSP. In addition, hair follicles, blood vessels, and sebaceous nuclei were likewise quantitated. This data, collected in a blind manner, was then subjected to statistical analysis using a nested analysis of variance and a Student's ""t"" test. The former test indicated an increase in density of hair follicles at LRSP, while both demonstrated a decrease in dermal nuclei at LRSP. An interesting finding is that the epidermis at both LRSP and HRSP is indistinguishable at the light microscopic level. This was indicated by both statistical procedures.

Ammonia (NH3/NH4+) caused relaxation of cerebrovascular smooth muscle which was transient and occurred irrespective of how the vessels were preconstricted (potassium-Krebs solution, noradrenaline, serotonin, prostaglandin F2 alpha). The effect was independent of ammonia-induced extracellular changes in pH. It is concluded that ammonia may contribute to the vasodilatation and increase in cerebral blood flow which occurs under certain pathophysiological conditions.",Immunology

With a view to estimating the character of the visual evoked potentials (EP) in the process of the formation of a temporal connection and its extinguishing in human subjects, temporal connection was created between two visual stimuli--non-verbal and verbal with neutral or emotional significance--in ten subjects with psychopathic traits of the character. Cerebral EP are recorded in the occipital, associative areas and on the vertex. In establishing the temporal relation, it was found that the non-verbal stimulus signalizing emotionally significant verbal stimulus causes a late positive component with shorter latency and higher amplitude in the occipital regions compared with EP of the non-verbal stimulus signalizing a neutral stimulus. Analogous differences are also found for the parameters of EP of the neutral and emotional verbal stimuli, i. e. the second stimulus in the pair. The established differences in the EP parameters of the two non-verbal signal stimuli during the functioning of the temporal connection are stable in character upon its extinguishing.U",Immunology

The relationship between interventricular septal (IVS) wall motion assessed by the echocardiogram and surface electrocardiogram was investigated in 11 patients (pts) with proximal left anterior descending coronary artery disease (LADd) during ergometer exercise. A specially devises transducer was used to obtain the echocardiograms. During exercise, 6 pts had transient ST segment depression (Group 1), whereas 5 pts had transient ST segment elevation (Group 2). During exercise-induced ischemia, the ST segment depression occurred prior to abnormal wall motion in Group 1, and lasted longer than the latter. On the other hand, the ST segment elevation was preceded by abnormal wall motion in Group 2, and returned to the control earlier than the latter. In conclusion, exercise echocardiography is useful to assess the relationship between interventricular wall dynamics and electrocardiographic changes during ischemia.",Immunology
7345115,"Intrapsychic effects of stigma: a process of breakdown and reconstruction of social reality. Being stigmatized has intrapsychic consequences for the individual. Two aspects of the process by which these consequences occur are described: a breakdown of the person's systems of interpretation and valuation, which may lead to reality shock; and a reconstruction of those systems that takes into account the stigmatized characteristic. The latter aspect is associated with frequently noted sequels to stigma, including identity reconstruction, changes in affiliative patterns, and revisions of long-range plans and goals. Key elements in both major aspects are the master-status character of stigma or, in other words, its being a status that takes precedence over all others; the widespread knowledge of stereotypes associated with a given stigma; and the actual and imagined responses of others. The data are from an ethnographic study of a homosexual community, but the intrapsychic processes described may occur in conjunction with any stigma acquired after normative socialization, including stigmas resulting from a characteristic viewed by others as inappropriate for a status occupied by the individual, such as a black or female professional.",Immunology

In both NIH and BALB/C mice the majority of the increased number of mast cells occurred within the intestinal epithelium. In NIH mice increase in the number of intestinal mast cells coincided roughly with expulsion of the parasites.

Membrane fraction containing halorhodopsin was prepared from the lysate of a mutant strain of Halobacterium halobium, Y1, which is defective in bacteriorhodopsin synthesis. 2. Irradiation of the membrane with red light at 0 degrees C decreased the absorbance intensities over the whole range of 500--600 nm and a new absorption peak appeared at about 400 nm. This process was reversed either by irradiation with blue light or simply by incubation in the dark. The wavelength at which the red light-induced absorbance decrease became maximum was 566 nm in the absence of NaCl and moved to 576 nm upon addition of NaCl. The midpoint for the conversion was at about 0.1 M NaCl. 3. Even though the membrane containing halorhodopsin was prepared in the absence of NaCl, this pigment was photochemically active in the sense that it could form a bathochromic photoproduct, a batho-intermediate, at -196 degrees C. 4.

This allows little scope for variation and thus diatoms from a very early geological period have retained basic morphological forms which arose during the original burst of evolution when the siliceous elements were in some way more plastic.

Three phenotypes can be distinquished: the ES-16A phenotype (IEP 5.9) was found in C57BL/10Sn and many other laboratory inbred strains; the ES-16B phenotype (IEP 6.1) was found in M. m. molossinus; and the ES-16C phenotype (IEP 5.9; very weak activity) was found in Peru-Coppock.

High enzyme multiplicity is also shown by the perineal and the anal glands. Some bands are, in several of these organs, under the control of testicular hormones.

Linkage between the HLA loci and a gene or genes which allow for the expression of clinical asthma could neither be proven nor disproven due to the small sample size. All of the asthmatic children had positive dilutional skin tests and RAST, suggesting that atopic asthma may be genetically controlled by the HLA chromosome (chromosome 6).

Since clavulanic acid had poor absorption (lambda max 201 nm in water) in a UV-region suitable for HPLC detection, the detectability was enhanced by bathochromic shift of lambda max due to solvent effect. The shifts of lambda max were measured with the solutions containing clavulanic acid, tetrabutylammonium bromide, and phosphate buffer salts in aqueous methanol. The magnitudes of the observed shifts were investigated with respect to pH, ionic strength, methanol content, and TBAB concentration. The results indicated that TBAB concentration was the predominant factor responsible for the bathochromic shifts. Taking account of the results together with solvent effects on the retention of clavulanic acid on hydrophobic stationary phase, HPLC condition suitable for detection and separation of clavulanic acid in urine was established as follows; mobile phase: 10 mM TBAB + 0.6 mM NaH2PO4 + 0.4 mM Na2HPO4 in H2O - MeOH, 10:1 (v/v)(pH 7.02), flow rate: 1.5 ml/minute, stationary phase: LiChrosorb RP-18 (25 cm x 4.6 mm i.d.), detection: UV 220 nm. The applicability of the present method is demonstrated by determining the time course of urinary excretion of clavulanic acid after oral administration of a conjugated tablet of clavulanic acid and amoxicillin to human subject.",Immunology
7327153,"[Schizophrenic psychoses and HLA antigens. Personal data and review of the literature]. Genetic factors play probably an important part in the development of schizophrenic psychoses. As a consequence the use of a genetic marker as the HLA system appears to be interesting in determining the disease susceptibility gene of these psychoses. Methods and results of an investigation about the frequencies of 33 HLA alleles observed in 51 patients considered as paranoid schizophrenics are presented. The frequency of HLA-A 29 was diminished while the one of HLA-B 15 was increased but the differences were no longer significant when p was corrected. However when all the results published from 1974 to 1980 were pooled in a combined statistical analysis, some associations became significant. It seems that schizophrenia as a whole, once paranoid and hebephrenic sub-types have to be distinguished. It may be concluded from these data that correlations between schizophrenia and HLA antigens which remain doubtful could be explained with a biological genetic heterogeneity of schizophrenic disorders. Review of literature concerning the identification of HLA haplotypes in schizophrenics pedigrees and about the HLA system as a genetic marker for the clinical response to neuroleptics in schizophrenic patients or in vitro, is also discussed.",Immunology

Explants of mammary glands of pregnant rabbits cultured in the absence of insulin, prolactin and cortisol incorporated [2-3H]mannose into lipid-linked mono- and oligo-saccharide and protein. 2. Inclusion of the hormones in the culture medium stimulated the incorporation of [2-3H]mannose into lipid-linked monosaccharide 4-fold, into lipid-linked oligosaccharide 4-fold and into protein 13-fold after 24 h in culture. 3. Addition of tunicamycin to the incubation medium completely inhibited the incorporation of [2-3H]mannose into lipid-linked oligosaccharide and protein after an initial lag period of about 2h. Incorporation of this radiolabel into lipid-linked monosaccharide was increased 4-fold under these conditions. 4. Incorporation of [4,5-3H]leucine into protein was unaffected by the presence of tunicamycin. 5. Analysis of mannose-labelled protein by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis indicated that a major radiolabelled protein of apparent mol.wt. 65,000-70,000 was synthesized and approx. 70% of this protein appeared in the soluble fraction. 6.

Transport of glycine has been demonstrated in membrane vesicles isolated from rat brain, using artificially imposed ion gradients as the sole energy source. 2. The uptake of glycine is strictly dependent on the presence of Na+ and Cl- in the medium, and the process can be driven either by an Na+ gradient (out greater than in) or by a C1- gradient (out greater than in) when the other essential ion is present. 3. The uptake of glycine is stimulated by a membrane potential (interior negative), as demonstrated by the effects of the ionophores valinomycin and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and anions of different permeabilities. 4. The kinetic analysis shows that glycine is accumulated by two systems with different affinities. 5. The presence of ouabain, an inhibitor (Na+ + K+)-activated ATPase, does not affect glycine transport. 6. The existence of a high-affinity, Na+-dependent glycine-uptake system in membrane vesicles derived from rat brain suggests that this amino acid may have a transmitter role in some areas of the rat brain.",Immunology
7326001,"O-(4-Diazo-3,5-di[125I]iodobenzoyl)sucrose, a novel radioactive label for determining organ sites of catabolism of plasma proteins. A method is described for radiolabelling proteins with O-(4-diazo-3,5-di[125I]iodobenzoyl)sucrose (DD125IBS). When proteins so labelled were degraded within lysosomes, the radioactive fragments were largely retained within the organelle. High specific radioactivities were obtained without changing the properties of the protein. The validity of the method was demonstrated in vivo in rats using the short-lived protein lactate dehydrogenase, isoenzyme M4, and the long-lived protein bovine serum albumin. Derivatization with DD125IBS did not alter the clearance of either protein. Uptake of DD125IBS-labelled lactate dehydrogenase, isoenzyme M4, by liver and spleen of rats was determined. Radioactivity in these tissues increased up to about 2 h after injection (at this time the protein has been almost completely cleared from the blood) and subsequently declined with a half-life of approx. 20 h. After differential fractionation of liver, radioactivity was largely found in the mitochondrial and lysosomal fraction. The results of these studies establish that DD125IBS covalently coupled to plasma proteins should be a useful radioactive tracer for identifying the tissue and cellular sites of catabolism of relatively long-lived circulating proteins.",Immunology

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed diets containing 20% (w/w) soya-bean oil, high-erucic acid rapeseed oil or low-erucic acid rapeseed oil for 0, 12 or 23 days. The type of fat present in the diet had no effect on the total phospholipid content of heart mitochondria (micrograms/mg of protein) but did influence the phospholipid class distribution. Rats fed high-erucic acid rapeseed oil for 12 or 23 days had significantly higher mitochondrial phosphatidylcholine content than rats fed soya-bean oil. Low-erucic acid rapeseed oil resulted in elevation of cardiac mitochondrial cardiolipin content after dietary treatment for 12 days. The results demonstrate in vivo that diet is a significant determinant of the phospholipid class content of subcellular membranes.",Immunology
7325991,"Selective depletion of small basic non-glycosylated proteins in diabetes. Degradative rates of small basic non-glycosylated proteins are preferentially enhanced in rat liver cytosol during severe streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Synthetic rates of these classes of proteins are not selectively enhanced in diabetes, so small basic non-glycosylated proteins should be depleted from liver cytosol as a consequence of this disease. To test this hypothesis, proteins were analysed from normal animals, from diabetic animals receiving insulin and from diabetic animals after insulin withdrawal for 3 days. The proteins were separated according to subunit molecular weight by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, according to isoelectric point by isoelectric focusing and according to carbohydrate content by affinity chromatography with concanavalin A linked to agarose. Severe uncontrolled diabetes is associated with the predicted depletion of small basic non-glycosylated proteins from liver cytosol. The preferential degradation and loss of these protein classes may be of considerable physiological importance to the animal.",Immunology

Bile acids were found to inhibit the total soluble-fraction glutathione S-transferase activity from rat liver, as assayed with four different acceptor substrates. Dihydroxy bile acids were more inhibitory than trihydroxy bile acids, and conjugated bile acids were generally less inhibitory than the parent bile acid. At physiological concentrations of bile acid, the glutathione S-transferase activity in the soluble fraction was inhibited by nearly 50%. This indicates that the size of the hepatic pool of bile acids can influence the ability of the liver to detoxify electrophilic compounds. The A, B and C isoenzymes of glutathione S-transferase were isolated separately. Each was found to be inhibited by bile acids. Kinetic analysis of the inhibition revealed that the bile acids were not competitive inhibitors of either glutathione or acceptor substrate binding. The microsomal glutathione S-transferase from guinea-pig liver was also shown to be inhibited by bile acids. This inhibition, however, showed characteristics of a non-specific detergent-type inhibition.",Immunology

Subsequently, the genetic basis for the observed geographic differences was established by within-strain and between-strain reciprocal crosses of the two most divergent strains. The results indicate that simple additive genetic factors are involved in the transmission of this behavior, with no detectable differences between sexes or evidence of maternal effects.",Immunology

Variations to immunoreactive growth hormone (GH) and bioassayable somatomedin-like activity (SLA) were determined in the plasma of the domestic fowl. The plasma concentrations of SLA (potency relative to a pooled serum standard) and GH were both inversely age-related in growing cockerels (Thornber 909) between 3 and 20 weeks of age (SLA, r = 0.454; P less than 0.01, GH, r = 0.548; P less than 0.01) and directly related to each other (r = 0.54; P less than 0.01). In immature birds maintained on a photoperiod of 16 h light, 8 h darkness, plasma concentrations of SLA were highest during the first hour of darkness (1.19 +/- 0.18 units/ ml (u/ml) mean +/- S.E.M., n = 6) and significantly lower 1 h after dawn (0.78 +/- 0.07 u/ml n = 6). No diurnal variations in plasma concentrations of GH were observed. Deprivation of food in two strains of chickens (Thornber 909 and broiler) significantly reduced plasma concentrations of SLA in both strains and increased plasma concentrations of GH in the Thornber strain. Re-feeding fasted Thornber chickens caused the plasma concentrations of SLA and GH to return to normal within 24 h but had no effect in broilers. Deprivation of water, which also reduces food intake, for 12, 18 and 24 h markedly reduced plasma concentrations of SLA but had no effect on plasma GH concentration in Thornber cockerels.",Immunology

Two to three months after parasympathetic decentralization, the gland weight was found to be significantly increased by nearly 100%. This trophic effect is mainly due to the proliferation of young acinar cells. Concomitantly, there is a decrease of the ductular mass and of the Langerhans islets. Choline acetylase activity was decreased by about 35% to 40% in the vagotomized pancreas. Further, enzyme concentration was found to be greater in the head than in the body and tail of the gland, thus suggesting a higher nerve density of vagal cholinergic fibers in the former than in the latter. Basal pancreatic secretion of the decentralized gland showed a significant increase in the flow rate with no significant changes in both bicarbonate concentration and output. Protein concentration was significantly reduced at 60 minutes; protein output remained unchanged. The most remarkable finding was the fall in both lipase concentration and output (60-70%) when compared with control values. These findings may be related to clinical manifestations after long-term vagotomy.",Immunology

We report three cases of GBS pharyngitis in patients with underlying diseases, two of whom were treated with and responded incompletely to oral beta-lactam antibiotics. The susceptibility of 20 clinical isolates of GBS was tested by a broth dilution method to six antibiotics which could conceivably be used in the therapy of GBS pharyngitis. Penicillin G, clindamycin, and erythromycin were most active with mean minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 0.06 μg/ml or less. Rifampin and cefaclor were least active with mean MICs of 0.71 ug/ml or more. Ampicillin was intermediate in its activity. Therapy traditionally used for Group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis may, at times, be suboptimal for GBS pharyngitis in compromised patients. This may be due to higher minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of GBS than GAS, to inadequate penetration of penicillins into pharyngeal tissues or to host factors. It is suggested that GBS can cause pharyngitis in adults, particularly the compromised patient, and that in cases where there is a poor response to penicillin or ampicillin therapy, alternative drugs (erythromycin or clindamycin) may be used.",Immunology
