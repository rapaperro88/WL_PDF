7544188,"""Rebound"" phenomenon of hepatitis C viremia after interferon therapy in ""relapsed"" patients with chronic hepatitis C. The correlation between serum hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA and aminotransferase levels following completion of interferon therapy was evaluated in eight relapsed patients with chronic hepatitis C. Both HCV-RNA and aminotransferase levels were significantly increased in the relapsed patients 1 month after completion of therapy, compared to pretreatment values, despite aminotransferase levels being normal and HCV-RNA being undetectable by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay at the end of therapy. The serum levels of HCV-RNA and aminotransferase were significantly elevated 1 and 2 months post-treatment. They then decreased to pretreatment values 3-5 months after the completion of therapy. Thus, in relapsed patients after the completion of therapy, the changes in HCV-RNA levels preceded the elevation in aminotransferase levels. These findings suggest a correlation between serum HCV-RNA levels and aminotransferase levels in relapsed patients with chronic hepatitis C after the completion of interferon therapy.",Gene therapy,rebound phenomenon hepatitis viremia interferon therapy relapsed patient chronic hepatitis correlation serum hepatitis virus hcvrna aminotransferase level following completion interferon therapy evaluated eight relapsed patient chronic hepatitis hcvrna aminotransferase level significantly increased relapsed patient month completion therapy compared pretreatment value despite aminotransferase level normal hcvrna undetectable reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay end therapy serum level hcvrna aminotransferase significantly elevated month posttreatment decreased pretreatment value month completion therapy thus relapsed patient completion therapy change hcvrna level preceded elevation aminotransferase level finding suggest correlation serum hcvrna level aminotransferase level relapsed patient chronic hepatitis completion interferon therapy
7543681,"Probing the transmembrane topology of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels with a gene fusion approach. Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) cation channels contain two short sequence motifs--a residual voltage-sensor (S4) and a pore-forming (P) segment--that are reminiscent of similar segments in voltage-activated Shaker-type K+ channels. It has been tacitly assumed that CNG channels and this K+ channel subfamily share a common overall topology, characterized by a hydrophobic domain comprising six membrane-spanning segments. We have systematically investigated the topology of CNG channels from bovine rod photoreceptor and Drosophila melanogaster by a gene fusion approach using the bacterial reporter enzymes alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase, which are active only in the periplasm and only in the cytoplasm, respectively. Enzymatic activity was determined after expression of fusion constructs in Escherichia coli. CNG channels were found to have six membrane-spanning segments, suggesting that CNG and Shaker-type K+ channels, albeit distant relatives within a gene superfamily of ion channels, share a common topology.",Gene therapy,probing transmembrane topology cyclic nucleotidegated ion channel gene fusion approach cyclic nucleotidegated cng cation channel contain two short sequence motifsa residual voltagesensor poreforming segmentthat reminiscent similar segment voltageactivated shakertype channel tacitly assumed cng channel channel subfamily share common overall topology characterized hydrophobic domain comprising six membranespanning segment systematically investigated topology cng channel bovine rod photoreceptor drosophila melanogaster gene fusion approach using bacterial reporter enzyme alkaline phosphatase betagalactosidase active periplasm cytoplasm respectively enzymatic activity determined expression fusion construct escherichia coli cng channel found six membranespanning segment suggesting cng shakertype channel albeit distant relative within gene superfamily ion channel share common topology
7543632,"Autolymphocyte therapy. III. Effective adjuvant adoptive cellular therapy with in vivo anti-tumor specificity against murine melanoma and carcinoma using ex-vivo-activated memory T-lymphocytes. Autolymphocyte therapy (ALT) is adoptive cellular therapy of neoplastic disease based upon ex vivo activation of lymphocytes by either the supernatant derived from a previously prepared one-way mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) or using low doses of the mitogenic monoclonal antibody OKT3 and a mixture of previously prepared cytokines (T3CS). We have previously demonstrated that nonspecific ex vivo activation of splenocytes from murine tumor-bearing hosts (TBH) using an MLC-supernatant or T3CS without the use of tumor antigen results in the expansion of the CD44+ (memory) T-cell subset. These CD44+ T-cells are the principal mediators of anti-tumor specificity in the ALT-cell population in advanced metastatic murine tumors and are able to protect against tumor challenge in healthy syngeneic mice (HSM). To determine if ALT is effective in an adjuvant setting, C57BL/6J splenocytes from HSM and TBH with B16 melanoma or Lewis lung (3LL) carcinoma were activated ex vivo using T3CS. Mice were implanted with either B16 melanoma or 3LL carcinoma and then underwent surgical excision of tumor. Tumor-excised mice (TEM) then received small numbers (10(6)) of ALT-cells derived from 3LL-TBH or B16-TBH splenocytes, HSM-derived ALT-cells, fresh splenocytes derived from 3LL-TBH or B16-TBH, or CD44-depleted ALT-cells. Significant anti-tumor activity as shown by prolonged survival (Day 100), cure of disease, and rejection of a local and systemic tumor rechallenge was demonstrated in 3LL-TEM that received B16-derived ALT-cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Gene therapy,autolymphocyte therapy iii effective adjuvant adoptive cellular therapy vivo antitumor specificity murine melanoma carcinoma using exvivoactivated memory tlymphocytes autolymphocyte therapy alt adoptive cellular therapy neoplastic disease based upon ex vivo activation lymphocyte either supernatant derived previously prepared oneway mixed lymphocyte culture mlc using low dos mitogenic monoclonal antibody okt mixture previously prepared cytokine tc previously demonstrated nonspecific ex vivo activation splenocytes murine tumorbearing host tbh using mlcsupernatant tc without use tumor antigen result expansion cd memory tcell subset cd tcells principal mediator antitumor specificity altcell population advanced metastatic murine tumor able protect tumor challenge healthy syngeneic mouse hsm determine alt effective adjuvant setting cblj splenocytes hsm tbh melanoma lewis lung carcinoma activated ex vivo using tc mouse implanted either melanoma carcinoma underwent surgical excision tumor tumorexcised mouse tem received small number altcells derived lltbh btbh splenocytes hsmderived altcells fresh splenocytes derived lltbh btbh cddepleted altcells significant antitumor activity shown prolonged survival day cure disease rejection local systemic tumor rechallenge demonstrated lltem received bderived altcellsabstract truncated word
7543577,"Syntheses, calcium channel agonist-antagonist modulation activities, and voltage-clamp studies of isopropyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3-nitro-4-pyridinylpyridine-5-carboxylate racemates and enantiomers. A novel group of racemic isopropyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3-nitro-4-pyridinylpyridine-5-carboxylate isomers [(+/-)-12-14] were prepared using a modified Hantzsch reaction that involved the condensation of nitroacetone with isopropyl 3-aminocrotonate and 2-, 3-, or 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde. Determination of their in vitro calcium channel-modulating activities using guinea pig ileum longitudinal smooth muscle (GPILSM) and guinea pig left atrium (GPLA) assays showed that the 2-pyridinyl isomer (+/-)-12 acted as a dual cardioselective calcium channel agonist (GPLA)/smooth muscle selective calcium channel antagonist (GPILSM). In contrast, the 3-pyridinyl [(+/-)-13] and 4-pyridinyl [(+/-)-14] isomers acted as calcium channel agonists on both GPLA and GPILSM. The agonist effect exhibited by (+/-)-12 on GPLA was inhibited by nifedipine and partially reversed by addition of extracellular Ca2+. In anesthetized rabbits, the 4-pyridinyl isomer (+/-)-14 exhibited a hypertensive effect that was qualitatively similar to that exhibited by the nonselective agonist Bay K 8644 and the 3-pyridinyl isomer (+/)-13, whereas the 2-pyridinyl isomer (+/-)-12 induced a hypotensive effect similar to that of the calcium channel antagonist nifedipine. Similar results were obtained in a spontaneously hypertensive rat model. In vitro studies showed that the (+)-2-pyridinyl enantiomer (+)-12A exhibited agonist activity on both GPILSM and GPLA, but that the (-)-2-pyridinyl enantiomer (-)-12B exhibited agonist activity on GPLA and antagonist activity on GPILSM. Whole-cell voltage-clamp studies using isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes indicated that (-)-12B inhibited the calcium current (ICa), that (+)-12A increased slightly ICa, and that (+/-)-12 inhibited ICa but the latter inhibition was less than that for (-)-12B. (-)-12B effectively inhibited ICa at all membrane potentials examined (-40-50 mV), whereas (+)-12A exhibited a weak agonist effect near the peak of the I-V curve. The 2-pyridinyl isomers (enantiomers) 12 represent a novel type of 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel modulator that could provide a potentially new approach to drug discovery targeted toward the treatment of congestive heart failure and probes to study the structure-function relationships of calcium channels.",Gene therapy,synthesis calcium channel agonistantagonist modulation activity voltageclamp study isopropyl dihydrodimethylnitropyridinylpyridinecarboxylate racemates enantiomer novel group racemic isopropyl dihydrodimethylnitropyridinylpyridinecarboxylate isomer prepared using modified hantzsch reaction involved condensation nitroacetone isopropyl aminocrotonate pyridinecarboxaldehyde determination vitro calcium channelmodulating activity using guinea pig ileum longitudinal smooth muscle gpilsm guinea pig left atrium gpla assay showed pyridinyl isomer acted dual cardioselective calcium channel agonist gplasmooth muscle selective calcium channel antagonist gpilsm contrast pyridinyl pyridinyl isomer acted calcium channel agonist gpla gpilsm agonist effect exhibited gpla inhibited nifedipine partially reversed addition extracellular ca anesthetized rabbit pyridinyl isomer exhibited hypertensive effect qualitatively similar exhibited nonselective agonist bay pyridinyl isomer whereas pyridinyl isomer induced hypotensive effect similar calcium channel antagonist nifedipine similar result obtained spontaneously hypertensive rat model vitro study showed pyridinyl enantiomer exhibited agonist activity gpilsm gpla pyridinyl enantiomer exhibited agonist activity gpla antagonist activity gpilsm wholecell voltageclamp study using isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes indicated inhibited calcium current ica increased slightly ica inhibited ica latter inhibition le effectively inhibited ica membrane potential examined mv whereas exhibited weak agonist effect near peak iv curve pyridinyl isomer enantiomer represent novel type dihydropyridine calcium channel modulator provide potentially new approach drug discovery targeted toward treatment congestive heart failure probe study structurefunction relationship calcium channel

7543044,"The role of the NPXY motif in the insulin receptor in tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and Shc. The insulin receptor phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and Shc on tyrosine residues, both of which associate with the protein-abundant Src homology/growth factor receptor-bound protein 2(ASH/GRB2) leading to p21ras activation. Juxtamembrane Tyr960 of the insulin receptor required for tyrosine phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and Shc is contained in the NPXY motif, which is also present in other tyrosine kinase receptors and oncogene products. In this study, the role of this motif in insulin's signaling was examined in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing insulin receptors with mutations in this motif. All alterations in Tyr960 examined decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and Shc to a similar extent. The replacements of Asn957 and the deletion of NPE impaired tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and IRS-1, although tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc was more severely affected than that of IRS-1. The amount of ASH/GRB2 bound to IRS-1 and Shc in vitro and in vivo was also decreased in these cells. These data suggest that the NPXY motif in the insulin receptor is important for tyrosine phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and Shc as well as subsequent signaling.",Gene therapy,role npxy motif insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation insulin receptor substrate shc insulin receptor phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate irs shc tyrosine residue associate proteinabundant src homologygrowth factor receptorbound protein ashgrb leading pras activation juxtamembrane tyr insulin receptor required tyrosine phosphorylation irs shc contained npxy motif also present tyrosine kinase receptor oncogene product study role motif insulin signaling examined chinese hamster ovary cell expressing insulin receptor mutation motif alteration tyr examined decreased tyrosine phosphorylation irs shc similar extent replacement asn deletion npe impaired tyrosine phosphorylation shc irs although tyrosine phosphorylation shc severely affected irs amount ashgrb bound irs shc vitro vivo also decreased cell data suggest npxy motif insulin receptor important tyrosine phosphorylation irs shc well subsequent signaling
7543043,"Suppression of development of experimental autoimmune thyroiditis by oral administration of thyroglobulin. Experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT), which to some extent represents an experimental model of human chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is an organ-specific autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibody production to thyroid antigens (Ag) and mononuclear infiltration of the thyroid gland. EAT induced by immunization with human thyroglobulin (hTG) with Freund's adjuvant in CBA/J (H-2K) mice is associated with prominent B and T cell responses. We report that oral administration of hTG effectively reduces the immune responses in EAT in mice in an Ag-specific manner. Both cellular and humoral immune responses are reduced in a dose-dependent manner. Histological evidence of disease is dramatically reduced. Suppression of the immune responses is seen 2 weeks after Ag challenge, with partial inhibition of proliferative and antibody responses. Six weeks after immunization, further inhibition is observed of both T and B cell responses. Hyporesponsiveness of T and B cell reactivity is seen only to hTG; T and B cell responses to other immunogens are not affected, including purified protein derivative and the nonrelated Ag BSA. This model may provide the basis for immunotherapy of autoimmune thyroid diseases in man.",Gene therapy,suppression development experimental autoimmune thyroiditis oral administration thyroglobulin experimental autoimmune thyroiditis eat extent represents experimental model human chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis organspecific autoimmune disease characterized autoantibody production thyroid antigen ag mononuclear infiltration thyroid gland eat induced immunization human thyroglobulin htg freunds adjuvant cbaj hk mouse associated prominent cell response report oral administration htg effectively reduces immune response eat mouse agspecific manner cellular humoral immune response reduced dosedependent manner histological evidence disease dramatically reduced suppression immune response seen week ag challenge partial inhibition proliferative antibody response six week immunization inhibition observed cell response hyporesponsiveness cell reactivity seen htg cell response immunogen affected including purified protein derivative nonrelated ag bsa model may provide basis immunotherapy autoimmune thyroid disease man

7542771,"Effect of a novel cholecystokinin receptor antagonist, FK480, administered intraduodenally, on pancreatic secretion in rats. The effect of a new cholecystokinin (CCK)-A receptor antagonist, FK480, developed in Japan, on pancreatic exocrine secretion stimulated by exogenous CCK and intraduodenal casein was investigated in vivo when administered to anesthetized rats intraduodenally, and its CCK antagonistic activity was compared with that of CR 1505. Intraduodenal administration of FK480 at graded doses of 0.0016-1.0 mg/kg-h produced dose-dependent inhibition of pancreatic juice volume and amylase output stimulated by intravenous infusion of CCK-8 at a dose of 0.06 micrograms/kg-h. The half-maximal inhibitory dose (ID50) of FK480 for CCK-8-stimulated amylase secretion was 0.025 mg/kg-h, whereas the ID50 of CR 1505 was 5.2 mg/kg-h, indicating that FK480 is 208 times more potent than CR 1505. Moreover, intraduodenal FK480 (0.2 mg/kg-h) significantly suppressed pancreatic juice volume and amylase output augmented by intraduodenal infusion of casein (400 mg/h).

Ursodeoxycholate (UDCA; 300 microM) significantly stimulates amylase secretion from isolated rat pancreatic acini but not Ca2+ mobilization. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ completely abolished the UDCA-stimulated secretory response. Ca ionophore (A23187) potentiated the response. However, staurosporine, a protein kinase C inhibitor, did not affect the UDCA-stimulated amylase secretion. These results indicated that UDCA directly acted on the pancreatic acini and stimulated amylase secretion by the mechanism of stimulation of influx of extracellular Ca2+, but not through inositol [1,4,5] triphosphate and diacylglycerol formation or Ca2+ mobilization.",Gene therapy,stimulatory effect ursodeoxycholate pancreatic exocrine secretion vitro study ursodeoxycholate udca microm significantly stimulates amylase secretion isolated rat pancreatic acinus ca mobilization removal extracellular ca completely abolished udcastimulated secretory response ca ionophore potentiated response however staurosporine protein kinase inhibitor affect udcastimulated amylase secretion result indicated udca directly acted pancreatic acinus stimulated amylase secretion mechanism stimulation influx extracellular ca inositol triphosphate diacylglycerol formation ca mobilization
7542747,"Mutations in the gene for the granulocyte colony-stimulating-factor receptor in patients with acute myeloid leukemia preceded by severe congenital neutropenia. In severe congenital neutropenia the maturation of myeloid progenitor cells is arrested. The myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia develop in some patients with severe congenital neutropenia. Abnormalities in the signal-transduction pathways for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) may play a part in the progression to acute myeloid leukemia. We isolated genomic DNA and RNA from hematopoietic cells obtained from two patients with acute myeloid leukemia and histories of severe congenital neutropenia. The nucleotide sequences encoding the cytoplasmic domain of the G-CSF receptor were amplified by means of the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Murine myeloid 32D.C10 cells were transfected with complementary DNA encoding the wild-type or mutant G-CSF receptors and tested for their responses to G-CSF. Point mutations in the gene for the G-CSF receptor were identified in both patients. The mutations, a substitution of thymine for cytosine at the codon for glutamine at position 718 (Gln718) in one patient and at the codon for glutamine at position 731(Gln731) in the other, caused a truncation of the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of the receptor. Both mutant and wild-type genes for the G-CSF receptor were present in leukemic cells from the two patients. In one patient, the mutation was also found in the neutropenic stage, before the progression to acute myeloid leukemia. The 32D.C10 cells expressing mutant receptors had abnormally high proliferative responses but failed to mature when cultured in G-CSF. The mutant G-CSF receptors also interfered with terminal maturation mediated by the wild-type G-CSF receptor in the 32D.C10 cells that coexpressed the wild-type and mutant receptors. Mutations in the gene for the G-CSF receptor that interrupt signals required for the maturation of myeloid cells are involved in the pathogenesis of severe congenital neutropenia and associated with the progression to acute myeloid leukemia.",Gene therapy,mutation gene granulocyte colonystimulatingfactor receptor patient acute myeloid leukemia preceded severe congenital neutropenia severe congenital neutropenia maturation myeloid progenitor cell arrested myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia develop patient severe congenital neutropenia abnormality signaltransduction pathway granulocyte colonystimulating factor gcsf may play part progression acute myeloid leukemia isolated genomic dna rna hematopoietic cell obtained two patient acute myeloid leukemia history severe congenital neutropenia nucleotide sequence encoding cytoplasmic domain gcsf receptor amplified mean polymerase chain reaction sequenced murine myeloid dc cell transfected complementary dna encoding wildtype mutant gcsf receptor tested response gcsf point mutation gene gcsf receptor identified patient mutation substitution thymine cytosine codon glutamine position gln one patient codon glutamine position gln caused truncation cterminal cytoplasmic region receptor mutant wildtype gene gcsf receptor present leukemic cell two patient one patient mutation also found neutropenic stage progression acute myeloid leukemia dc cell expressing mutant receptor abnormally high proliferative response failed mature cultured gcsf mutant gcsf receptor also interfered terminal maturation mediated wildtype gcsf receptor dc cell coexpressed wildtype mutant receptor mutation gene gcsf receptor interrupt signal required maturation myeloid cell involved pathogenesis severe congenital neutropenia associated progression acute myeloid leukemia
7542703,"Malnutrition and the brain: changing concepts, changing concerns. Our conceptions of how malnutrition endured early in life affects brain development have evolved considerably since the mid-1960s. At that time, it was feared that malnutrition endured during certain sensitive periods in early development would produce irreversible brain damage possibly resulting in mental retardation and an impairment in brain function. We now know that most of the alterations in the growth of various brain structures eventually recover (to some extent), although permanent alterations in the hippocampus and cerebellum remain. However, recent neuropharmacological research has revealed long-lasting, if not permanent, changes in brain neural receptor function resulting from an early episode of malnutrition. These more recent findings indicate that the kinds of behaviors and cognitive functions impaired by malnutrition may be more related to emotional responses to stressful events than to cognitive deficits per se, the age range of vulnerability to these long-term effects of malnutrition may be much greater than we had suspected and the minimal amount of malnutrition (hunger) necessary to produce these long-term alterations is unknown.",Gene therapy,malnutrition brain changing concept changing concern conception malnutrition endured early life affect brain development evolved considerably since mids time feared malnutrition endured certain sensitive period early development produce irreversible brain damage possibly resulting mental retardation impairment brain function know alteration growth various brain structure eventually recover extent although permanent alteration hippocampus cerebellum remain however recent neuropharmacological research revealed longlasting permanent change brain neural receptor function resulting early episode malnutrition recent finding indicate kind behavior cognitive function impaired malnutrition may related emotional response stressful event cognitive deficit per se age range vulnerability longterm effect malnutrition may much greater suspected minimal amount malnutrition hunger necessary produce longterm alteration unknown
7542684,"Measurement of methemoglobin formation from oxyhemoglobin. A real-time, continuous assay of nitric oxide release by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. We have evaluated the spectrophotometric measurement (at 401 vs. 411 nm) of nitric oxide (NO)-dependent methemoglobin formation from oxyhemoglobin in order to assess NO release from human polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes (PMN). S-nitroso-D,L-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP, 25-200 microM), a donor of NO, induced a dose-dependent methemoglobin formation. Furthermore, when PMN were activated with N-formyl-methionylleucyl-phenylalanine or phorbol myristate acetate in the presence of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase, methemoglobin formation ensued. The amount of methemoglobin formed was dependent on the amounts of oxyhemoglobin and stimulus used, and the number of PMN in the assay. The NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors NG-monomethyl-L-arginine or nitro-L-arginine methyl ester did not affect methemoglobin generation from oxyhemoglobin induced by SNAP but inhibited that mediated by activated PMN with IC50 values of 250 microM and 340 microM, respectively. The substrate for NO formation from NOS, L-arginine in concentrations up to 1 mM did not significantly influence the methemoglobin formation either induced by SNAP or activated PMN. Exclusion of SOD did not affect SNAP-dependent oxidation of oxyhemoglobin. Exclusion of SOD from the cell-containing system attenuated methemoglobin formation, and if catalase was also excluded the response was further reduced. Finally, PMN from a patient with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease, unable to produce superoxide anions, showed a similar production of methemoglobin from HbO2 as did healthy PMN, activated with the respective agonists. We conclude that spectrophotometric measurement of methemoglobin formation from oxyhemoglobin in the presence of SOD and catalase is a suitable method for the measurement of NO release from PMN, with the benefits of a real-time, continuous assay.",Gene therapy,measurement methemoglobin formation oxyhemoglobin realtime continuous assay nitric oxide release human polymorphonuclear leukocyte evaluated spectrophotometric measurement v nm nitric oxide nodependent methemoglobin formation oxyhemoglobin order ass release human polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocyte pmn snitrosodlacetylpenicillamine snap microm donor induced dosedependent methemoglobin formation furthermore pmn activated nformylmethionylleucylphenylalanine phorbol myristate acetate presence superoxide dismutase sod catalase methemoglobin formation ensued amount methemoglobin formed dependent amount oxyhemoglobin stimulus used number pmn assay synthase no inhibitor ngmonomethyllarginine nitrolarginine methyl ester affect methemoglobin generation oxyhemoglobin induced snap inhibited mediated activated pmn ic value microm microm respectively substrate formation no larginine concentration mm significantly influence methemoglobin formation either induced snap activated pmn exclusion sod affect snapdependent oxidation oxyhemoglobin exclusion sod cellcontaining system attenuated methemoglobin formation catalase also excluded response reduced finally pmn patient xlinked chronic granulomatous disease unable produce superoxide anion showed similar production methemoglobin hbo healthy pmn activated respective agonist conclude spectrophotometric measurement methemoglobin formation oxyhemoglobin presence sod catalase suitable method measurement release pmn benefit realtime continuous assay

Buprenorphine, a mixed opioid agonist-antagonist, is being investigated as a treatment for opioid dependence. This study compared the acute subjective and physiological effects of sublingual buprenorphine to those of p.o. methadone over a wide range of doses and compared the ability of both drugs to alter the effects of an opioid challenge. Male inpatient volunteers (n = 9) with histories of opioid abuse participated in this double-blind, double-dummy study. Sublingual buprenorphine (0, 0.5, 2, 8, 16 and 32 mg) and p.o. methadone (3.75, 15 and 60 mg) were administered once weekly according to a Latin-square design, and subjects were monitored on a variety of physiological and subjective measures. Twenty-four hours later, subjects were tested with ascending doses of i.m. hydromorphone (0, 1 and 4 mg) given 45 min apart. Buprenorphine and methadone produced typical opioid agonist effects of long duration, including pupillary constriction, respiratory depression and elevations on subject-rated and observer-rated indices of euphoria, sedation and opioid-like symptoms. The buprenorphine dose-effect curves were nonlinear and maximal effects for most physiological and subjective measures were observed between 4 and 8 mg, with no greater effects observed at higher doses. The methadone dose-effect curves were linear across the range of doses tested. High doses of buprenorphine and methadone both attenuated the response to hydromorphone challenge 24 hr later. These data indicate that there is a ceiling on the effects of buprenorphine in humans that may reduce its abuse liability and increase its safety, and indicate that opioid blockade occurs after acute administration of buprenorphine or methadone.",Gene therapy,acute administration buprenorphine human partial agonist blockade effect buprenorphine mixed opioid agonistantagonist investigated treatment opioid dependence study compared acute subjective physiological effect sublingual buprenorphine po methadone wide range dos compared ability drug alter effect opioid challenge male inpatient volunteer history opioid abuse participated doubleblind doubledummy study sublingual buprenorphine mg po methadone mg administered weekly according latinsquare design subject monitored variety physiological subjective measure twentyfour hour later subject tested ascending dos im hydromorphone mg given min apart buprenorphine methadone produced typical opioid agonist effect long duration including pupillary constriction respiratory depression elevation subjectrated observerrated index euphoria sedation opioidlike symptom buprenorphine doseeffect curve nonlinear maximal effect physiological subjective measure observed mg greater effect observed higher dos methadone doseeffect curve linear across range dos tested high dos buprenorphine methadone attenuated response hydromorphone challenge hr later data indicate ceiling effect buprenorphine human may reduce abuse liability increase safety indicate opioid blockade occurs acute administration buprenorphine methadone
7542167,"Functional evidence that cell surface galectin-3 mediates homotypic cell adhesion. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a beta-galactoside-binding protein with M(r) approximately 30,000. Cell surface Gal-3 is postulated to be involved in homotypic aggregation of tumor cells in the circulation during metastasis through attachment to a complementary serum glycoprotein(s), which serves as a cross-linking bridge between adjacent cells. To test this hypothesis a recombinant strain of baculovirus encoding Gal-3 was used to infect Sf9 insect cells, which lack endogenous Gal-3. Immunoblotting and indirect immunofluorescence studies revealed that the infection with recombinant virus conferred Gal-3 expression on Sf9 cells, and the Gal-3 was localized on the cell surface as well as in the cytoplasm. Sf9 cells infected with recombinant virus underwent homotypic aggregation in the presence of exogenous glycoprotein (i.e., asialofetuin), whereas control cells uninfected or infected with wild-type virus did not. Lactose and Fab' fragments of anti-Gal-3 antibodies markedly inhibited the cell-cell aggregation. Moreover, cosuspension of Sf9 cells infected with the recombinant virus with uninfected cells in the presence of asialofetuin resulted in a preferential cell-cell adhesion of the Gal-3-expressing cells. These results directly demonstrate the ability of cell surface Gal-3 molecules to mediate homotypic cell adhesion by bridging through branched, soluble complementary glycoconjugates.",Gene therapy,functional evidence cell surface galectin mediates homotypic cell adhesion galectin gal betagalactosidebinding protein mr approximately cell surface gal postulated involved homotypic aggregation tumor cell circulation metastasis attachment complementary serum glycoprotein serf crosslinking bridge adjacent cell test hypothesis recombinant strain baculovirus encoding gal used infect sf insect cell lack endogenous gal immunoblotting indirect immunofluorescence study revealed infection recombinant virus conferred gal expression sf cell gal localized cell surface well cytoplasm sf cell infected recombinant virus underwent homotypic aggregation presence exogenous glycoprotein ie asialofetuin whereas control cell uninfected infected wildtype virus lactose fab fragment antigal antibody markedly inhibited cellcell aggregation moreover cosuspension sf cell infected recombinant virus uninfected cell presence asialofetuin resulted preferential cellcell adhesion galexpressing cell result directly demonstrate ability cell surface gal molecule mediate homotypic cell adhesion bridging branched soluble complementary glycoconjugates
7542164,"Volunteers, doctors take palliative care into the community. The face of palliative care is changing. In Ontario's St. Catharines region there has been a concerted effort to make it more of a community-based procedure. A local college even teaches a 2-year course in palliative care.

7542138,"Are pelvic computed tomography, bone scan and pelvic lymphadenectomy necessary in the staging of prostatic cancer?. To investigate the effectiveness and economy of pelvic computed tomography (CT), bone scan and pelvic lymphadenectomy as staging modalities in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. The use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) and Gleason's score as adjuncts to predict extracapsular disease were also evaluated and their economic implications examined. Between January 1990 and June 1993, 861 men were newly diagnosed with prostate cancer, of whom 409 underwent surgery. All patients underwent pelvic CT scans and PSA analysis. Patients undergoing surgery had pre-operative bone scans and Gleason's scoring of their pathological tissue. Only 13 (1.5%) of 861 men had positive pelvic CT scans. Of the 409 patients who underwent surgery, all had negative pelvic CT and bone scans, and all underwent a modified pelvic lymphadenectomy; 192 (47%) had extracapsular disease. Only 15 (3.7%) patients who underwent surgery were found to have positive nodes. The use of pelvic CT and bone scans for clinical staging in patients with a PSA level of < or = 20 ng/mL should not be advocated because they have a very low yield and are not cost effective. We question the role of a modified pelvic lymphadenectomy for staging purposes, either by an open or laparoscopic procedure, because the yield of positive diagnoses is very low.",Gene therapy,pelvic computed tomography bone scan pelvic lymphadenectomy necessary staging prostatic cancer investigate effectiveness economy pelvic computed tomography ct bone scan pelvic lymphadenectomy staging modality patient undergoing radical prostatectomy use prostate specific antigen psa gleasons score adjunct predict extracapsular disease also evaluated economic implication examined january june men newly diagnosed prostate cancer underwent surgery patient underwent pelvic ct scan psa analysis patient undergoing surgery preoperative bone scan gleasons scoring pathological tissue men positive pelvic ct scan patient underwent surgery negative pelvic ct bone scan underwent modified pelvic lymphadenectomy extracapsular disease patient underwent surgery found positive node use pelvic ct bone scan clinical staging patient psa level ngml advocated low yield cost effective question role modified pelvic lymphadenectomy staging purpose either open laparoscopic procedure yield positive diagnosis low
7542129,"Fusaric acid in Fusarium moniliforme cultures, corn, and feeds toxic to livestock and the neurochemical effects in the brain and pineal gland of rats. Fusaric acid is produced by several species of Fusarium, which commonly infect corn and other agricultural commodities. Since this mycotoxin may augment the effects of other Fusarium toxins, a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method of analysis in feeds was developed. Fusaric acid was analyzed as the trimethylsilyl-ester from F. moniliforme-cultures, -contaminated corn screenings, and feeds toxic to livestock. The mycotoxin was found in all samples and ranged from 0.43 to 12.39 micrograms/g sample. Also, fusaric acid was tested for its neurochemical effects in the brain and pineal gland of rats. Animals were dosed intraperitoneally (100 mg/kg body weight) 30 min prior to the onset of the dark phase (lights out) and the effects were studied at 1.5, 3.5, and 5.5 h after treatment. Brain serotonin (5HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA), tyrosine (TYRO), and dopamine (DA) were increased (P < 0.05) by fusaric acid, and norepinephrine (NEpi) was decreased (P < 0.05). Analogously, DA in the pineal gland increased and NEpi decreased (P < 0.05). Pineal N-acetylserotonin (NAc5HT) was increased (P < 0.05), whereas pineal 5HT and its two major metabolites 5HIAA and 5-hydroxytryptophol (5HTOL) decreased (P < 0.05). Elevated brain TYRO and brain and pineal DA, with decreased NEpi, may be consistent with fusaric acid's partial inhibitory effect on tyrosine-hydroxylase and its inhibitory effect on dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, respectively. Elevated pineal Nac5HT is consistent with decreased pineal 5HT and the increased pineal DA, and support the dopaminergic stimulatory activity of the enzyme responsible for the conversion of 5HT to NAc5HT. This is the first report of fusaric acid's in vivo effect on pineal DA, NEpi, 5HT, and NAc5HT in rats, and a relation for the effects on TYRO, 5HT, and 5HIAA in brain tissue.

These experiments investigated in the rat the impact on spatial delayed non-matching to sample and on acquisition of the Morris water maze of (i) AMPA-induced lesions of the medial septal nucleus, which produced a marked reduction of hippocampal choline acetyltransferase activity and acetylcholine levels (measured using in vivo dialysis) together with lesser reductions in cholinergic markers in the cingulate cortex and (ii) similar AMPA-induced lesions of the vertical limb nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca (vDB), which produced more marked reductions in cholinergic markers in the cingulate cortex than in the hippocampus. Medial septal lesions produced a delay-dependent deficit in spatial working memory, while lesions of the vDB resulted in a delay-independent performance deficit. In addition, rats with vDB lesions adopted biased response strategies during the imposition of long delays.

Platelet formation, occurring from bone marrow or lung megakaryocytes, has been difficult to study mechanistically. Recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (rHuMGDF), a recently described cytokine, has now been used to establish an in vitro system in which this important and little understood process occurs. CD34+ cells cultured with rHuMGDF develop into megakaryocytes which form long cytoplasmic extensions (proplatelets) that fragment into platelet-sized particles (in vitro platelets). Morphologically, in vitro and human plasma-derived platelets (control platelets) are virtually identical with respect to size, dense granule distribution and ultrastructural features. Functionally, in vitro and control platelets have similar aggregation and activation responses, and similarly incorporate mepacrine into dense granules. These findings suggest that rHuMGDF is sufficient to generate platelet-synthesizing megakaryocytes from CD34+ cells and provide an experimental setting in which the study of human platelet formation can be adequately performed.",Gene therapy,recombinant human megakaryocyte growth development factor rhumgdf ligand cmpl produce functional human platelet vitro platelet formation occurring bone marrow lung megakaryocyte difficult study mechanistically recombinant human megakaryocyte growth development factor rhumgdf recently described cytokine used establish vitro system important little understood process occurs cd cell cultured rhumgdf develop megakaryocyte form long cytoplasmic extension proplatelets fragment plateletsized particle vitro platelet morphologically vitro human plasmaderived platelet control platelet virtually identical respect size dense granule distribution ultrastructural feature functionally vitro control platelet similar aggregation activation response similarly incorporate mepacrine dense granule finding suggest rhumgdf sufficient generate plateletsynthesizing megakaryocyte cd cell provide experimental setting study human platelet formation adequately performed

The mechanisms responsible for mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) from the bone marrow into the circulation are unknown. One possibility is that HPC downregulate cell adhesion molecule expression. We studied normal human bone marrow and adult peripheral blood following 4 g/m2 cyclophosphamide and recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rHuG-CSF). Each sample was studied for the coexpression of CD34 and a panel of cell adhesion molecules by dual immunocytometry.

7541709,"Distant metastases from prostatic carcinoma express androgen receptor protein. Nearly all primary prostatic carcinomas have been found to express the androgen receptor (AR) protein, which is the intracellular mediator of androgen action. To gain a better insight into the mechanisms of androgen independence of advanced prostatic carcinoma, it is important to know whether the AR is also present in metastases of androgen-independent tumors. We have assessed the status of the AR and the prostate-specific antigen in 22 metastases of 18 patients with progressive prostate cancer. In 18 cases, the metastases were localized in bone, in 3 cases in the epidural space, and in 1 case in the periosteum. All but one patient had received some kind of endocrine treatment for prostatic carcinoma. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained for the AR following a streptavidinbiotin-peroxidase protocol with the polyclonal antibody PG-21, which is directed against amino acids 1 through 21 of the rat and the human AR. The percentage of AR-positive cells was evaluated on the basis of an arbitrary 4-point scale. All 22 tumor metastases displayed AR positivity. One AR-positive metastatic lesion did not stain for prostate-specific antigen, but in all other metastases, this protein was detected by means of immunohistochemistry. The present study provides evidence that, unlike androgen-independent prostatic carcinoma cell lines, distant prostatic carcinoma metastases do express the AR. These findings indicate that the AR may be involved in the progression of prostate cancer.",Gene therapy,distant metastasis prostatic carcinoma express androgen receptor protein nearly primary prostatic carcinoma found express androgen receptor ar protein intracellular mediator androgen action gain better insight mechanism androgen independence advanced prostatic carcinoma important know whether ar also present metastasis androgenindependent tumor assessed status ar prostatespecific antigen metastasis patient progressive prostate cancer case metastasis localized bone case epidural space case periosteum one patient received kind endocrine treatment prostatic carcinoma paraffinembedded tissue section stained ar following streptavidinbiotinperoxidase protocol polyclonal antibody pg directed amino acid rat human ar percentage arpositive cell evaluated basis arbitrary point scale tumor metastasis displayed ar positivity one arpositive metastatic lesion stain prostatespecific antigen metastasis protein detected mean immunohistochemistry present study provides evidence unlike androgenindependent prostatic carcinoma cell line distant prostatic carcinoma metastasis express ar finding indicate ar may involved progression prostate cancer

7541525,"Mechanisms of dopamine effects on Na-K-ATPase activity in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells. Dopamine decreases tubular sodium reabsorption, attributed in part to Na-K-ATPase inhibition in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT). Because the final regulation of sodium excretion occurs in the collecting duct, where specific dopamine DA1 binding sites have been demonstrated, we examined the effects of dopamine, as well as of DA1 and DA2 receptor agonists on Na-K-ATPase activity and on the number of units in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, which retain differentiated properties of the renal cortical collecting tubule epithelium. Dopamine (10(-5) M) inhibited pump activity (by 50%) and reduced the number of units. This effect was reproduced by the DA1 agonist SKF 38393, which inhibited pump activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner (maximum, 10(-5) M). The DA2 agonist quinpirole hydrochloride was without effect, either alone or in combination with SKF 38393. Inhibition of pump activity by dopamine was totally abolished by H7 (100 microM), an inhibitor of protein kinase (PK), but partially by 2',5'-dideoxy-adenosine (DDA) and H4, respective inhibitors of cAMP production and PKA, which suggests that the dopamine effect on Na-K-ATPase activity may be linked to activation of both PKC and PKA. In these cells, amiloride addition during preincubation did not alter the effect of dopamine on Na-K-ATPase activity; in contrast, furosemide increased further the inhibitory effect of dopamine on the enzyme activity.

The pharmacokinetics of thiocyanate (SCN-) in the blood plasma of 35-g rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were followed during a 20-day exposure to 39.8 mg SCN- liter-1 and the subsequent 16-day depuration period. SCN- concentrations were determined by reverse-phase HPLC. Kinetic constants were estimated using a one-compartment first-order kinetic model fitted to the data by the computer programs BIOFAC and SYSTAT. The respective BIOFAC and SYSTAT estimates for the uptake rate constant (k1, 0.55 and 0.49 day-1), the depuration rate constant (k2, 0.34 and 0.29 day-1), and the bioconcentration factor (BCF, 1.61 and 1.66) were similar for both methods of calculation. Field studies were conducted to determine the impact of SCN- on white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) populations in waters receiving SCN(-)-bearing effluents. The assessment was based on SCN- concentrations in water and fish plasma, and the thyroid histology of the fish. Although SCN- was detected in the water at one site, no SCN- was detected in fish plasma and none of the thyroid pathology characteristic of chronic SCN- exposure was present.

A prospective, double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted over six months at a tertiary referral center with 93,000 annual ED visits. Seventy-three patients completed the study. The patients received either 1 mg of hydromorphone or 50 mg of meperidine IV at t = 0. Pain intensity was determined using a 10-cm visual analog scale at t = 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes. A second dose of the study drug could be given between t = 15 and t = 120 minutes when the clinician believed the initial dose was ineffective. Patients requiring more than one additional dose of analgesia were treated as nonresponders and were removed from the study. Thirty-six patients received hydromorphone and 37 received meperidine. The initial pain intensities (hydromorphone group = 8.4 +/- 1.5; meperidine group = 8.5 +/- 2.1), age distributions, sex distributions, and side effects of the two groups were comparable.

7541302,"Diagnosis of early ectopic pregnancy by measurement of the maternal serum to cul-de-sac fluid beta-hCG ratio. In patients suspected of having an ectopic pregnancy, because of a positive beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) test and a sonographically undetectable gestational sac, even laparoscopy cannot always achieve a precise diagnosis, when the gestational age is very early. This means that the patient has to be followed by repeated beta-hCG measurements and repeated laparoscopy, which are expensive and inconvenient for the patient. This paper reports on a method that is simple to perform and that will provide the clinician with valuable information about the strong likelihood of a tubal pregnancy when ultrasound and beta-hCG measurements raise the suspicion but are not diagnostic. A prerequisite for this approach is the availability of a minimal volume (1-2 ml) of peritoneal fluid in the pouch of Douglas. A total of 131 patients who had a positive beta-hCG test and an undetectable gestational sac within the uterine cavity and who had a small volume of cul-de-sac fluid were studied. The fluid was obtained transvaginally by means of an ultrasound-guided automatic puncture system. The beta-hCG level was determined in the cul-de-sac fluid and in the maternal serum, for comparison. In two cases with tubal pregnancy, concentrated viscous blood samples were aspirated and beta-hCG concentrations could not be measured for technical reasons. In 129 cases, the ratio of levels of beta-hCG between serum and cul-de-sac fluid could be measured. In 42 out of 44 patients with intrauterine pregnancy, the ratio was greater than unity; in 82 out of 85 patients with a tubal pregnancy, the ratio was less than unity. With this ratio used for detection of tubal pregnancy, the diagnostic sensitivity of the test was 95.4% and the specificity was 95.2%. The positive predictive value was 97.6% and the negative predictive value 91.3%. We conclude from these findings that the measurement of the maternal serum to cul-de-sac fluid beta-hCG ratio facilitated the early diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy in the Fallopian tube.",Gene therapy,diagnosis early ectopic pregnancy measurement maternal serum culdesac fluid betahcg ratio patient suspected ectopic pregnancy positive betahuman chorionic gonadotropin betahcg test sonographically undetectable gestational sac even laparoscopy always achieve precise diagnosis gestational age early mean patient followed repeated betahcg measurement repeated laparoscopy expensive inconvenient patient paper report method simple perform provide clinician valuable information strong likelihood tubal pregnancy ultrasound betahcg measurement raise suspicion diagnostic prerequisite approach availability minimal volume ml peritoneal fluid pouch douglas total patient positive betahcg test undetectable gestational sac within uterine cavity small volume culdesac fluid studied fluid obtained transvaginally mean ultrasoundguided automatic puncture system betahcg level determined culdesac fluid maternal serum comparison two case tubal pregnancy concentrated viscous blood sample aspirated betahcg concentration measured technical reason case ratio level betahcg serum culdesac fluid measured patient intrauterine pregnancy ratio greater unity patient tubal pregnancy ratio le unity ratio used detection tubal pregnancy diagnostic sensitivity test specificity positive predictive value negative predictive value conclude finding measurement maternal serum culdesac fluid betahcg ratio facilitated early diagnosis ectopic pregnancy fallopian tube
7541300,"The mRNA expression and in vitro production of cytokines and other proteins by hepatocytes and Kupffer cells following thermal injury. Inflammatory cytokines and acute-phase proteins are closely interrelated, and their levels of production by various cells are increased by thermal injury. It was hypothesized that burn-mediated increases in the production of TNF and IL-6 by Kupffer cells and the production of acute phase proteins by hepatocytes are paralleled by increases in the corresponding message RNA levels in these cells. The mRNA expression of the cytokines, IL-6 and TNF alpha, and acute phase proteins, alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (alpha-1 AGP), and albumin in liver tissue were determined in rats 24 h after thermal injury. Also IL-6 and TNF alpha from in vitro cultured Kupffer cells, and alpha-1 AGP and albumin from in vitro cultured hepatocytes, and the serum levels of these proteins, were determined. An increased expression of IL-6 mRNA in liver tissue from animals of the burned group was accompanied by an elevation of IL-6 released from cultured Kupffer cells and by increased serum levels of this cytokine. Thermal injury caused a decrease in TNF mRNA but no change in the production of this cytokine by Kupffer cells, and TNF could not be found in the serum. Also, an increase in alpha-1 AGP mRNA expression following thermal injury was consistent with the increase of alpha-1 AGP production by hepatocytes and with the elevated serum level of this acute phase protein. Thermal injury caused no change in albumin mRNA expression or in the in vitro production of this negative acute phase protein, however, the serum level of albumin increased. The results suggest that thermal injury may cause alterations in the cytokine and acute phase protein mRNA levels in liver, which may cause alterations in the cellular production and serum levels of the corresponding proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Gene therapy,mrna expression vitro production cytokine protein hepatocytes kupffer cell following thermal injury inflammatory cytokine acutephase protein closely interrelated level production various cell increased thermal injury hypothesized burnmediated increase production tnf il kupffer cell production acute phase protein hepatocytes paralleled increase corresponding message rna level cell mrna expression cytokine il tnf alpha acute phase protein alpha acid glycoprotein alpha agp albumin liver tissue determined rat thermal injury also il tnf alpha vitro cultured kupffer cell alpha agp albumin vitro cultured hepatocytes serum level protein determined increased expression il mrna liver tissue animal burned group accompanied elevation il released cultured kupffer cell increased serum level cytokine thermal injury caused decrease tnf mrna change production cytokine kupffer cell tnf found serum also increase alpha agp mrna expression following thermal injury consistent increase alpha agp production hepatocytes elevated serum level acute phase protein thermal injury caused change albumin mrna expression vitro production negative acute phase protein however serum level albumin increased result suggest thermal injury may cause alteration cytokine acute phase protein mrna level liver may cause alteration cellular production serum level corresponding proteinsabstract truncated word
7541295,"Uptake of radiolabeled and colloidal gold-labeled chyle chylomicrons and chylomicron remnants by rat platelets in vitro. This study examined the uptake of chyle chylomicrons (CMs) and chylomicron remnants (CMRs) by rat platelets in vitro. CMs and CMRs were doubly labeled with [3H]arachidonate ([3H]-20:4) and [14C]cholesterol and were incubated with platelets for up to 4 hours. A significant uptake (binding and/or internalization) of CMs by the platelets occurred, as indicated by the parallel increase of [3H]20:4 and [14C]cholesterol in platelets with incubation time. Addition of unlabeled CMs, VLDLs, LDLs, and HDLs decreased the uptake of labeled CMs. The competition experiments suggested that there is both a saturable binding and a nonspecific uptake of CMs. During incubation with CMs, the proportion of [3H]20:4 in phospholipids decreased and that in 1,2-x-diacylglycerol increased. The data indicated that a phospholipase C-mediated degradation of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine occurred, whereas [3H]20:4 in triglyceride and 14C in cholesterol ester did not change. Electron microscopic studies after incubation with colloidal gold-labeled CMs (CM-Au's) demonstrated an accumulation of CM-Au particles in the open canalicular system of the platelets. Some CM-Au particles were localized in cytoplasmic vacuoles that were not stained by ruthenium red. Some CM-Au's or free gold particles were in vacuoles that showed acid phosphatase activity, indicating that some true endocytosis of CM occurred. The uptake of [3H]-20:4- and [14C]cholesterol-labeled CMRs was low compared with the uptake of CMs. After incubation with colloidal gold-labeled CMRs (CMR-Au's), only a few platelets contained CMR-Au in their open canalicular systems, and no CMR-Au particles were seen in the cytoplasm or in acid phosphatase-positive vacuoles. Rat platelets can thus interact with CMs by a process that leads to a sequestration in the open canalicular system and endocytosis and a net degradation of CM phospholipids.

Using endothelium-denuded and intact rat aortic rings, we have determined the contractile and relaxant structure-activity profile for a series of thrombin receptor-derived polypeptides (TRPs) based on the human and rat receptor sequences: SFLLR (P5), SFLLR-NH2 (P5-NH2) SFFLR (Rat P5), SFFLR-NH2 (Rat P5-NH2), SFLLRNP (P7), SFLLRNP-NH2 (P7-NH2), SFFLRNP (Rat P7), SFFLRNP-NH2 (Rat P7-NH2), and SFLLRNPNDKYEPF (P14). 2. A contractile response to thrombin and the TRPs in the endothelium-denuded aortic tissue was minimal or absent in preparations obtained from animal weighing less than 180 g (< 6 weeks of age), but increased with animal size, plateauing in tissues derived from animals weighing between 320 and 420 g (about 9 to 14 weeks of age). In contrast, the contractile responses to KCl and noradrenaline did not differ in the tissues and relaxant responses to the TRPs in endothelium-intact aortic preparations were comparable for tissues obtained from either young (< or = 180 g) or older (> or = 320 g) animals. 3. The contractile response of the endothelium-denuded preparation to thrombin and the TRPs showed marked cross-desensitization: the relaxation response of the intact rings did not desensitize to the TRPs. 4. The relative potencies for the TRPs in the aortic contraction assay were comparable to those for the relaxation assay, but were distinct from the relative potencies we measured previously in a rat gastric longitudinal muscle contraction assay. Further, P5 behaved as a partial agonist in the aortic contraction assay, whereas it had been observed to be a full agonist in the gastric contraction assay. 5. The contractile activity of P5-NH2 in endothelium intact aortic rings was low or absent, but in the presence of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N omega-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME), the contractions in the intact preparation were equivalent to the response of the endothelium-denuded preparation in the absence of L-NAME.6. The contractile response of the endothelium-denuded aortic preparation to P5-NH2 was inhibited by nifedipine and the kinase C antagonist, chelerythrine, but was resistant to the action of indomethacin,tetrodotoxin and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein.7 We conclude that the receptor system for the TRPs in the aortic smooth muscle elements, responsible for the contractile response, is similar to the aortic endothelial cell receptor responsible for the relaxation response, but is distinct from the receptor that we have previously characterized in gastric longitudinal smooth muscle, results pointing to the presence of receptor subtypes in the vascular and gastric smooth muscle elements.",Gene therapy,vascular action thrombin receptorderived polypeptide structureactivity profile contractile relaxant effect rat aorta using endotheliumdenuded intact rat aortic ring determined contractile relaxant structureactivity profile series thrombin receptorderived polypeptide trps based human rat receptor sequence sfllr sfllrnh pnh sfflr rat sfflrnh rat pnh sfllrnp sfllrnpnh pnh sfflrnp rat sfflrnpnh rat pnh sfllrnpndkyepf contractile response thrombin trps endotheliumdenuded aortic tissue minimal absent preparation obtained animal weighing le week age increased animal size plateauing tissue derived animal weighing week age contrast contractile response kcl noradrenaline differ tissue relaxant response trps endotheliumintact aortic preparation comparable tissue obtained either young older animal contractile response endotheliumdenuded preparation thrombin trps showed marked crossdesensitization relaxation response intact ring desensitize trps relative potency trps aortic contraction assay comparable relaxation assay distinct relative potency measured previously rat gastric longitudinal muscle contraction assay behaved partial agonist aortic contraction assay whereas observed full agonist gastric contraction assay contractile activity pnh endothelium intact aortic ring low absent presence nitric oxide synthase inhibitor omeganitrolargininemethyl ester lname contraction intact preparation equivalent response endotheliumdenuded preparation absence lname contractile response endotheliumdenuded aortic preparation pnh inhibited nifedipine kinase antagonist chelerythrine resistant action indomethacintetrodotoxin tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein conclude receptor system trps aortic smooth muscle element responsible contractile response similar aortic endothelial cell receptor responsible relaxation response distinct receptor previously characterized gastric longitudinal smooth muscle result pointing presence receptor subtypes vascular gastric smooth muscle element

The expression of cytokeratins (CK) 19, 8, 18, 13, 10 and 7 was examined in 35 cases of squamous cell carcinomas of the oesophagus (10 well-differentiated, 13 moderately-differentiated, and 12 poorly-differentiated) and the adjacent mucosa by means of a panel of monoclonal antibodies on frozen sections. The study was undertaken to assess the pattern of expression of these keratins in oesophageal tumours and its relation to the degree of differentiation. The normal oesophageal epithelia expressed CK19 in 86%, CK18 in 17% and CK13 in 14% of cases. CK8, CK10 and CK7 immunoreactivity was not observed. The tumours expressed CK19 in 86%, CK8 in 46%, CK18 in 97%, CK13 in 83%, CK10 in 34% and CK7 in 29% of cases. Thus, the so-called simple epithelial markers CK18 and CK19 occurred in the majority of oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas. CK13 (the so-called non-keratinizing squamous epithelial marker) was only infrequently demonstrated in the non-neoplastic oesophageal mucosa, and its expression was more frequent in carcinomas. CK10 was not demonstrated in non-neoplastic mucosa, but was mostly associated with well-differentiated carcinomas. We therefore conclude that the pattern of expression of cytokeratins in oesophageal carcinomas is different from that in normal oesophageal epithelia and varies with differentiation.",Gene therapy,cytokeratin expression nonneoplastic oesophageal epithelium squamous cell carcinoma oesophagus expression cytokeratins ck examined case squamous cell carcinoma oesophagus welldifferentiated moderatelydifferentiated poorlydifferentiated adjacent mucosa mean panel monoclonal antibody frozen section study undertaken ass pattern expression keratin oesophageal tumour relation degree differentiation normal oesophageal epithelium expressed ck ck ck case ck ck ck immunoreactivity observed tumour expressed ck ck ck ck ck ck case thus socalled simple epithelial marker ck ck occurred majority oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma ck socalled nonkeratinizing squamous epithelial marker infrequently demonstrated nonneoplastic oesophageal mucosa expression frequent carcinoma ck demonstrated nonneoplastic mucosa mostly associated welldifferentiated carcinoma therefore conclude pattern expression cytokeratins oesophageal carcinoma different normal oesophageal epithelium varies differentiation

L-trans-Pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (L-t-PDC) and L-threo-3- hydroxyaspartate (L-t-3OHA), compounds known to interact strongly with the Na(+)-dependent high affinity uptake of excitatory amino acids in central nervous tissue, were tested as potential inhibitors of binding to glutamate receptors and transport sites in frozen sections of rat brain. [3H] alpha-amino-3-hydroxy- 5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA), [3H]6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), and [3H] kainate were used as ligands for the binding sites on the ""non-NMDA"" classes of glutamate receptors and [3H]DL-(E)-2-amino-4-propyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoate (CGP 39653) was used to label NMDA receptor binding sites. The Na(+)-dependent glutamate-uptake site was marked by [3H]L-aspartate. The autoradiograms, obtained by exposing 3H-sensitive film to sections of rat forebrain preincubated with 3H-labelled ligands, were scanned by laser beam and quantified. Distribution patterns of the receptor and transporter sites visualized by the 3H-labelled ligands were compatible with previously published results. [3H]CNQX binding, however, was found to be significantly decreased by Na+.L-t-3OHA was about an order of magnitude stronger than L-t-PDC as an inhibitor of [3H]L-aspartate binding. Neither of the compounds had any important effect at the ""non-NMDA"" receptor binding sites but L-t-3OHA was a weak inhibitor of [3H]CGP 39653 binding (< 40% at 100 microM). The results suggest that, at low nanomolar concentrations, both compounds are likely to be selective for Na(+)-dependent high affinity glutamate transporter sites. Moreover, L-t-3OHA seems to have a sufficiently high affinity for the site to be almost certainly useful, if available in a 3H-labelled form, as a ligand in autoradiographic studies.",Gene therapy,effect ltranspyrrolidinedicarboxylate lthreohydroxyaspartate binding hlaspartate halphaaminohydroxymethylisoxazolepropionate ampa hdleaminopropylphosphonopentenoate cgp hcyanonitroquinoxalinedione cnqx hkainate studied autoradiography rat forebrain ltranspyrrolidinedicarboxylate ltpdc lthreo hydroxyaspartate ltoha compound known interact strongly nadependent high affinity uptake excitatory amino acid central nervous tissue tested potential inhibitor binding glutamate receptor transport site frozen section rat brain alphaaminohydroxy methylisoxazolepropionate ampa hcyanonitroquinoxalinedione cnqx kainate used ligand binding site nonnmda class glutamate receptor hdleaminopropylphosphonopentenoate cgp used label nmda receptor binding site nadependent glutamateuptake site marked hlaspartate autoradiograms obtained exposing hsensitive film section rat forebrain preincubated hlabelled ligand scanned laser beam quantified distribution pattern receptor transporter site visualized hlabelled ligand compatible previously published result hcnqx binding however found significantly decreased naltoha order magnitude stronger ltpdc inhibitor hlaspartate binding neither compound important effect nonnmda receptor binding site ltoha weak inhibitor hcgp binding microm result suggest low nanomolar concentration compound likely selective nadependent high affinity glutamate transporter site moreover ltoha seems sufficiently high affinity site almost certainly useful available hlabelled form ligand autoradiographic study
7541245,"Identification and evaluation of the role of endogenous tyrosine kinases in azoxymethane induction of proliferative processes in the colonic mucosa of rats. Although tyrosine kinases (Tyr-k) are known to play a role in regulating proliferation of normal, preneoplastic and neoplastic cells, little is known about the identity of different species of Tyr-k involved in this process. Utilizing a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system, in which the separated proteins from tissue extracts are assayed directly for Tyr-k, we attempted to identify the species of Tyr-k that may be involved in azoxymethane (AOM) induction of colonic mucosal ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, an enzyme whose activity is known to rise in rapidly proliferating cells. We have observed that 5 days after a single injection of the colonic carcinogen AOM (20 mg/kg body wt) to 3-4-month old rats, a significant 230% rise in colonic mucosal proliferative activity (as evidenced by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) immunoreactivity) was also accompanied by a 550% increase in ODC activity. This was also associated with a marked rise (140-240%) in the relative activity of Tyr-k of three mucosal proteins with MI of 165, 145 and 125 kDa. Since the molecular mass of one of the Tyr-k (165 kDa) corresponded to that of EGF-receptor (EGF-R), this led us to examine the role of EGF-R Tyr-k in AOM induction of colonic mucosal ODC. We observed that a 320% increase in mucosal ODC activity, 5 days after AOM injection, was accompanied by over 200% rise in Tyr-k activity of EGF-R. Daily injection of tyrphostin (300 micrograms/kg body wt.), a Tyr-k inhibitor with a higher specificity for EGF-R Tyr-k, significantly attenuated AOM-induced stimulation of both ODC and Tyr-k activity of EGF-R. Administration of AOM also stimulated the rate of synthesis and secretion of TGF-alpha in isolated colonocytes. In addition, the levels of TGF-alpha and its mRNA in the colonic mucosa were also found to be 100% and 250% higher, respectively, in AOM-treated rats when compared with the controls. We suggest that (a) activation of intrinsic Tyr-k of EGF-R is an important event in AOM induction of colonic mucosal proliferative processes, and (b) this activation is thought to be mediated by TGF-alpha through an autocrine mechanism.",Gene therapy,identification evaluation role endogenous tyrosine kinase azoxymethane induction proliferative process colonic mucosa rat although tyrosine kinase tyrk known play role regulating proliferation normal preneoplastic neoplastic cell little known identity different specie tyrk involved process utilizing nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system separated protein tissue extract assayed directly tyrk attempted identify specie tyrk may involved azoxymethane aom induction colonic mucosal ornithine decarboxylase odc activity enzyme whose activity known rise rapidly proliferating cell observed day single injection colonic carcinogen aom mgkg body wt month old rat significant rise colonic mucosal proliferative activity evidenced bromodeoxyuridine brdu immunoreactivity also accompanied increase odc activity also associated marked rise relative activity tyrk three mucosal protein mi kda since molecular mass one tyrk kda corresponded egfreceptor egfr led u examine role egfr tyrk aom induction colonic mucosal odc observed increase mucosal odc activity day aom injection accompanied rise tyrk activity egfr daily injection tyrphostin microgramskg body wt tyrk inhibitor higher specificity egfr tyrk significantly attenuated aominduced stimulation odc tyrk activity egfr administration aom also stimulated rate synthesis secretion tgfalpha isolated colonocytes addition level tgfalpha mrna colonic mucosa also found higher respectively aomtreated rat compared control suggest activation intrinsic tyrk egfr important event aom induction colonic mucosal proliferative process activation thought mediated tgfalpha autocrine mechanism
7541222,"Regulation of nitric oxide release by macrophages after intratracheal lipopolysaccharide. We investigated the effect of intratracheal (i.t.) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on alveolar macrophage release of nitric oxide. Mice received i.t. LPS at doses ranging from 1 to 100 micrograms/100 g body weight and were killed at serial intervals for bronchoalveolar lavage. Control mice received i.t. phosphate-buffered saline. We found that after i.t. LPS, there was an early (1 to 3 days) influx of neutrophils followed by a later (5 to 7 days) influx of macrophages into the lungs. Alveolar macrophages lavaged from mice given i.t. LPS did not spontaneously release nitric oxide (measured as nitrite), but the capacity of these cells to release nitric oxide in vitro in response to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or LPS was markedly upregulated. Alveolar macrophages lavaged from mice given i.t. LPS but not i.t. phosphate-buffered saline also expressed mRNA for inducible nitric oxide synthase as measured by semiquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. To investigate possible mechanisms for cellular priming for increased nitric oxide release after i.t. LPS, mice were depleted of CD4+ lymphocytes with an anti-CD4 antibody. Alveolar macrophages from CD4-depleted mice given i.t. LPS released significantly less nitric oxide in vitro in comparison to macrophages from nondepleted mice. Additional mice were treated with neutralizing doses of anti-tumor necrosis factor or anti-IFN-gamma antibody before i.t. LPS. Pretreatment with each cytokine antibody decreased but did not eliminate macrophage priming for nitric oxide release after i.t. LPS.

7541054,"Cloning of myelin basic protein-reactive T cells from the experimental allergic encephalomyelitis-resistant rat strain, LER. Rats of the LER inbred strain are resistant to the active induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), although they are susceptible to adoptively transferred EAE when they are injected with encephalitogenic T cells from EAE-susceptible Lewis rats. The mechanism of resistance remains to be elucidated. We report here that myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cells can be cloned from LER rats immunized with MBP, that these CD4+ LER T cells can recognize the encephalitogenic peptide (MBP-EP) and will divide vigorously when it is presented to them, and that these T cells bear V beta 8 + TCR chains. Nevertheless, in contrast to Lewis T cells with the same specificity and TCR beta chains, LER T cells from MBP-EP-specific clones cannot induce EAE when adoptively transferred into naive rats of either strain.

We examined the effects of maternal dietary protein restriction on fetal growth and expression of IGF-I and -II, and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP). We sought to dissociate the respective effects of maternal protein versus calorie restriction on growth indices and IGF synthesis by the neonates of protein-restricted dams.

The current study was designed to investigate the lymph node accumulation mechanisms of dextran-coated ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (USPIO) in rats. The iron deposition in the lymph nodes after intravenous administration of USPIO at a dose of 200 mumol Fe/kg was measured in vitro by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer in control rats, in rats after depletion of complement C3, after induction of antidextran antibodies, and with prior ligation of afferent lymphatic vessels. The results were correlated with baseline iron concentration and histology. A significant increase in iron concentration but unequal distribution between central and peripheral nodes occurred after administration of USPIO in rats. Much less accumulation was observed in guinea pigs. In rats, the nodal uptake of USPIO was not impaired by depletion of complement C3 using cobra venom factor. The central lymph nodes (mesenteric nodes) showed significantly more accumulation of iron particles in the presence of antidextran antibodies induced by dextran preimmunization. Afferent lymphatic vessel ligation did not effect iron particle accumulation.

7540155,"Steel factor directs melanocyte development in vitro through selective regulation of the number of c-kit+ progenitors. Studies of mice containing mutations in the genes for a receptor tyrosine kinase, c-kit, or its cognate ligand, Steel factor (SLF), establish that this signaling pathway is required for the development of melanocytes from their precursors in the embryonic neural crest (NC). In order to define the mechanism of this requirement, we have labeled cells expressing c-kit with an anti-c-kit antibody (ACK2) and studied the action of SLF on these cells in cultures of murine trunk NC. c-kit positive (c-kit+) cells first appeared after 2 days in culture and were morphologically indistinguishable from other NC cells. These cells subsequently expressed tyrosinase-related protein, an early marker for the melanocyte lineage, and became pigmented in the presence of a phorbol ester. Further, elimination of the c-kit+ population, by incubating the cultures in ACK2, resulted in the ablation of the melanocyte population, but had no effect on the generation of other neural crest derivatives. These data indicate that c-kit+ cells arising from the neural crest are melanocyte progenitors. The addition of SLF to these cultures stimulated an increase in the number of c-kit+ cells, and further studies indicated that SLF acts as both a survival and a proliferative factor for c-kit+ cells. These findings provide a mechanism of regulation of melanocyte development, whereby c-kit is exclusively expressed by melanocyte progenitors within the neural crest precursor population, and subsequent survival and proliferation of these progenitors is regulated by SLF.",Gene therapy,steel factor directs melanocyte development vitro selective regulation number ckit progenitor study mouse containing mutation gene receptor tyrosine kinase ckit cognate ligand steel factor slf establish signaling pathway required development melanocyte precursor embryonic neural crest nc order define mechanism requirement labeled cell expressing ckit antickit antibody ack studied action slf cell culture murine trunk nc ckit positive ckit cell first appeared day culture morphologically indistinguishable nc cell cell subsequently expressed tyrosinaserelated protein early marker melanocyte lineage became pigmented presence phorbol ester elimination ckit population incubating culture ack resulted ablation melanocyte population effect generation neural crest derivative data indicate ckit cell arising neural crest melanocyte progenitor addition slf culture stimulated increase number ckit cell study indicated slf act survival proliferative factor ckit cell finding provide mechanism regulation melanocyte development whereby ckit exclusively expressed melanocyte progenitor within neural crest precursor population subsequent survival proliferation progenitor regulated slf

The finding that endometrial maturation may be delayed following hormone replacement therapy has suggested that a generalised endometrial dysfunction may exist in ovum recipients. In order to investigate this suggestion further, circulating levels of IGFBP-1 were measured in samples taken throughout pregnancies conceived either spontaneously or following ovum donation. When analysed at two-weekly intervals, the serum levels of IGFBP-1 in ovum donation pregnancies failed to show the expected peak towards the end of the first trimester and were significantly reduced at week ten (U = 364.5, p = 0.0002) and twelve (U = 138.0, p = 0.0047). For the remainder of pregnancy, circulating IGFBP-1 levels were similar in both groups.

7540151,"Identification of Rab3-, Rab5a- and synaptobrevin II-like proteins in a preparation of rat kidney vesicles containing the vasopressin-regulated water channel. According to the 'shuttle hypothesis', vasopressin increases the water permeability of renal epithelial cells by exocytotic fusion of vesicles containing the water channel AQP-CD with the apical plasma membrane, whereas withdrawal of vasopressin results in endocytotic uptake of AQP-CD. The proteins involved in the redistribution of AQP-CD have not been identified. With a panel of monoclonal antibodies, we detected Rab3-, Rab5a- and synaptobrevin II-like proteins in a kidney preparation enriched in AQP-CD-containing vesicles. The synaptobrevin II-like proteins is not identical with the ubiquitous cellubrevin. Rab3- and synaptobrevin II- but not Rab5a-like proteins were co-enriched with AQP-CD.

7540149,"Nitric oxide synthase activity in molluscan hemocytes. The hemocytes of the freshwater snail Viviparus ater have nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, as demonstrated by [3H]citrulline and nitrite + nitrate formation. The enzyme is NADPH dependent and is competitively inhibited by the mammalian NOS inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (Ki = 4.7 microM). The Km for L-arginine is 2.5 microM. 70% of the total activity is observed at very low free Ca2+ concentration (3 nM). LPS treatment increased total NOS activity 2.4 fold. The activity is partly present in the non-soluble fraction of hemocytes (24% and 8% in non-stimulated and LPS-stimulated snails, respectively). An antiserum to the C-terminal synthetic pentadecapeptide of the rat cerebellar NOS inhibited the enzyme activity in a concentration-dependent manner.

7540147,"Priming and treatment with molgramostim (rhGM-CSF) in adult high-risk acute myeloid leukemia during induction chemotherapy: a prospective, randomized pilot study. In a randomized study of 18 adult patients with high-risk or advanced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) we investigated the effect of supplementing conventional induction chemotherapy with recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF). For comparison, a historical control group of 90 patients treated for de novo AML with conventional chemotherapy during the previous period, 1984-1990, was also analyzed. Before induction chemotherapy, 10 patients were randomized to receiving rhGM-CSF, starting on day 1 to 3 before chemotherapy and continued for a maximum of 21 days after the start of induction treatment. Fatal complications and treatment outcome did not differ between the study groups and historical controls. Nor were there any differences between the groups in terms of hematological toxicity, e.g. time to three-lineage regeneration and need for supportive therapy. However, sequential weekly bone marrow examinations revealed a prolonged reduction of the relative number of myeloid (CD33-positive) marrow cells in the rhGM-CSF treated group. Although the small number of patients studied may not permit a definite conclusion, this randomized study did not demonstrate major beneficial effects of combining rhGM-CSF with standard induction chemotherapy in high-risk patients with AML.",Gene therapy,priming treatment molgramostim rhgmcsf adult highrisk acute myeloid leukemia induction chemotherapy prospective randomized pilot study randomized study adult patient highrisk advanced acute myeloid leukemia aml investigated effect supplementing conventional induction chemotherapy recombinant human granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor rhgmcsf comparison historical control group patient treated de novo aml conventional chemotherapy previous period also analyzed induction chemotherapy patient randomized receiving rhgmcsf starting day chemotherapy continued maximum day start induction treatment fatal complication treatment outcome differ study group historical control difference group term hematological toxicity eg time threelineage regeneration need supportive therapy however sequential weekly bone marrow examination revealed prolonged reduction relative number myeloid cdpositive marrow cell rhgmcsf treated group although small number patient studied may permit definite conclusion randomized study demonstrate major beneficial effect combining rhgmcsf standard induction chemotherapy highrisk patient aml
7540145,"Effects of Ca2+ channel antagonist subtypes on mitochondrial Ca2+ transport. This study was carried out to define the effects of various Ca2+ channel modulatory drugs on mitochondrial Ca2+ movements. Bovine adrenal medulla mitochondria took up Ca2+ at an initial rate of 6.8 nmol mg protein-1 5 s-1, with a Km of 15 microM and a Bmax of 30 nmol mg protein-1. At 30 microM, neither verapamil, diltiazem, nitrendipine nor Bay K 8644 [methyl-1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3-nitro-4-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl)- pyridine-5-carboxylate] affected the initial rate of Ca2+ uptake. Ca(2+)-loaded mitochondria retained their Ca2+ contents in the presence of ruthenium red for at least 30 min. Cinnarizine and flunarizine, but not verapamil, diltiazem, isradipine, Bay K 8644 or nitrendipine, caused a fast and dramatic Na(+)-independent Ca2+ loss.

The Na(+)-dependent Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria was completely inhibited by diltiazem and greatly blocked by nitrendipine. Isradipine caused a moderate blockade and Bay K 8644 and verapamil had no effect.

7540143,Structural requirements for neuropeptide Y in mast cell and G protein activation. Incubation of neuropeptide Y or its C-terminal fragments with rat peritoneal mast cells resulted in a dose-dependent histamine release. Fragment 18-36 of neuropeptide Y was the most biologically active peptide. EC25 value on rat mast cells was 7.2 +/- 2.2 nM. Neuropeptide Y was also able to induce a flare response after intradermal injection in humans. The histamine releasing effects of neuropeptide Y related peptides were greatly inhibited by pretreatment of rat mast cells with pertussis toxin or benzalkonium chloride. Neuropeptide Y and C-terminal related peptides also stimulated the GTPase activity of purified heterotrimeric G proteins in a dose-dependent manner from 1 to 50 microM. Binding studies with [125I]neuropeptide Y were unable to provide evidence for the presence of specific binding sites on the surface of mast cells. The alpha helical conformation of neuropeptide Y fragments was studied by measuring the circular dichroism spectra. Neuropeptide Y-(18-36) was the smallest fragment having a strong helical conformation. Our results demonstrate that neuropeptide Y activates mast cells through a non-specific process leading to G protein activation.,Gene therapy,structural requirement neuropeptide mast cell protein activation incubation neuropeptide cterminal fragment rat peritoneal mast cell resulted dosedependent histamine release fragment neuropeptide biologically active peptide ec value rat mast cell nm neuropeptide also able induce flare response intradermal injection human histamine releasing effect neuropeptide related peptide greatly inhibited pretreatment rat mast cell pertussis toxin benzalkonium chloride neuropeptide cterminal related peptide also stimulated gtpase activity purified heterotrimeric protein dosedependent manner microm binding study ineuropeptide unable provide evidence presence specific binding site surface mast cell alpha helical conformation neuropeptide fragment studied measuring circular dichroism spectrum neuropeptide smallest fragment strong helical conformation result demonstrate neuropeptide activates mast cell nonspecific process leading protein activation

The in vitro responses of longitudinal preparations of rat stomach fundus and ileum to capsaicin at 1, 8, 4, 16 and 26 weeks and to substance P at 1 and 8 weeks from diabetes induction were studied. The results were compared with those obtained in age-matched control rats. The contractile responses to exogenous substance P and capsaicin were not affected in the stomach fundus from diabetic rats. Atropine (1 microM) did not antagonize the substance P-induced response whereas it inhibited about 90% of the capsaicin-induced response in controls and about 60% of the response in diabetic rats. At the resting tone, capsaicin induced a relaxation followed by a contraction in stomach fundus of control rats. Only a contraction was evoked in diabetic rats. In carbachol (0.05-0.1 microM) pre-stimulated strips, a complete restoration of the biphasic response was obtained in the diabetic state. The contractile response elicited by exogenous substance P was not significantly increased in the ileum preparations from diabetic rats; nevertheless the EC50 value for substance P was reduced 8 weeks after the onset of diabetes. The response elicited by capsaicin in the ileum of control rats was also biphasic. The capsaicin-induced contraction was greater in tissue from diabetic rats as compared with controls and relaxation was not evident. An age-related decrease of the contraction was also evident in both groups. Atropine (1 microM) partially antagonized the responses to substance P and capsaicin. The inhibition of the responses with atropine was more evident in control than in diabetic rats. These results suggest that the myogenic actions of several agonists in these two tissues are differently modified in experimental diabetes.",Gene therapy,effect substance capsaicin stomach fundus ileum streptozotocindiabetic rat vitro response longitudinal preparation rat stomach fundus ileum capsaicin week substance week diabetes induction studied result compared obtained agematched control rat contractile response exogenous substance capsaicin affected stomach fundus diabetic rat atropine microm antagonize substance pinduced response whereas inhibited capsaicininduced response control response diabetic rat resting tone capsaicin induced relaxation followed contraction stomach fundus control rat contraction evoked diabetic rat carbachol microm prestimulated strip complete restoration biphasic response obtained diabetic state contractile response elicited exogenous substance significantly increased ileum preparation diabetic rat nevertheless ec value substance reduced week onset diabetes response elicited capsaicin ileum control rat also biphasic capsaicininduced contraction greater tissue diabetic rat compared control relaxation evident agerelated decrease contraction also evident group atropine microm partially antagonized response substance capsaicin inhibition response atropine evident control diabetic rat result suggest myogenic action several agonist two tissue differently modified experimental diabetes
7540137,"Site-specific crosslinking of 4-thiouridine-modified human tRNA(3Lys) to reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus type I. We have mapped specific RNA-protein contacts between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type I reverse transcriptase (RT) and its natural primer, human tRNA(3Lys), using a site-specific crosslinking strategy. Four different tRNA(3Lys) constructs with a single 32P-labeled 4-thiouridine (4-thioU) residue at positions -1, 16, 36 or 41 were synthesized. After incubation with RT followed by irradiation, crosslinks were localized to either the p66 or p51 subunit of RT by digestion with nuclease and SDS gel fractionation. 4-thioU at position -1 or 16 transferred label to the p66 subunit almost exclusively (> 90%), whereas position 36 labeled both p66 and p51 (3:1). Position 41 yielded no detectable crosslinks. The region of p66 contacted by position -1 of tRNA(3Lys) was localized to the 203 C-terminal amino acids of RT by CNBr cleavage, whereas a 127 amino acid-CNBr peptide (residues 230-357) from both p66 and p51 was labeled by position 36. Functionality of the 4-thioU-modified tRNA(3Lys)(-1) crosslinked to RT in the presence of an RNA but not a DNA template was demonstrated by the ability of the tRNA to be extended. These results localize the 5' half of the tRNA on the interface between the two RT subunits, closer to the RNase H domain than to the polymerase active site, in accord with previous suggestions. They argue further that a specific binding site for the 5' end of the primer tRNA(3Lys) may exist within the C-terminal portion of the p66 subunit, which could be important for the initiation of reverse transcription.",Gene therapy,sitespecific crosslinking thiouridinemodified human trnalys reverse transcriptase human immunodeficiency virus type mapped specific rnaprotein contact human immunodeficiency virus hiv type reverse transcriptase rt natural primer human trnalys using sitespecific crosslinking strategy four different trnalys construct single plabeled thiouridine thiou residue position synthesized incubation rt followed irradiation crosslinks localized either subunit rt digestion nuclease sd gel fractionation thiou position transferred label subunit almost exclusively whereas position labeled position yielded detectable crosslinks region contacted position trnalys localized cterminal amino acid rt cnbr cleavage whereas amino acidcnbr peptide residue labeled position functionality thioumodified trnalys crosslinked rt presence rna dna template demonstrated ability trna extended result localize half trna interface two rt subunit closer rnase domain polymerase active site accord previous suggestion argue specific binding site end primer trnalys may exist within cterminal portion subunit important initiation reverse transcription
7540135,"Secretion by Trypanosoma cruzi of a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase involved in cell infection. Macrophage infectivity potentiators are membrane proteins described as virulence factors in bacterial intracellular parasites, such as Legionella and Chlamydia. These factors share amino acid homology to eukaryotic peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases that are inhibited by FK506, an inhibitor of signal transduction in mammalian cells with potent immunosuppressor activity. We report here the characterization of a protein released into the culture medium by the infective stage of the protozoan intracellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The protein possesses a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity that is inhibited by FK506 and its non-immunosuppressing derivative L-685,818. The corresponding gene presents sequence homology with bacterial macrophage infectivity potentiators. The addition of the protein, produced heterologously in Escherichia coli, to cultures of trypomastigotes and simian epithelial or HeLa cells enhances invasion of the mammalian cells by the parasites. Antibodies raised in mice against the T.cruzi isomerase greatly reduce infectivity. A similar reduction of infectivity is obtained by addition to the cultures of FK506 and L-685,818.

7540133,"A change in gating mode leading to increased intrinsic Cl- channel activity compensates for defective processing in a cystic fibrosis mutant corresponding to a mild form of the disease. The effects of the mild cystic fibrosis (CF) mutation P574H were analysed and compared with those of three severe ones (delta I507, delta F508 and R560T). Immunochemical and functional analyses indicate that the rank order of CFTR expression at the cell surface is: wild type CFTR > P574H > delta F508 > R560T approximately 0. Patch-clamp analysis indicates that the open probability of P574H Cl- channels is almost twice as high as that of the wild type CFTR-Cl- channel. This increased intrinsic activity of individual P574H CFTR-Cl- channels compensates for the lower number of P574H CFTR-Cl- channels reaching the cell surface, and probably explains the milder form of CF associated with the P574H mutation. NS004, a recently described activator, restores near normal CFTR activity in cells expressing the P574H-CFTR channel. The P574H mutation modifies the gating mode of the channel with a large increase (approximately x 7) in the mean channel open time. Proline 574 might play an important role in the process connecting ATP hydrolysis at the nucleotide binding domain and opening and closing events of the CFTR-Cl- channel.",Gene therapy,change gating mode leading increased intrinsic cl channel activity compensates defective processing cystic fibrosis mutant corresponding mild form disease effect mild cystic fibrosis cf mutation ph analysed compared three severe one delta delta rt immunochemical functional analysis indicate rank order cftr expression cell surface wild type cftr ph delta rt approximately patchclamp analysis indicates open probability ph cl channel almost twice high wild type cftrcl channel increased intrinsic activity individual ph cftrcl channel compensates lower number ph cftrcl channel reaching cell surface probably explains milder form cf associated ph mutation n recently described activator restores near normal cftr activity cell expressing phcftr channel ph mutation modifies gating mode channel large increase approximately mean channel open time proline might play important role process connecting atp hydrolysis nucleotide binding domain opening closing event cftrcl channel

7540127,"Protective effects of endothelin-1 on acute pancreatitis in rats. Endothelin-1, a 21-residue peptide isolated from vascular endothelial cells, has a broad spectrum of actions. To clarify the involvement of endothelin-1 in acute pancreatitis, we examined the effects of endothelin-1 and its receptor antagonist BQ-123 on cerulein-induced pancreatitis in rats. Rats were infused intravenously with heparin-saline (control), endothelin-1 (100 pmol/kg/hr), cerulein (5 micrograms/kg/hr), or cerulein plus endothelin-1 for 3.5 hr. In another experiment, cerulein or cerulein plus BQ-123 (3 mg/kg/hr) was infused. Infusion of cerulein caused hyperamylasemia and pancreatic edema. Endothelin-1, when infused with cerulein, decreased the extent of pancreatic edema with a significant increase in the pancreatic dry- to wet-weight ratio. Histological changes induced by cerulein were markedly attenuated when endothelin-1 was given with cerulein. In contrast, endothelin-receptor blockade with BQ-123 further augmented pancreatic edema caused by cerulein. The extent of inflammatory cell infiltration was greater than BQ-123 was given with cerulein. Endothelin-1 or BQ-123 had no influence on hyperamylasemia.

7540119,"[Modifications of gene expression by tumor promoters]. The modifications of gene expression by tumor promoters were analyzed in vitro and in vivo. The results of slot blot hybridizations showed that tumor promoter TPA induced c-fos and c-myc expressions in mouse fibroblast cell line BALB/3T3 and rat liver, decreased the levels of Rb RNA in BALB/3T3 cell line and of alpha 1-I3 RNA in rat liver. It was also demonstrated that tumor promoter phenobarbital influenced c-fos and c-myc expressions and decreased alpha 1I3 mRNA level in rat liver during a long term experiment. Phenobarbital was found to have no effect on c-fos and c-myc expressions in rat liver during a short experiment. Tumor promoters induced the expressions of c-fos and c-myc which were positively-related to cancer formation and inhibited the expressions of Rb and alpha 1-I3 which were negatively-related to cancer formation.

Five unrelated children are described with a rare autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) characterized by massive nonmalignant lymphadenopathy, autoimmune phenomena, and expanded populations of TCR-CD3+CD4-CD8- lymphocytes. These findings, suggesting a genetic defect in the ability of T lymphocytes to respond to normal immunoregulatory mechanisms, prompted an evaluation of lymphocyte apoptosis. Each child had defective Fas-mediated T lymphocyte apoptosis associated with a unique, deleterious Fas gene mutation. One mutation appeared to cause a simple loss of function; however, four others had a dominant negative phenotype when coexpressed with normal Fas.

7540113,"Localization of CD44, the hyaluronate receptor, on the plasma membrane of osteocytes and osteoclasts in rat tibiae. CD44 is a multifunctional adhesion molecule that binds to hyaluronic acid, type I collagen, and fibronectin. We have studied the immunohistochemical localization of CD44 in bone cells by confocal laser scanning microscopy and transmission electron microscopy in order to clarify its role in the cell-cell and/or cell-matrix interaction of bone cells. In round osteoblasts attached to bone surfaces, immunoreactivity is restricted to their cytoplasmic processes. On the other hand, osteocytes in bone matrices show intense immunoreactivity on their plasma membrane. Intense immunoreactivity for CD44 can be detected on the basolateral plasma membranes of osteoclasts. There is considerably less reactivity observed in the area of the plasma membrane that is in direct contact with bone. The pre-embedding electron-microscopical method has revealed that CD44 is mainly localized on the basolateral plasma membrane of osteoclasts. However, the ruffled border and clear zone show little immunoreactivity. A CD44-positive reaction can be detected on both plasma membranes in the contact region between osteoclasts and osteocytes. These findings suggest that: 1) cells of the osteoblast lineage express CD44 in accordance with their morphological changes from osteoblasts into osteocytes; 2) osteoclasts express CD44 on their basolateral plasma membrane; 3) CD44 in osteoclasts and osteocytes may play an important role in cell-cell and/or cell-matrix attachment via extracellular matrices.",Gene therapy,localization cd hyaluronate receptor plasma membrane osteocyte osteoclast rat tibia cd multifunctional adhesion molecule bind hyaluronic acid type collagen fibronectin studied immunohistochemical localization cd bone cell confocal laser scanning microscopy transmission electron microscopy order clarify role cellcell andor cellmatrix interaction bone cell round osteoblast attached bone surface immunoreactivity restricted cytoplasmic process hand osteocyte bone matrix show intense immunoreactivity plasma membrane intense immunoreactivity cd detected basolateral plasma membrane osteoclast considerably le reactivity observed area plasma membrane direct contact bone preembedding electronmicroscopical method revealed cd mainly localized basolateral plasma membrane osteoclast however ruffled border clear zone show little immunoreactivity cdpositive reaction detected plasma membrane contact region osteoclast osteocyte finding suggest cell osteoblast lineage express cd accordance morphological change osteoblast osteocyte osteoclast express cd basolateral plasma membrane cd osteoclast osteocyte may play important role cellcell andor cellmatrix attachment via extracellular matrix
7540111,"Attenuation of the reflex responses to muscle contraction by the coadministration of antagonists to substance P and somatostatin into the dorsal horn. The aim was to determine if the coadministration of antagonists to substance P and somatostatin into the L7 dorsal horn blunts the reflex cardiovascular responses to static contraction to a greater extent than each antagonist alone. The possibility that this attenuation is mediated by blunting the contraction evoked increases in sympathetic outflow was also tested. Using alpha chloralose anaesthetised cats (n = 8), static contraction and stretch of the triceps surae muscle were performed before and after microinjecting (1 microliter) 250 ng of the substance P antagonist, D-Pro2-D-Phe7-D-Trp9-substance P, and the somatostatin antagonist, cyclo(7-amino-heptanoyl-phenylalanyl-D-tryptophyl-lysyl-threonyl-[ benzyl]). The muscle was contracted by electrically stimulating the peripheral end of the cut L7 ventral root. Before injecting the antagonists, static muscle contraction increased mean arterial blood pressure by 40(SEM 6) mm Hg, heart rate by 13(2) beats.min-1, and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) by 41(7)%. These changes were blunted by the antagonists since the increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and RSNA were reduced to 21(3) mm Hg, 8(1) beats.min-1, and 23(5)%, respectively. In contrast, antagonist administration did not affect the pressor [33(5) v 31(5) mm Hg], heart rate [9(2) v 10(2) beats.min-1], or RSNA [23(4)% v 25(5)%] responses to muscle stretch. Microinjection of 2% lignocaine into the dorsal horn virtually abolished the reflex changes elicited by muscle stretch. The release of substance P and somatostatin in the spinal cord plays a role in mediating the cardiovascular changes caused by static contraction, but the release of other neurotransmitters/neuromodulators is also involved. The attenuation produced by these antagonists is mediated, at least in part, by reducing sympathetic outflow.",Gene therapy,attenuation reflex response muscle contraction coadministration antagonist substance somatostatin dorsal horn aim determine coadministration antagonist substance somatostatin dorsal horn blunts reflex cardiovascular response static contraction greater extent antagonist alone possibility attenuation mediated blunting contraction evoked increase sympathetic outflow also tested using alpha chloralose anaesthetised cat static contraction stretch triceps surae muscle performed microinjecting microliter ng substance antagonist dprodphedtrpsubstance somatostatin antagonist cycloaminoheptanoylphenylalanyldtryptophyllysylthreonyl benzyl muscle contracted electrically stimulating peripheral end cut ventral root injecting antagonist static muscle contraction increased mean arterial blood pressure sem mm hg heart rate beatsmin renal sympathetic nerve activity rsna change blunted antagonist since increase blood pressure heart rate rsna reduced mm hg beatsmin respectively contrast antagonist administration affect pressor mm hg heart rate beatsmin rsna response muscle stretch microinjection lignocaine dorsal horn virtually abolished reflex change elicited muscle stretch release substance somatostatin spinal cord play role mediating cardiovascular change caused static contraction release neurotransmittersneuromodulators also involved attenuation produced antagonist mediated least part reducing sympathetic outflow

7540107,"Immunological responses in human papillomavirus 16 E6/E7-transgenic mice to E7 protein correlate with the presence of skin disease. The human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes, E6 and E7, are believed to contribute to the development of cervical cancers in women infected with certain HPV genotypes, most notably HPV-16 and HPV-18. Given their expression in tumor tissue, E6 and E7 have been implicated as potential tumor-specific antigens. We have examined an HPV-16 E6- and E7-transgenic mouse lineage for immune responses to these viral oncoproteins. Mice in this lineage express the HPV-16 E6 and E7 genes in their skin and eyes, and on aging, these mice frequently develop squamous cell carcinomas and lenticular tumors. Young transgenic mice, which had measurable E7 protein in the eye but not in the skin, were immunologically naive to E7 protein. They mounted an immune response to E7 on immunization comparable to that of nontransgenic controls, suggesting a lack of immune tolerance to this protein. Older line 19 mice, which are susceptible to skin disease associated with transcription of the E6 and E7 open reading frames, had measurable E7 protein in their skin. These older transgenic mice spontaneously developed antibody responses to endogenous E7 protein, particularly in association with skin disease.

7540105,"Neurodevelopmental outcome after neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. To determine the neurodevelopmental outcome of neonates who underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO group) and similarly critically ill newborns with a lower Oxygenation Index who underwent conventional treatment (comparison group), and to determine whether factors such as the underlying diagnosis and the distance transported from outlying areas affect outcome. Multicentre prospective longitudinal comparative outcome study. An ECMO centre providing services to all of western Canada and four tertiary care neonatal follow-up clinics. All neonates who received treatment between February 1989 and January 1992 at the Western Canadian Regional ECMO Center and who were alive at 2 years of age; 38 (95%) of the 40 surviving ECMO-treated subjects and 26 (87%) of the 30 surviving comparison subjects were available for follow-up. ECMO or conventional therapy for respiratory failure. Neurodevelopmental disability (one or more of cerebral palsy, visual or hearing loss, seizures, severe cognitive disability), and mental and performance developmental indexes of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Six (16%) of the ECMO-treated children had neurodevelopmental disabilities at 2 years of age, as compared with 1 (4%) of the comparison subjects; the difference was not statistically significant. The mean mental developmental index (91.8 [standard deviation (SD) 19.5] v. 100.5 [SD 25.4]) and the mean performance developmental index (87.2 [SD 20.0] v. 96.4 [SD 20.9]) did not differ significantly between the ECMO group and the comparison group respectively. Among the ECMO-treated subjects those whose underlying diagnosis was sepsis had the lowest Bayley indexes, significantly lower than those whose underlying diagnosis was meconium aspiration syndrome. The distance transported did not affect outcome. Neurodevelopmental disability and delay occurred in both groups. The underlying diagnosis appears to affect outcome, whereas distance transported does not. These findings support early transfer for ECMO of critically ill neonates with respiratory failure who do not respond to conventional treatment.

7540097,"Role of platelet activating factor in the inflammatory and secretory effects of Clostridium difficile toxin A. Clostridium difficile is a major recognized cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, an effect mediated through its toxin A. Toxin A has been reported to disrupt epithelial tight junctions, attract neutrophils, and cause striking intestinal inflammation and secretion. Having demonstrated that phospholipase A2 inhibitors block the secretory effects of toxin A, we next wished to examine whether platelet activating factor (PAF) was involved in either the direct epithelial or secretory effects of toxin A. The effects of toxin A on net secretion in ligated rabbit ileal segments were significantly inhibited by the PAF antagonists 10(-4)-10(-5) M BN 52021, 10(-5) M WEB 2170, or 10(-5) M SR 27417 by 59-102%. SR 27417 also inhibited secretion induced by toxin A in loops adjacent to the drug (by 58%). Furthermore, the striking inflammation and epithelial disruption seen at 6 h and ligated ileal segments with toxin A was largely prevented by simultaneous treatment with the PAF antagonist SR 27417. In addition, we noted a significant synergistic effect of 10(-8) M PAF with 10 micrograms/ml toxin A in the ligated rabbit ileal segments. To examine direct effects of PAF antagonists on toxin A in T-84 epithelial cell monolayers, rhodamine-labeled phalloidin stained F-actin demonstrated significant disruption of F-actin by toxin A that was reduced by the PAF antagonist BN 52021 or WEB 2170. However, the PAF antagonists (10(-4) M WEB, 10(-5) M BN or 10(-4) M SR) failed to alter the disruption of T-84 cell tissue resistance by C. difficile toxin A (0.03 micrograms/ml).

We investigated the effect of a synthetic lipid A analogue with low endotoxicity, DT-5461, on the neovascularization induced by B16-BL6 melanoma in syngeneic mice. A systemic single administration of DT-5461 caused a marked decrease in the number of vessels oriented toward the tumor mass and in the tumor size during the early phase of vasculogenesis (on day 4 after tumor inoculation), with little or no inhibition in the following phases. Multiple i.v. administrations of DT-5461 at intervals of 4 days (an effective schedule for inhibiting tumor metastasis) significantly reduced the number of capillary vessels and tumor growth over a period of 14 days after the tumor implantation. Multiple systemic administrations of DT-5461 on days 1, 5 and 9 after tumor inoculation caused a high production of endogenous tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in tumor sites although this treatment modality induced a low production in serum of tumor-bearing mice. Tumor homogenate from mice treated with DT-5461 suppressed the proliferation of endothelium in vitro, whereas sera from animals given DT-5461 had little effect. Furthermore, the antiproliferative effect of the tumor homogenate from mice treated with DT-5461, was completely abrogated by anti-mTNF-alpha monoclonal antibody (mAb). The anti-angiogenic effect of DT-5461 was also completely abrogated by rabbit anti-mouse tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-mTNF-alpha) antiserum, whereas the inhibition of tumor growth by DT-5461 was only slightly diminished. Tumor homogenate from mice treated with DT-5461 suppressed the proliferation of endothelium in vitro, whereas sera from animals given DT-5461 had little effect. Furthermore, the antiproliferative effect of the tumor homogenate from mice treated with DT-5461 was completely neutralized by anti-mTNF-alpha mAb. Multiple i.v. administrations of DT-5461 after s.c. implantation of B16-BL6 cells significantly inhibited the growth of primary tumors measured at the time of tumor excision on day 21, and the lung metastasis of melanoma cells as compared with the untreated control in the spontaneous metastasis model.

We investigated the platelet and plasma levels of serotonin and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, in patients suffering from episodic tension-type headache and migraine with and without aura, during a headache-free period. In female subjects, blood samples were drawn during the follicular, ovulatory, and late luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. In tension headache and migraine with aura, the group mean values of serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in platelets and plasma were significantly increased, but migraine without aura patients' levels were normal. The pattern of menstrual cycle-related fluctuations in platelet serotonin levels were similar in female patients with tension headache and in controls, with a maximum value in the follicular phase. In both migraine groups, in contrast, the peak occurred in the ovulatory phase. The results are discussed in view of whether these aberrations in peripheral markers of the metabolism and menstrual cycle-related rhythmicity of serotonin may reflect similar alterations in the central nervous system.",Gene therapy,metabolism menstrual cycle rhythmicity serotonin primary headache investigated platelet plasma level serotonin metabolite hydroxyindoleacetic acid patient suffering episodic tensiontype headache migraine without aura headachefree period female subject blood sample drawn follicular ovulatory late luteal phase menstrual cycle tension headache migraine aura group mean value serotonin hydroxyindoleacetic acid platelet plasma significantly increased migraine without aura patient level normal pattern menstrual cyclerelated fluctuation platelet serotonin level similar female patient tension headache control maximum value follicular phase migraine group contrast peak occurred ovulatory phase result discussed view whether aberration peripheral marker metabolism menstrual cyclerelated rhythmicity serotonin may reflect similar alteration central nervous system
7539779,"The effect of GM-CSF and G-CSF on human neutrophil function. A direct comparison of GM-CSF and G-CSF in a panel of in vitro neutrophil-function assays was performed to investigate any differences in activity profiles. In our modified chemotactic assay, GM-CSF rapidly increased the migratory capacity of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) to move toward fMLP and LTB4. In contrast, G-CSF only stimulated PMN migration towards fMLP. GM-CSF, but not G-CSF, increased PMN cytotoxic killing of C. albicans blastospores. The expression of PMN surface antigens associated with Fc- and complement-mediated cell-binding (Fc gamma R1, CR-1 and CR-3), and adhesion signalling (ICAM-1), was increased after the exposure of GM-CSF, but not to G-CSF. In contrast these CSFs demonstrated relative equipotency in their ability to induce PMN anti-bacterial phagocytosis, and to restore the Staphylococcus aureus killing capacity of dexamethasone-suppressed neutrophils.

7539775,"Splice variants of CD44 in human cervical cancer stage IB to IIB. Aberrant expression of the cell adhesion molecule CD44 has been detected in human tumors and the expression of specific CD44 isoforms (splice variants) has been shown to be associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in human malignancies. We used three different variant exon sequence-specific murine monoclonal antibodies to epitopes encoded by exon v5, exon v6, or exon v7-v8 of human variant CD44 to study the expression of CD44 splice variants by immunohistochemistry in human cervical cancer. One-hundred five patients with surgically treated squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix stages IB to IIB were included in the study. CD44 splice variants CD44v5, CD44v6, and CD44v7-8 were detected in 70, 67, and 26%, respectively. Tumors expressing exon v6 had significantly more often metastasized to the pelvic nodes (58 vs 79%, P = 0.04). Expression of exon v6 was significantly correlated with a greater probability of vascular space invasion (73 vs 50%, P = 0.04) and a significantly lower rate of inflammatory stromal reaction (48 vs 78%, P = 0.004). Patients suffering from tumors expressing splice variant CD44v6 showed poorer overall survival (P = 0.03). In cases with negative pelvic lymph nodes we found a poorer prognosis when tumors expressed CD44v6 (P = 0.01) or CD44v7-8 (P = 0.02).

7539773,"Progesterone treatment decreases sulfate carbohydrate antigen on endometrial carcinoma cells and inhibits the cell binding to laminin. To investigate the effects of progesterone on endometrial carcinoma, sulfated carbohydrate antigen was studied using a monoclonal antibody, termed E8, that reacts with sulfatide. The reactivity of monoclonal antibody (MAb) E8 with endometrial carcinoma tissues decreased when patients were treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). A reduction of reactivity of MAb E8 with endometrial carcinoma cells was also observed in in vitro examinations using an endometrial carcinoma cell line, Ishikawa cells incubated in MPA-containing medium. Sulfated carbohydrate, such as sulfatide, is the site of binding with laminin. The binding of cell surface components with laminin is thought to be an initial step in the invasion and metastasis of carcinoma cells.

The opening of the cyclosporin A-sensitive permeability transition pore (MTP) in deenergized mitochondria was induced only at millimolar Ca2+. Pretreatment of the mitochondria with 'inducers', such as duroquinone and phenylarsine oxide, allowed observing the pore opening at 0.01-0.1 mM Ca2+. Duroquinone caused a rapid (within 20 s) NAD(P)H oxidation which was followed by a slow (20 min) induction of the pore sensitive to low Ca2+. Phenylarsine oxide capable of cross-linking of vicinal SH-groups caused pore formation without the oxidation of NAD(P)H. The pore opening by both 'inducers' was prevented by N-ethylmaleimide.

Human platelets suspended in plasma or buffer were incubated with low concentrations of the nitric oxide (NO)-donor 3-morpholino-syndnonime (SIN-1; 100 nM to 1 microM) and the stable prostacyclin analogue iloprost (50 or 100 pM) and analyzed for cyclic nucleotide levels and protein phosphorylation. SIN-1 and iloprost synergistically stimulated the phosphorylation of rap1B and the 50 kDa vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein. SIN-1 stimulated platelet cyclic GMP and cAMP-levels and enhanced the increase in cyclic AMP elicited by iloprost. It was found that the mechanism underlying the synergistic phosphorylation of the 50 kDa protein and rap1B was different: synergistic phosphorylation of the 50 kDa protein seemed to be mediated by activation of both protein kinases A and G, whereas the synergistic rap1B phosphorylation could be attributed entirely to activation of protein kinase A.

In this study normoglycemic inbred Wistar-Furth rats were implanted with a syngeneic pancreatico-duodenal graft, i.e. a denervated pancreas. The blood flow to the intact native pancreas and to the transplanted gland was measured with a microsphere technique in anesthetized rats 2 weeks after transplantation. The animals were given an intravenous injection with saline alone, NG-nitro-L-arginine (25 mg/kg body weight) or sodium nitroprusside (10 micrograms/kg body weight) 10 min before blood flow measurements. Administration of NG-nitro-L-arginine increased mean arterial blood pressure and caused a pronounced decrease in whole pancreatic blood flow in both the native and transplanted gland. The islet blood flow was more markedly decreased by NG-nitro-L-arginine in both the native and transplanted pancreas, and constituted about 4% of whole pancreatic blood flow compared with 10% in the control animals. Sodium nitroprusside markedly decreased mean arterial blood pressure, but did not affect pancreatic or islet blood flow in any of the glands. It is concluded that inhibition of nitric oxide synthase causes a preferential decrease in islet blood flow both in the native pancreas and in the transplanted pancreas.

7539765,"Nitric oxide synthase inhibitors block behavioral sensitization to methamphetamine in mice. Repeated administration of methamphetamine (1.0 mg/kg) once daily for 7 consecutive days resulted in an augmentation of the locomotor-activating effect of methamphetamine (0.5 mg/kg) challenged 72 h after the last injection. Administration of the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine (10 and 30 mg/kg), before daily methamphetamine injections dose dependently prevented the development of behavioral sensitization to subsequent methamphetamine challenge. The mice given another NO synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (100 mg/kg), before daily methamphetamine injections showed significantly less locomotor activity in response to 0.5 mg/kg methamphetamine challenge than the mice given daily methamphetamine alone. Such effects were not observed when the inactive isomer, NG-nitro-D-arginine methyl ester (100 mg/kg), was administered daily prior to methamphetamine. Both NO synthase inhibitors exerted the acute effect to reduce spontaneous and methamphetamine-stimulated locomotor activity, while neither spontaneous locomotion nor hyperlocomotion in response to 1.0 mg/kg methamphetamine was altered 72 h after repeated administration of NG-nitro-L-arginine (30 mg/kg) or NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (100 mg/kg) alone once daily for 7 days.

7539757,"The role of bcl-XL in CD40-mediated rescue from anti-mu-induced apoptosis in WEHI-231 B lymphoma cells. The phenotypically immature B cell lymphoma WEHI-231 undergoes apoptotic cell death when cultured with anti-immunoglobulin (Ig) antibodies, via a bcl-2-independent mechanism. We have therefore studied the role of the bcl-2-related protein bcl-x in controlling cell death in WEHI-231. We find that overexpression of the long form of bcl-x (bcl-XL) renders these cells refractory to anti-Ig-induced cell death. Stimulation of WEHI-231 via CD40 has similar protective effects. We show here that ligation of CD40 rapidly induces the appearance of the bcl-XL protein in WEHI-231, while stimulation via sIgM, sIgD, CD5 or CD45 receptors, or with phorbol esters plus ionomycin does not. WEHI-231 cells also rapidly undergo massive apoptosis following culture with thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of the Ca(2+)-ATPase of the endoplasmic reticulum: this is also reversed by anti-CD40, or by overexpression of bcl-XL. We, therefore, conclude that bcl-XL plays a key role in the regulation of antigen receptor-mediated apoptosis via CD40 in WEHI-231. In addition, the fact that this protein is not induced in WEHI-231 in response to phorbol dibutyrate plus ionomycin points to a fundamental signaling defect in these cells, which could conceivably be a reflection of their immature, apoptosis-susceptible phenotype.",Gene therapy,role bclxl cdmediated rescue antimuinduced apoptosis wehi lymphoma cell phenotypically immature cell lymphoma wehi undergoes apoptotic cell death cultured antiimmunoglobulin ig antibody via bclindependent mechanism therefore studied role bclrelated protein bclx controlling cell death wehi find overexpression long form bclx bclxl render cell refractory antiiginduced cell death stimulation wehi via cd similar protective effect show ligation cd rapidly induces appearance bclxl protein wehi stimulation via sigm sigd cd cd receptor phorbol ester plus ionomycin wehi cell also rapidly undergo massive apoptosis following culture thapsigargin specific inhibitor caatpase endoplasmic reticulum also reversed anticd overexpression bclxl therefore conclude bclxl play key role regulation antigen receptormediated apoptosis via cd wehi addition fact protein induced wehi response phorbol dibutyrate plus ionomycin point fundamental signaling defect cell conceivably reflection immature apoptosissusceptible phenotype

7539519,"RC3/neurogranin structure and expression in the caprine brain in relation to congenital hypothyroidism. In view of the profound effects of thyroid hormone deficiency on the central nervous system (CNS), neuronal genes regulated by thyroid hormone could potentially be involved in the development of the CNS. Expression of the neuronal gene RC3/neurogranin was shown to be induced by thyroid hormone in the rat. No data are available on RC3 expression in mammals with prenatal brain development, like humans. To study RC3 mRNA expression in a genetic in vivo model of congenital hypothyroidism, which also resembles the human situation in the timing of brain development relative to birth, we used an inbred strain of congenitally hypothyroid goats. We isolated a cDNA for the caprine RC3 homolog. The deduced amino acid sequence had 99% similarity with the rat and bovine protein sequence. An analysis of the developmental expression of RC3 mRNA levels showed a 3-fold increase between E90 and P0. In situ hybridization analysis showed that in euthyroid goats, the RC3 expression pattern was region-specific and resembled that in rats.

7539517,"Detection of minimal residual disease by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for the PML/RAR alpha fusion mRNA: a study in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia following peripheral stem cell transplantation. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) that is characterized by the presence of a PML/RAR alpha fusion gene resulting from t(15;17). Peripheral stem cell transplantation (PSCT) has been used to treat patients with AML. To assess the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) and the contamination of leukemic cells in peripheral stem cells (PSCs), we examined six patients with APL who were undergoing PSCT, using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis to detect the mRNA of the PML/RAR alpha fusion gene. The fusion gene was expressed in the bone marrow cells during the early phase of a complete remission and in some of the PSCs. Detection of the fusion gene can be useful in monitoring for leukemic cell contamination of PSCs and for predicting a relapse of APL.",Gene therapy,detection minimal residual disease reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction pmlrar alpha fusion mrna study patient acute promyelocytic leukemia following peripheral stem cell transplantation acute promyelocytic leukemia apl subtype acute myelogenous leukemia aml characterized presence pmlrar alpha fusion gene resulting peripheral stem cell transplantation psct used treat patient aml ass presence minimal residual disease mrd contamination leukemic cell peripheral stem cell pscs examined six patient apl undergoing psct using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis detect mrna pmlrar alpha fusion gene fusion gene expressed bone marrow cell early phase complete remission pscs detection fusion gene useful monitoring leukemic cell contamination pscs predicting relapse apl
7539504,"Synthesis of novel products in vitro by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from turnip crinkle virus-infected turnip transcribes both strands of a virus-associated satellite RNA, sat-RNA C (356 bases), in vitro. While both plus- and minus-strand sat-RNA C can direct the synthesis of full-length complementary-strand products, transcription of minus-strand RNA also generates two non-template-sized products, L-RNA and S-RNA (C. Song and A. E. Simon, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:8792-8796, 1994). Here we report that synthesis of L-RNA and S-RNA results from terminal elongation of the 3' end of the template. L-RNA has a panhandle structure and is composed of minus-strand template covalently linked to newly synthesized RNA complementary to its 5' 190 bases. S-RNA is composed of template covalently linked to its full-length complementary strand. All minus-strand templates tested yielded S-RNA. However, synthesis of L-RNA was affected by deletion of the 3' end of the minus-strand template or several internal regions and base alterations near the 5' end or in an internal sequence immediately upstream from the template-product junction that could potentially form a heteroduplex with the 3' end. Furthermore, mutations that disrupted or restored a stem-loop involved in RNA recombination in vivo affected the level of L-RNA produced in vitro, suggesting that the mechanisms for intramolecular formation of panhandle RNAs and intermolecular RNA recombination involve similar features.",Gene therapy,synthesis novel product vitro rnadependent rna polymerase rnadependent rna polymerase turnip crinkle virusinfected turnip transcribes strand virusassociated satellite rna satrna base vitro plus minusstrand satrna direct synthesis fulllength complementarystrand product transcription minusstrand rna also generates two nontemplatesized product lrna srna song simon proc natl acad sci usa report synthesis lrna srna result terminal elongation end template lrna panhandle structure composed minusstrand template covalently linked newly synthesized rna complementary base srna composed template covalently linked fulllength complementary strand minusstrand template tested yielded srna however synthesis lrna affected deletion end minusstrand template several internal region base alteration near end internal sequence immediately upstream templateproduct junction potentially form heteroduplex end furthermore mutation disrupted restored stemloop involved rna recombination vivo affected level lrna produced vitro suggesting mechanism intramolecular formation panhandle rna intermolecular rna recombination involve similar feature
7539478,"Dietary intake of pirfenidone ameliorates bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in hamsters. There are no clinically efficacious drugs available for preventing the development of pulmonary fibrosis (PF). In the present study, we tested the antifibrotic potential of pirfenidone (PD) in the bleomycin (BL) hamster model of PF. Hamsters were intratracheally instilled with isotonic saline solution or BL (7.5 U/kg/5 ml). The animals were fed control diet containing 0.5% PD or the same diet without the drug 2 days before and throughout the study. The four groups were as follows: saline-instilled and fed the control diet (SCD); saline-instilled and fed the same diet containing PD (SPD); BL-instilled and fed the control diet (BCD); and BL-instilled and fed the same diet containing PD (BPD). The animals were killed at 21 days after intratracheal instillation and their lungs processed for various assays. The lung hydroxyproline levels, an index of PF, in SCD, SPD, BCD, and BPD groups were 949, 970, 1759, and 990 micrograms/lung, respectively. The SOD activity and malondialdehyde equivalent levels in the corresponding groups were 443, 524, 612, and 499 units/lung and 56, 49, 108, and 63 nmol/lung, respectively. The lung prolyl hydroxylase activities in the SPD, BCD, and BPD groups were 87%, 147%, and 93% of the control (SCD) group (4.2 x 10(4) dpm/lung/30 minutes), respectively. The lung myeloperoxidase activities were 97%, 236%, and 159% of the control group (0.73 units/lung), respectively.

The effect of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) administration on the functional status of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) in neutropenic AIDS patients was investigated. PMNL destructive activity against Candida albicans or encapsulated or acapsular Cryptococcus neoformans was significantly impaired with respect to control subjects before rhG-CSF treatment. After subcutaneous administration of rhG-CSF (5 micrograms/kg), neutrophil counts increased 3- to 11-fold in 24 h and returned to baseline within 96 h. PMNL fungicidal activity showed significant enhancement 48-72 h after rhG-CSF administration that decreased to baseline within 96 h. Enhanced rhG-CSF-mediated destructive activity strictly correlated with augmented superoxide anion production by PMNL. These findings suggest that therapeutic use of rhG-CSF at appropriate schedules in neutropenic AIDS patients could decrease the risk of infection or, in association with antibiotic therapy, more rapidly resolve the occurring infections.",Gene therapy,beneficial effect recombinant human granulocyte colonystimulating factor fungicidal activity polymorphonuclear leukocyte patient aid effect recombinant human granulocyte colonystimulating factor rhgcsf administration functional status polymorphonuclear leukocyte pmnl neutropenic aid patient investigated pmnl destructive activity candida albicans encapsulated acapsular cryptococcus neoformans significantly impaired respect control subject rhgcsf treatment subcutaneous administration rhgcsf microgramskg neutrophil count increased fold returned baseline within pmnl fungicidal activity showed significant enhancement rhgcsf administration decreased baseline within enhanced rhgcsfmediated destructive activity strictly correlated augmented superoxide anion production pmnl finding suggest therapeutic use rhgcsf appropriate schedule neutropenic aid patient decrease risk infection association antibiotic therapy rapidly resolve occurring infection
7539457,"Adenoviral-mediated gene transfer to fetal pulmonary epithelia in vitro and in vivo. Vector-mediated gene transfer offers a direct method of correcting genetic pulmonary diseases and might also be used to correct temporary abnormalities associated with acquired, nongenetic disorders. Because the fetus or newborn may be a more immune tolerant host for gene transfer using viral vectors, we used replication defective recombinant adenoviral vectors to test the feasibility of gene transfer to the fetal pulmonary epithelium in vitro and in vivo. Both proximal and distal epithelial cells in cultured fetal lung tissues from rodents and humans diffusely expressed the lacZ transgene 3 d after viral infection. In vivo gene delivery experiments were performed in fetal mice and lambs. Delivery of Ad2/CMV-beta Gal to the amniotic fluid in mice produced intense transgene expression in the fetal epidermis and amniotic membranes, some gastrointestinal expression, but no significant airway epithelial expression. When we introduced the adenoviral vector directly into the trachea of fetal lambs, the lacZ gene was expressed in the tracheal, bronchial, and distal pulmonary epithelial cells 3 d after viral infection. Unexpectedly, reactive hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia were noted in epithelia expressing lacZ in the trachea, but not in the distal lung of fetal lambs. 1 wk after infection, adenovirus-treated fetuses developed inflammatory cell infiltrates in the lung tissue with CD4, CD8, IgM, and granulocyte/macrophage positive immune effector cells. Transgene expression faded coincident with inflammation and serologic evidence of antiadenoviral antibody production. While these studies document the feasibility of viral-mediated gene transfer in the prenatal lung, they indicate that immunologic responses to E1-deleted recombinant adenoviruses limit the duration of transgene expression.",Gene therapy,adenoviralmediated gene transfer fetal pulmonary epithelium vitro vivo vectormediated gene transfer offer direct method correcting genetic pulmonary disease might also used correct temporary abnormality associated acquired nongenetic disorder fetus newborn may immune tolerant host gene transfer using viral vector used replication defective recombinant adenoviral vector test feasibility gene transfer fetal pulmonary epithelium vitro vivo proximal distal epithelial cell cultured fetal lung tissue rodent human diffusely expressed lacz transgene viral infection vivo gene delivery experiment performed fetal mouse lamb delivery adcmvbeta gal amniotic fluid mouse produced intense transgene expression fetal epidermis amniotic membrane gastrointestinal expression significant airway epithelial expression introduced adenoviral vector directly trachea fetal lamb lacz gene expressed tracheal bronchial distal pulmonary epithelial cell viral infection unexpectedly reactive hyperplasia squamous metaplasia noted epithelium expressing lacz trachea distal lung fetal lamb wk infection adenovirustreated fetus developed inflammatory cell infiltrates lung tissue cd cd igm granulocytemacrophage positive immune effector cell transgene expression faded coincident inflammation serologic evidence antiadenoviral antibody production study document feasibility viralmediated gene transfer prenatal lung indicate immunologic response edeleted recombinant adenovirus limit duration transgene expression
7539456,"Blockade of very late antigen-4 integrin binding to fibronectin with connecting segment-1 peptide reduces accelerated coronary arteriopathy in rabbit cardiac allografts. Graft arteriopathy, a leading cause of cardiac allograft failure, is associated with increased intimal smooth muscle cells, inflammatory cells, and accumulation of extracellular matrix. We hypothesized that cellular fibronectin plays a pivotal role in the progression of the allograft arteriopathy by directing the transendothelial trafficking of inflammatory cells through interaction of the connecting segment-1 (CS1) motif with the very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) integrin, and tested this in vivo using a blocking peptide. Cholesterol-fed rabbits underwent heterotopic cardiac transplantation without immunosuppression. The treatment group (n = 7) received a synthetic CS1 peptide (1 mg/kg per d, subcutaneously), and the controls (n = 7) received an inactive peptide (1 mg/kg per d, subcutaneously). At 7-8 d after transplantation, hearts were harvested and sectioned for morphometric analysis and immunohistochemical studies. We observed a > 50% decrease in the incidence (P < 0.001) and severity (P < 0.001) of donor coronary artery intimal thickening in the CS1-treated compared with the control group. These findings correlated with reduced infiltration of T cells (P < 0.05), a trend toward decreased expression of adhesion molecules (P < 0.06), and less accumulation of fibronectin (P < 0.03). Our data suggest that the VLA-4-fibronectin interaction is critical to the progression of the allograft arteriopathy by perpetuating the immune-inflammatory response in the vessel wall.",Gene therapy,blockade late antigen integrin binding fibronectin connecting segment peptide reduces accelerated coronary arteriopathy rabbit cardiac allograft graft arteriopathy leading cause cardiac allograft failure associated increased intimal smooth muscle cell inflammatory cell accumulation extracellular matrix hypothesized cellular fibronectin play pivotal role progression allograft arteriopathy directing transendothelial trafficking inflammatory cell interaction connecting segment c motif late antigen vla integrin tested vivo using blocking peptide cholesterolfed rabbit underwent heterotopic cardiac transplantation without immunosuppression treatment group received synthetic c peptide mgkg per subcutaneously control received inactive peptide mgkg per subcutaneously transplantation heart harvested sectioned morphometric analysis immunohistochemical study observed decrease incidence severity donor coronary artery intimal thickening cstreated compared control group finding correlated reduced infiltration cell trend toward decreased expression adhesion molecule le accumulation fibronectin data suggest vlafibronectin interaction critical progression allograft arteriopathy perpetuating immuneinflammatory response vessel wall
7539408,"Molecular analysis of neutralizing epitopes on outer surface proteins A and B of Borrelia burgdorferi. The neutralizing epitopes of the major outer surface proteins A and B (OspA and OspB) of Borrelia burgdorferi B31 were investigated by epitope mapping using overlapping synthetic peptides, encompassing full-length OspA and OspB, and antiborrelial monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). OspA MAb N4B12 and OspB MAbs N5G5, W7C2, and P4D1 displayed a complement-independent antiborrelial activity, and complement failed to enhance the antiborrelial activity, as measured by a sensitive colorimetric assay. A combination of N4B12 with N5G5 displayed a higher antiborrelial activity than did the MAbs individually. OspA MAbs B3G11 and L3B5, however, exhibited a significant antiborrelial activity only in the presence of complement. Epitope mapping showed that B3G11 bound to one OspA synthetic peptide with the sequence of amino acids 247 to 256 (QYDSNGTKLE) and produced more than sixfold-higher reactivity than with other sequences, as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. OspB MAb N5G5 bound to an OspB peptide with the sequence of amino acids 211 to 220 (TLKREIEKDG), yielding at least threefold-higher reactivity than with other sequences. These two peptide sequences were found to contain neutralizing epitopes. Other MAbs had weak binding activities with the synthetic peptides, and their specific epitopes remain to be further analyzed.

7539392,"The unc-8 and sup-40 genes regulate ion channel function in Caenorhabditis elegans motorneurons. Two Caenorhabditis elegans genes, unc-8 and sup-40, have been newly identified, by genetic criteria, as regulating ion channel function in motorneurons. Two dominant unc-8 alleles cause motorneuron swelling similar to that of other neuronal types in dominant mutants of the deg-1 gene family, which is homologous to a mammalian gene family encoding amiloride-sensitive sodium channel subunits. As for previously identified deg-1 family members, unc-8 dominant mutations are recessively suppressed by mutations in the mec-6 gene, which probably encodes a second type of channel component. An unusual dominant mutation, sup-41 (lb125), also co-suppresses unc-8 and deg-1, suggesting the existence of yet another common component of ion channels containing unc-8 or deg-1 subunits. Dominant, transacting, intragenic suppressor mutations have been isolated for both unc-8 and deg-1, consistent with the idea that, like their mammalian homologues, the two gene products function as multimers.

7539388,"Effect of cerulein hyperstimulation on the paracellular barrier of rat exocrine pancreas. Cerulein-induced pancreatitis causes a rapid increase in pancreatic enzyme levels in serum and decreases in pancreatic duct secretion and interstitial edema. One mechanism to explain these early events is disruption of the actin tight junction paracellular seal of acinar and intralobular pancreatic duct cells. To examine the paracellular barrier of the proximal exocrine pancreas, rats were hyperstimulated with 5.0 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 of cerulein. Actin was visualized with rhodamine phalloidin and by electron microscopy and tight junctions were visualized with antibodies to the tight-junction protein ZO-1. Paracellular permeability was measured by movement of horseradish peroxidase from interstitium into duct or acinar lumens. In controls, linear actin and ZO-1 staining occurred along the apical membrane of intralobular duct cells and extended to the apical pole of acinar cells. Hyperstimulation caused progressive disruption of the linear staining of f-actin and ZO-1. Actin disruption in duct cells was confirmed by electron microscopy. Horseradish peroxidase entered intralobular ducts and acinar lumens of hyperstimulated animals more frequently than those of controls. The structure and function of the paracellular barrier of acinar and intralobular pancreatic duct cells are disrupted early during cerulein pancreatitis and may contribute to early clinical features.",Gene therapy,effect cerulein hyperstimulation paracellular barrier rat exocrine pancreas ceruleininduced pancreatitis cause rapid increase pancreatic enzyme level serum decrease pancreatic duct secretion interstitial edema one mechanism explain early event disruption actin tight junction paracellular seal acinar intralobular pancreatic duct cell examine paracellular barrier proximal exocrine pancreas rat hyperstimulated microgramskgh cerulein actin visualized rhodamine phalloidin electron microscopy tight junction visualized antibody tightjunction protein zo paracellular permeability measured movement horseradish peroxidase interstitium duct acinar lumen control linear actin zo staining occurred along apical membrane intralobular duct cell extended apical pole acinar cell hyperstimulation caused progressive disruption linear staining factin zo actin disruption duct cell confirmed electron microscopy horseradish peroxidase entered intralobular duct acinar lumen hyperstimulated animal frequently control structure function paracellular barrier acinar intralobular pancreatic duct cell disrupted early cerulein pancreatitis may contribute early clinical feature
7539387,"Nitric oxide modulates pancreatic basal secretion and response to cerulein in the rat: effects in acute pancreatitis. Nitric oxide synthase activity is detected in the pancreas, but the role of NO on pancreatic function has not been fully characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of NO in normal and diseased pancreatic function. Amylase and NO secretion were measured in vivo in rats and in vitro in dispersed acini, with and without NO synthesis blockade, by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Rats were subjected to cerulein-induced pancreatitis, and the effects of L-NAME or NO donors were assessed. L-NAME reduced amylase output to 60% of basal. This effect was reversed by L-arginine. The secretory response to optimal doses of cerulein induced a poor amylase secretion and a marked release of NO. High doses of cerulein in combination with L-NAME inhibited NO formation and amylase secretion. In dispersed acini, supramaximal cerulein concentrations induced NO release, but the amylase dose-response curve was not modified by NO inhibition. In acute pancreatitis, L-NAME increased amylasemia and tissue myeloperoxidase activities, whereas NO donors reduced amylasemia, lipasemia, and the histological damage score. The L-arginine/NO pathway facilitates basal and stimulated pancreatic secretion in vivo. NO donor drugs may improve the course of acute pancreatitis.",Gene therapy,nitric oxide modulates pancreatic basal secretion response cerulein rat effect acute pancreatitis nitric oxide synthase activity detected pancreas role pancreatic function fully characterized aim study evaluate role normal diseased pancreatic function amylase secretion measured vivo rat vitro dispersed acinus without synthesis blockade ngnitrolarginine methyl ester lname rat subjected ceruleininduced pancreatitis effect lname donor assessed lname reduced amylase output basal effect reversed larginine secretory response optimal dos cerulein induced poor amylase secretion marked release high dos cerulein combination lname inhibited formation amylase secretion dispersed acinus supramaximal cerulein concentration induced release amylase doseresponse curve modified inhibition acute pancreatitis lname increased amylasemia tissue myeloperoxidase activity whereas donor reduced amylasemia lipasemia histological damage score larginineno pathway facilitates basal stimulated pancreatic secretion vivo donor drug may improve course acute pancreatitis

Although a short treatment with any of the molecules decreased the growth of colony-forming unit granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) and burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) progenitors (except for TNF-alpha as it is a greater inhibitor for CFU-GM), further experiments using a 6-day liquid culture in the presence of a combination of growth factors (recombinant human interleukin-3 [rhIL-3], IL-6, IL-1 beta, GM colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], G-CSF, erythropoeitin [Epo], and stem cell factor [SCF]) allowed us to determine a number of differences between their effects: 1) TGF-beta and TNF-alpha induced a stronger decrease in the proliferation and clonogenicity of CD34+ subsets than MIP-1 alpha and AcSDKP, 2) the dose-response curves appeared different, and 3) contrary to TGF-beta and TNF-alpha, AcSDKP and MIP-1 alpha required repeated addition to induce inhibition.

7539363,"Use of a Gammarus pulex bioassay to measure the effects of transient carbofuran runoff from farmland. There is now much information on the presence of pesticides in surface waters, but very little about their actual effects on aquatic life. This paper reports on the transient concentrations of a carbamate insecticide carbofuran, which were observed in a head-water stream draining treated farmland, and describes the resulting effects on a bioassay organism. One month after an application of 3 kg carbofuran/ha as broadcast granules to an oilseed rape crop, carbofuran concentrations of up to 26 micrograms/liter were measured in a nearby headwater stream after heavy rainfall. The majority of the carbofuran was translocated via field drains (where concentrations up to 264 micrograms/liter were detected), although the possibility of some surface runoff cannot be ruled out. Peak carbofuran concentrations only persisted for about 24 hr after the rainfall event, although measurable levels could be detected for at least 4 days. An in situ bioassay of streamwater which monitored the feeding rate of the gammarid amphipod crustacean Gammarus pulex showed that feeding stopped completely during the rainfall event, and was rapidly followed by death of all the caged organisms. Subsequent laboratory studies of toxicity showed that the peak concentrations of carbofuran had exceeded the G. pulex 24-hr LC50 of 21 micrograms/liter, and that concentrations as low as 4 micrograms/liter could reduce feeding rate.

7538995,"Inhibition of neutral endopeptidase increases airway responsiveness to ACh in nonsensitized normal rats. The effects of sensory neuropeptides on the airway responsiveness to acetylcholine (ACh) were investigated in normal nonsensitized rats. The airway responsiveness to inhaled ACh was significantly increased after treatment with neurokinin A (NKA; 0.001%) or substance P (SP; 0.01%) aerosol in the presence of the neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor. NKA had a more potent effect than SP. Interestingly, the intravenous treatment with NEP inhibitor alone also induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to inhaled ACh. This AHR was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with a nonselective NK-receptor antagonist, [D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9]SP, systemic capsaicin, or bilateral cervical vagotomy, indicating that decreased NEP activity results in accumulation of endogenous sensory neuropeptide(s) and enhancement of vagal reflex to cause AHR. The airway responsiveness to ACh of isolated left main bronchus was also increased after treatment with 10(-6) M NKA, but not SP, together with 10(-6) M phosphoramidon. This in vitro AHR to ACh induced by phosphoramidon plus NKA was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with 10(-6) M tetrodotoxin. These findings suggest that overaccumulated sensory neuropeptides, especially NKA, may enhance the probability of transmitter release, probably via NK2 receptors, and that the enhanced transmitter release might be involved in AHR in rats.",Gene therapy,inhibition neutral endopeptidase increase airway responsiveness ach nonsensitized normal rat effect sensory neuropeptides airway responsiveness acetylcholine ach investigated normal nonsensitized rat airway responsiveness inhaled ach significantly increased treatment neurokinin nka substance sp aerosol presence neutral endopeptidase nep inhibitor nka potent effect sp interestingly intravenous treatment nep inhibitor alone also induced airway hyperresponsiveness ahr inhaled ach ahr significantly attenuated pretreatment nonselective nkreceptor antagonist dprodtrpsp systemic capsaicin bilateral cervical vagotomy indicating decreased nep activity result accumulation endogenous sensory neuropeptides enhancement vagal reflex cause ahr airway responsiveness ach isolated left main bronchus also increased treatment nka sp together phosphoramidon vitro ahr ach induced phosphoramidon plus nka significantly attenuated pretreatment tetrodotoxin finding suggest overaccumulated sensory neuropeptides especially nka may enhance probability transmitter release probably via nk receptor enhanced transmitter release might involved ahr rat

A cDNA, coding for the first Drosophila melanogaster homolog of a family of proteins (FK506-binding proteins, FKBPs) which bind to the immunosuppressive drug FK506, was isolated. The deduced aa sequence corresponds to a 39-kDa product (FKBP39) which, besides a domain with similarity to FKBPs, has a highly charged domain with two strongly acidic stretches. The transcript could be detected in all developmental stages, with the highest expression in the embryo. In adult flies, the strongest signal was detected in the ovaries.

A membrane-bound 45.5 kDa protein has been isolated from Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae. It shows an absorption spectrum, which closely resembles the action spectrum for amoebal phototaxis, leading to the conclusion that this protein might play an important role in the photoreception of Dictyostelium amoebae. For further characterization we employed phase partition in an aqueous polymer two-phase system, which was developed by Widell and Larsson for the separation of plasma membrane proteins of higher plants. This method clearly shows that the 45.5 kDa protein is a plasma membrane protein and not an intracellular protein. Furthermore, by using phase systems with increasing polymer concentrations, this simple and rapid purification of plasma membrane proteins allowed us to isolate the putative photoreceptor in one single step. Compared to standard biochemical methods phase partition provides an enormous facilitation of the isolation of D. discoideum membrane proteins.",Gene therapy,rapid simple method isolation characterization photoreceptor dictyostelium discoideum amoeba membranebound kda protein isolated dictyostelium discoideum amoeba show absorption spectrum closely resembles action spectrum amoebal phototaxis leading conclusion protein might play important role photoreception dictyostelium amoeba characterization employed phase partition aqueous polymer twophase system developed widell larsson separation plasma membrane protein higher plant method clearly show kda protein plasma membrane protein intracellular protein furthermore using phase system increasing polymer concentration simple rapid purification plasma membrane protein allowed u isolate putative photoreceptor one single step compared standard biochemical method phase partition provides enormous facilitation isolation discoideum membrane protein

7537100,"Effect of a chemical or proteolytic modification on the biological activity of guinea-pig cationic peptide. Guinea-pig neutrophil cationic peptides (GNCPs) are single polypeptides containing 31 amino acid residues and three intramolecular disulfide bonds, which show both antibacterial and histamine-releasing activities. Reduction and alkylation of the disulfide bonds of GNCP did not reduce both biological activities. When pyridylethylated GNCP was digested with trypsin, the biological activities were almost lost, whereas the chymotryptic digest retained the biological activities. Chymotrypsin digested fragments were purified by RP-HPLC, and three active peptide fragments containing two Arg residues at the N-terminal sequence were isolated. When the biological activities were examined using synthetic peptides containing various numbers of Arg residue at the N-terminus, the omission of the Arg residues was found to reduce remarkably the antibacterial and histamine-releasing activities. Together these observations indicate that the primary structures containing Arg residues at the N-terminus but not the intramolecular disulfide cross-linking are important for the expression of the biological activities of GNCP.",Gene therapy,effect chemical proteolytic modification biological activity guineapig cationic peptide guineapig neutrophil cationic peptide gncps single polypeptide containing amino acid residue three intramolecular disulfide bond show antibacterial histaminereleasing activity reduction alkylation disulfide bond gncp reduce biological activity pyridylethylated gncp digested trypsin biological activity almost lost whereas chymotryptic digest retained biological activity chymotrypsin digested fragment purified rphplc three active peptide fragment containing two arg residue nterminal sequence isolated biological activity examined using synthetic peptide containing various number arg residue nterminus omission arg residue found reduce remarkably antibacterial histaminereleasing activity together observation indicate primary structure containing arg residue nterminus intramolecular disulfide crosslinking important expression biological activity gncp

We compared the severity of cardiac allograft vascular disease in rats treated with cyclosporine or FK506 and studied the effect of antithrombotic agents on cardiac allograft vascular disease. One group each was treated with 2 and 5 mg/kg/day of cyclosporine. Two other groups were injected with heparin and dipyridamole, respectively, in addition to cyclosporine. Four other groups were similarly divided by dose of FK506 (0.1 or 0.25 mg/kg/day) and concomitant anticoagulant treatment. Grade of rejection and percentage stenosis of coronary arteries were lower in groups with high doses of immunosuppressive agents or with heparin. Major histocompatibility class II antigens were expressed by the endothelium of grafted hearts, and IgM and C3 were deposited in the intimal and medial layers in all groups except those administered the higher doses of immunosuppressive drugs. However, no remarkable differences in density of major histocompatibility class II antigens were found between groups demonstrating expression of these antigens. On the other hand, the intensity of IgM or C3 expression grew significantly as coronary stenosis increased in severity. A significant difference in severity of cardiac allograft vascular disease was not found between the groups treated with cyclosporine and FK506, and cardiac allograft vascular disease was almost entirely suppressed when doses of cyclosporine and FK506 sufficient to suppress graft rejection were administered.

The emergence of new cytotoxic agents and techniques for treatment of systemic disease as single modalities or in combination with irradiation and surgery will impact on the use of such agents in the management of systemic breast cancer. Metastatic breast carcinoma, unlike other solid tumors, is highly responsive to chemotherapy, response rates of 50 to 70% have been reported consistently, although there has not been a significant improvement on long-term survival of these patients in the last ten years. New therapeutic approaches include cytotoxic and hormonal agents, growth and differentiation factors, monoclonal antibodies, hematopoietic stem cell support, conquest of tumor cell resistance by MDR-modulation, genetic manipulation, identification of new targets on the tumor surface, synthesis of target-oriented designer-drugs and inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. In breast cancer the tumor growth correlates with vascularization and angiogenesis. Tumor angiogenesis is stimulated by the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Microvessel density is a significant predictor of survival among node-negative women, who are at risk for having occult metastases at presentation. These patients could then be given systemic adjuvant therapy. Animal experiments show promising inhibition of tumor growth in nude mice after application of antibodies against VEGF. Other methods of manipulation of molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis are under investigation.",Gene therapy,alternative form therapy breast carcinoma status perspective treatment metastasized breast carcinoma emergence new cytotoxic agent technique treatment systemic disease single modality combination irradiation surgery impact use agent management systemic breast cancer metastatic breast carcinoma unlike solid tumor highly responsive chemotherapy response rate reported consistently although significant improvement longterm survival patient last ten year new therapeutic approach include cytotoxic hormonal agent growth differentiation factor monoclonal antibody hematopoietic stem cell support conquest tumor cell resistance mdrmodulation genetic manipulation identification new target tumor surface synthesis targetoriented designerdrugs inhibition tumor angiogenesis breast cancer tumor growth correlate vascularization angiogenesis tumor angiogenesis stimulated vascular endothelial growth factor vegf microvessel density significant predictor survival among nodenegative woman risk occult metastasis presentation patient given systemic adjuvant therapy animal experiment show promising inhibition tumor growth nude mouse application antibody vegf method manipulation molecular mechanism angiogenesis investigation

7533857,"Immunogenic targeting of recombinant peptide vaccines to human antigen-presenting cells by chimeric anti-HLA-DR and anti-surface immunoglobulin D antibody Fab fragments in vitro. To increase the inherently weak immunogenicity of synthetic peptide vaccines, we used recombinant DNA techniques to generate chimeras between immunogenic determinants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 and antibody Fab fragments reactive with surface structures displayed specifically on human antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including surface immunoglobulin D (sIgD) and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Hybridomas producing anti-human MHC class II (HLA-DR) or surface immunoglobulin D monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that recognize nonpolymorphic determinants were used to clone chimeric Fab gene fragments by employing an established procedure to generate antigen-binding Fab libraries in phagemid vector pComb3. Molecular and immunochemical analysis indicated that the expected chimeric Fab fragments expressing the HIV-1 epitopes were correctly cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and retained the binding specificity of the native (hybridoma-derived) MAb. The chimeric Fab fragments targeted the linked HIV-1-derived antigenic determinants to the surface of human APCs in vitro, as evidenced by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Furthermore, such recombinant immunotargeted HIV-1 peptide antigens demonstrated improved immunogenicity over equivalent nonimmunotargeted control antigens, as shown by their ability to stimulate interleukin-2 production by CD4+ T-helper cells from human donors exposed to HIV-1 antigens. These data suggest that immunotargeting of recombinant peptide antigens via the attached Fab fragments facilitates uptake by human APCs with subsequent access to the MHC class II processing pathway, thereby validating the immunotargeting concept for such recombinant subunit vaccines in an in vitro human system.",Gene therapy,immunogenic targeting recombinant peptide vaccine human antigenpresenting cell chimeric antihladr antisurface immunoglobulin antibody fab fragment vitro increase inherently weak immunogenicity synthetic peptide vaccine used recombinant dna technique generate chimera immunogenic determinant human immunodeficiency virus type hiv gp antibody fab fragment reactive surface structure displayed specifically human antigenpresenting cell apc including surface immunoglobulin sigd class ii major histocompatibility complex mhc molecule hybridoma producing antihuman mhc class ii hladr surface immunoglobulin monoclonal antibody mabs recognize nonpolymorphic determinant used clone chimeric fab gene fragment employing established procedure generate antigenbinding fab library phagemid vector pcomb molecular immunochemical analysis indicated expected chimeric fab fragment expressing hiv epitope correctly cloned expressed escherichia coli retained binding specificity native hybridomaderived mab chimeric fab fragment targeted linked hivderived antigenic determinant surface human apc vitro evidenced fluorescenceactivated cell sorter analysis furthermore recombinant immunotargeted hiv peptide antigen demonstrated improved immunogenicity equivalent nonimmunotargeted control antigen shown ability stimulate interleukin production cd thelper cell human donor exposed hiv antigen data suggest immunotargeting recombinant peptide antigen via attached fab fragment facilitates uptake human apc subsequent access mhc class ii processing pathway thereby validating immunotargeting concept recombinant subunit vaccine vitro human system
7533711,"Mechanism-based comparisons of acute toxicities elicited by industrial organic chemicals in procaryotic and eucaryotic systems. Comparisons of toxicities elicited by nonpolar and polar narcotics, weak acid uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation, and bioreactive chemicals between the eucaryotic systems Pimephales promelas and Tetrahymena pyriformis and the procaryotic systems Escherichia coli and Photobacterium phosphoreum were performed. Each chemical had been a priori assigned a mechanism/mode of action based on the results from previous studies with eucaryotic systems. Hydrophobicity-dependent QSARs for nonpolar narcosis for both the E. coli and the P. phosphoreum endpoints was developed. However, due to the lack of a significant relationship between P. phosphoreum toxicity and log Kow, such a QSAR for polar narcosis was developed only for the E. coli endpoint. Except for 4-nitroaniline (the only chemical in the examined group that required activation to become the Michael receptor), all chemicals containing reactive substructures revealed excess toxicity over polar narcosis QSAR for E. coli endpoints. Moreover, chloroacidic acid and ethyl chloroacetate in this system also appear to be bioreactive. The only mechanism that seemed to not exist in the procaryotic system was uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Chemicals from this group, except 2,4-dinitroaniline, did not exhibit excess toxicity over polar narcosis QSAR. This was thought to be explained by the lack of mitochondria in procaryotes, the target site of uncoupling agents in eucaryotes. In addition, evaluation of toxicities of halogen-substituted short-chain carboxylic alcohols indicated that their mechanisms vary, depending upon the type of substitution and the system.",Gene therapy,mechanismbased comparison acute toxicity elicited industrial organic chemical procaryotic eucaryotic system comparison toxicity elicited nonpolar polar narcotic weak acid uncouplers oxidative phosphorylation bioreactive chemical eucaryotic system pimephales promelas tetrahymena pyriformis procaryotic system escherichia coli photobacterium phosphoreum performed chemical priori assigned mechanismmode action based result previous study eucaryotic system hydrophobicitydependent qsars nonpolar narcosis coli phosphoreum endpoint developed however due lack significant relationship phosphoreum toxicity log kow qsar polar narcosis developed coli endpoint except nitroaniline chemical examined group required activation become michael receptor chemical containing reactive substructure revealed excess toxicity polar narcosis qsar coli endpoint moreover chloroacidic acid ethyl chloroacetate system also appear bioreactive mechanism seemed exist procaryotic system uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation chemical group except dinitroaniline exhibit excess toxicity polar narcosis qsar thought explained lack mitochondrion procaryote target site uncoupling agent eucaryote addition evaluation toxicity halogensubstituted shortchain carboxylic alcohol indicated mechanism vary depending upon type substitution system

7532683,"Murine CD14 gene expression in vivo: extramyeloid synthesis and regulation by lipopolysaccharide. A murine model system was used to study the distribution and regulation of CD14 gene expression in vivo. Western blot analysis failed to detect CD14 in plasma from untreated CB6 (BALB/c x C57Bl6) mice, but showed markedly increased levels of CD14 in plasma from mice treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Plasma levels of CD14 increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner, reaching a maximum between 8 and 16 h. Northern blot analysis of total RNA extracted from mouse tissues revealed low, but significant, levels of CD14 mRNA in many tissues of untreated animals with the highest levels in uterus, adipose tissue, and lung. After intraperitoneal injection of LPS, induction of CD14 gene expression was detected in all organs examined with the extent of induction varying between organs. Induction of CD14 mRNA was both time and dose dependent. Maximum induction in the heart and lung was observed 2-4 h after injection of LPS, while liver and kidney showed maximal induction between 8 and 16 h. In situ hybridization showed that CD14 mRNA was expressed in myeloid cells in many tissues, and that expression in these cells was upregulated by LPS. Unexpectedly, CD14 mRNA was also detected in other cells within tissues, including epithelial cells, and expression in these cell types also was upregulated by LPS. Immunochemical analysis revealed that CD14 antigen colocalized to the cytoplasm of cells expressing CD14 mRNA. These studies demonstrate that CD14 gene expression is not restricted to myeloid cells, and that the level of expression of CD14 is influenced by exposure to LPS.",Gene therapy,murine cd gene expression vivo extramyeloid synthesis regulation lipopolysaccharide murine model system used study distribution regulation cd gene expression vivo western blot analysis failed detect cd plasma untreated cb balbc cbl mouse showed markedly increased level cd plasma mouse treated lipopolysaccharide lp plasma level cd increased time dosedependent manner reaching maximum northern blot analysis total rna extracted mouse tissue revealed low significant level cd mrna many tissue untreated animal highest level uterus adipose tissue lung intraperitoneal injection lp induction cd gene expression detected organ examined extent induction varying organ induction cd mrna time dose dependent maximum induction heart lung observed injection lp liver kidney showed maximal induction situ hybridization showed cd mrna expressed myeloid cell many tissue expression cell upregulated lp unexpectedly cd mrna also detected cell within tissue including epithelial cell expression cell type also upregulated lp immunochemical analysis revealed cd antigen colocalized cytoplasm cell expressing cd mrna study demonstrate cd gene expression restricted myeloid cell level expression cd influenced exposure lp

This report examines the adhesive interactions of human CD4+ T lymphocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha-activated human endothelial cell monolayers in an in vitro model that mimics microcirculatory flow conditions. Resting CD4+ T cell interactions with activated endothelium consisted of initial attachment followed by rolling, stable arrest, and then spreading and transendothelial migration. P-selectin, but not E-, or L-selectin, mediated most of this initial contact and rolling, whereas beta 1-integrins (alpha 4 beta 1), interacting with endothelial-expressed vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, participated in rolling and mediated stable arrest.

Moreover, IORT, alone or in combination, relieved pain. Adjuvant IORT for residual tumors (n = 20) might not effectively prolong survival, because the difference in survival rate between noncurative resection plus IORT and nonresection plus IORT in combination with EBRT was not significant.

The presence of cancer of the prostate does not mean that a patient will succumb to the disease. In fact, prior to the advent of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, the cause of death in 50% of men with detectable extraglandular cancer was intercurrent disease. No studies have conclusively demonstrated a definitive benefit of surgery or radiation over simple observation; therefore treatment complications must absolutely be restricted to a bare minimum while demonstrating curative effect.

7532665,"Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate inhibits intercellular adhesion molecule-1 biosynthesis induced by cytokines in human fibroblasts. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), the ligand of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1, plays an important role in the interactions of a variety of hemopoietic and nonhemopoietic cells, including leukocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. ICAM-1 is known to be involved in the onset of several diseases such as inflammation, allograft rejection, and so on. In this report, we investigated the effects of dexamethasone, cyclosporin A, FK506, and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) on the induction of the ICAM-1 gene by cytokines in fibroblasts. PDTC, a potent inhibitor of NF-kappa B, was shown by ELISA and FACS analysis to prevent dramatically the expression of the ICAM-1 gene stimulated by IL-1 alpha, IFN-gamma, and PMA, although the other reagents inhibited it only slightly. Ribonuclease protection assay revealed that PDTC blocked the expression of the ICAM-1 gene at the mRNA level. To elucidate the mechanism of this inhibition, we constructed a series of ICAM-1 promoter deletion mutants linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene and analyzed the effect of PDTC on their activities. Transient transfection analysis indicated that the critical region for inhibition by PDTC is an NF-kappa B binding site-like motif (GGGAGGATTCC, ICAM-1 kappa B) that is located at position-540. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay revealed that PDTC actually inhibits the binding of NF-kappa B (or NF-kappa B-like) protein to the ICAM-1 kappa B site. These findings suggest that PDTC inhibits ICAM-1 gene expression by inhibiting the association of NF-kappa B (or NF-kappa B-like) protein with the ICAM-1 kappa B site.",Gene therapy,pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate inhibits intercellular adhesion molecule biosynthesis induced cytokine human fibroblast intercellular adhesion molecule icam ligand lymphocyte functionassociated antigen play important role interaction variety hemopoietic nonhemopoietic cell including leukocyte fibroblast endothelial cell icam known involved onset several disease inflammation allograft rejection report investigated effect dexamethasone cyclosporin fk pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate pdtc induction icam gene cytokine fibroblast pdtc potent inhibitor nfkappa shown elisa facs analysis prevent dramatically expression icam gene stimulated il alpha ifngamma pma although reagent inhibited slightly ribonuclease protection assay revealed pdtc blocked expression icam gene mrna level elucidate mechanism inhibition constructed series icam promoter deletion mutant linked chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene analyzed effect pdtc activity transient transfection analysis indicated critical region inhibition pdtc nfkappa binding sitelike motif gggaggattcc icam kappa located position electrophoresis mobility shift assay revealed pdtc actually inhibits binding nfkappa nfkappa blike protein icam kappa site finding suggest pdtc inhibits icam gene expression inhibiting association nfkappa nfkappa blike protein icam kappa site
7543914,"Fluorescent conjugates of brefeldin A selectively stain the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex of living cells. The fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA) interferes with vesicular trafficking in most animal cells. To gain insight into the mechanism of BFA action, we esterified it to the fluorophore, boron dipyromethene difluoride (BODIPY). BODIPY-BEA localized predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex of viable cells and was extracted by detergent treatment, suggesting it interacts primarily with lipid bilayers. The localization of the conjugate is conferred by BFA, since free BODIPY or BODIPY esterified to cyclopentanol did not specifically localize to internal membranes. BODIPY-BFA exhibited a similar biological activity to BFA, but only when used at higher concentrations and after a delay. HPLC analysis revealed that over this period, cells converted BODIPY-BFA to species co-eluting with free BODIPY and BFA. Therefore, BODIPY-BFA is probably inactive until BFA is released by cellular esterases. The specific localization of BODIPY-BFA to the ER and Golgi complex suggests that BFA might exert its effects on vesicular trafficking by perturbing the lipid bilayer of its target organelles. Because BODIPY-BFA intensely stains the ER at concentrations that have no discernible effects on intracellular transport or other cellular functions, it should be useful for visualizing the ER in living cells.",Immunology,fluorescent conjugate brefeldin selectively stain endoplasmic reticulum golgi complex living cell fungal metabolite brefeldin bfa interferes vesicular trafficking animal cell gain insight mechanism bfa action esterified fluorophore boron dipyromethene difluoride bodipy bodipybea localized predominantly endoplasmic reticulum er golgi complex viable cell extracted detergent treatment suggesting interacts primarily lipid bilayers localization conjugate conferred bfa since free bodipy bodipy esterified cyclopentanol specifically localize internal membrane bodipybfa exhibited similar biological activity bfa used higher concentration delay hplc analysis revealed period cell converted bodipybfa specie coeluting free bodipy bfa therefore bodipybfa probably inactive bfa released cellular esterases specific localization bodipybfa er golgi complex suggests bfa might exert effect vesicular trafficking perturbing lipid bilayer target organelle bodipybfa intensely stain er concentration discernible effect intracellular transport cellular function useful visualizing er living cell
7543377,"Relationship between hprt mutant frequency, aromatic DNA adducts and genotypes for GSTM1 and NAT2 in bus maintenance workers. We have studied the mutant frequency in the human gene for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) using the T-cell cloning assay, the aromatic DNA adduct level using the 32P-postlabelling assay, and related the levels of these biomarkers to the genotypes for glutathione transferase (GST mu) and N-acetyltransferase (NAT2) in non-smoking bus maintenance workers exposed to diesel exhaust. No difference in mutant frequency was observed between the 47 exposed (8.6 x 10(-6), age range 27-65) and the 22 control individuals (8.4 x 10(-6), age range 23-61), while the difference in adduct level (3.2 versus 2.3 x 10(-8)) was highly significant (P = 0.0009). Both mutant frequency and adduct level were highest in the 16 most heavily exposed workers. Overall, a significant increase of mutant frequency was observed with adduct level (P = 0.008) as well as with age (P < 0.0001). The age dependence was higher in the GSTM1-negative slow acetylators (3.1%/year) as compared to the three other genotype combinations (2.4-2.5%/year). There was no significant difference in mutant frequency or in adduct level between the GSTM1-negative (49.3% of the population) and positive individuals, or between the slow (60.9% of the population) and rapid acetylators. Among the slow acetylators, however, a significantly higher adduct level (P = 0.03) was obtained for the GSTM1-negative individuals as compared to the GSTM1-positive individuals.

7543329,"Prostatic aperture resulting from visual laser ablation: classification system based on follow-up endoscopy. To study the evolving prostatic aperture created by visual laser ablation (VLAP), we performed 38 video-endoscopies in 24 men with prostatism at various intervals 2 weeks to 1 year after treatment. Complete healing was generally observed within 3 to 4 months, never before 6 weeks; and in some patients, tissue sloughing was still apparent beyond 6 months. By review of the cystoscopic findings and video hard copies, three independent observers classified the healed prostatic apertures with great uniformity into one of four categories: (I) minimal change (lateral lobes still meet in midline throughout gland length) (N = 3); (II) minor aperture (opening less than 50% of cystoscopic field over less than 50% of gland length) (N = 5); (III) major aperture (opening more than 50% of cystoscopic field over more than 50% of gland length) (N = 11); and (IV) full ablation (nearly complete replacement of lobar configuration with a general concavity) (N = 5). Clinical outcomes (symptom scores, uroflow rates) matched with follow-up cystoscopic categories but not with any other readily identifiable measures. The four-category system proved to be simple, reproducible, and clinically relevant.

7543274,"Renal allograft rejection in children and young adults: the Banff classification. In the Banff classification, arteritis and tubulitis are regarded as the principal histological lesions indicating acute renal allograft rejection. To test this claim, we examined 51 biopsies obtained from 21 children and young adults with transplant rejection. Two reviewers, blind to the clinical course, graded the biopsies according to the Banff scheme. In patients without significant tubulitis (borderline changes), rejection tended to be reversed easily (88%), often with methylprednisolone pulse (52%). In patients with arteritis or significant tubulitis (Banff I-III), rejection was reversed in only 23% (P < 0.001), in 9% with steroids, and in 14% with OKT3.

7543048,"Distinct tissue distribution in pigs of tenascin-X and tenascin-C transcripts. Tenascin-X and tenascin-C glycoproteins are phylogenetically conserved components of the extracellular matrix, although their specific roles remain to be determined. cDNA probes were produced from pig tenascin-X and tenascin-C genes and were used to examine the tissue distribution of the transcripts in 28 tissues from Large-White pigs, 4.5-42-months old (called adults) and 17 tissues from 87-day-old fetuses. The hybridization of Northern blots with tenascin-X probes revealed, in most tissues, a complex pattern of bands including a major band of about 13 kb, assumed to correspond to the main tenascin-X transcript. Hybridization with the tenascin-C probe showed two transcripts of 6.8 kb and 8.2 kb. The data from the ribonuclease-protection technique showed that both genes displayed large variations in the transcription levels among the tissues analysed. Overall, the tenascin-X gene was significantly expressed in two thirds of the tissues, and the tenascin-C gene in about 50% of them. The highest tenascin-X signals were observed in tendons, ligaments and, unexpectedly, in peripheral nerves. Other tissues, including colon, dermis, skin, heart, uterus, stomach, jejunum, placentae, aorta, lung, mammary and adrenal glands also exhibited significant signal intensities. In fetuses, mainly testes and skeletal muscle showed higher transcription levels than the adult counterparts. The tenascin-C gene was predominantly transcribed in the ligament, tendon, adrenal gland and colon, and more weakly in the stomach, jejunum, lung and spinal cord. In fetuses, the tenascin-C signal in the brain was higher than the signal in the brain of adult, whereas the reverse was true for the adrenal gland and the colon. Within a given tissue, the level of tenascin-X and tenascin-C transcripts varied greatly, indicating independent tenascin-X and tenascin-C transcription regulation mechanisms; this was particularly obvious in adult and fetal nerves but also in the dermis, skin, heart, uterus, placentae and aorta, where tenascin-X RNA molecules were much more abundant than those of tenascin-C. In addition, similar differences were observed in the skeletal muscle and adrenal gland of fetuses. In contrast, the amount of tenascin-C transcripts in the fetal brain and adult spinal cord was higher than those for tenascin-X. Our results draw attention to a possible specific role of tenascin-X in the peripheral nerve physiology.",Immunology,distinct tissue distribution pig tenascinx tenascinc transcript tenascinx tenascinc glycoprotein phylogenetically conserved component extracellular matrix although specific role remain determined cdna probe produced pig tenascinx tenascinc gene used examine tissue distribution transcript tissue largewhite pig month old called adult tissue dayold fetus hybridization northern blot tenascinx probe revealed tissue complex pattern band including major band kb assumed correspond main tenascinx transcript hybridization tenascinc probe showed two transcript kb kb data ribonucleaseprotection technique showed gene displayed large variation transcription level among tissue analysed overall tenascinx gene significantly expressed two third tissue tenascinc gene highest tenascinx signal observed tendon ligament unexpectedly peripheral nerve tissue including colon dermis skin heart uterus stomach jejunum placenta aorta lung mammary adrenal gland also exhibited significant signal intensity fetus mainly testis skeletal muscle showed higher transcription level adult counterpart tenascinc gene predominantly transcribed ligament tendon adrenal gland colon weakly stomach jejunum lung spinal cord fetus tenascinc signal brain higher signal brain adult whereas reverse true adrenal gland colon within given tissue level tenascinx tenascinc transcript varied greatly indicating independent tenascinx tenascinc transcription regulation mechanism particularly obvious adult fetal nerve also dermis skin heart uterus placenta aorta tenascinx rna molecule much abundant tenascinc addition similar difference observed skeletal muscle adrenal gland fetus contrast amount tenascinc transcript fetal brain adult spinal cord higher tenascinx result draw attention possible specific role tenascinx peripheral nerve physiology
7542605,"Selective killing of T cells by immunotoxins directed at distinct V beta epitopes of the T cell receptor. The potency and specificity of anti-T cell receptor (TcR)-directed immunotoxins were studied in two T cell leukemia lines, HPB-ALL and Jurkat, and in primary T cells. Immunoconjugates were synthesized using anti-CD3, or distinct anti-V beta antibodies cross-linked to CRM9, a binding site-mutant of diphtheria toxin. All TcR-expressing cells display the CD3 complex on the plasma membrane. HPB-ALL cells express the V beta 5 gene product in the beta subunit of the TcR, while Jurkat cells express V beta 8. V beta expression in primary T cells isolated from buffy coats is heterogeneous. Primary T cell populations expressing specific V beta epitopes in the TcR were generated by plating CD3+ T cells on V beta-specific antibody-coated flasks or by positive immunomagnetic selection. Immunotoxins directed against the invariant CD3 epsilon epitope target and kill all T cells. Immunoconjugates targeted at distinct anti-V beta epitopes are specific for cells that express the corresponding gene product in the TcR. The results demonstrate the ability of anti-TcR-based immunotoxins selectively to kill T cells with defined V beta epitopes.

7542348,"Structural changes in base-paired region 28 in 16 S rRNA close to the decoding region of the 30 S ribosomal subunit are correlated to changes in tRNA binding. Escherichia coli 30 S ribosomal subunits undergo a reversible change under low monovalent or divalent cation concentration and become inactive in tRNA binding and 50 S subunit association. In the inactive form, 16 S rRNA base-pairs (921-922).(1395-1396) and (923-925).(1391-1393), which are part of region 28, are unstable and an alternate arrangement, (921-923).(1532-1534), is detected by psoralen photochemical crosslinking. Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to investigate whether changes in base-paired region 28 or the alternate secondary structure is responsible for the inactivity of the subunit. 30 S subunits with the substitution C1533A or with deletion of nucleotides 1534 to 1542 can still be inactivated like the wild-type 30 S subunit. On the other hand, 30 S subunits that contain sequence changes in the 920 to 926 region show moderate to severe decreases in tRNA binding even under activating conditions. When 30 S subunits containing these mutations were subjected to chemical probing, they failed to show the normal hyper-reactivity of nucleotide G926 and, instead, reactivity was shifted to G925 or to G928, and G929. Two mutations in the 920 region result in structures in which A1394 is base-paired rather than being unpaired as normal; deletion but not substitution of A1394 resulted in loss of tRNA binding activity and depression of the reactivity of G926. Mutations were made to insert or delete a nucleotide at position 920. The deletion mutant but not the insertion mutant has decreased tRNA binding activity and also low reactivity of G926. We conclude that structural changes in region 28 account for the active/inactive difference in tRNA binding. Molecular models of region 28 were made using the program MC-SYM. Models that include a hydrogen bond interaction between A1394 and G1392 account for the G926 reactivity in the wild-type sequence and account for the effects of most of the mutations in changing the G926 reactivity.",Immunology,structural change basepaired region rrna close decoding region ribosomal subunit correlated change trna binding escherichia coli ribosomal subunit undergo reversible change low monovalent divalent cation concentration become inactive trna binding subunit association inactive form rrna basepairs part region unstable alternate arrangement detected psoralen photochemical crosslinking sitedirected mutagenesis used investigate whether change basepaired region alternate secondary structure responsible inactivity subunit subunit substitution ca deletion nucleotide still inactivated like wildtype subunit hand subunit contain sequence change region show moderate severe decrease trna binding even activating condition subunit containing mutation subjected chemical probing failed show normal hyperreactivity nucleotide instead reactivity shifted two mutation region result structure basepaired rather unpaired normal deletion substitution resulted loss trna binding activity depression reactivity mutation made insert delete nucleotide position deletion mutant insertion mutant decreased trna binding activity also low reactivity conclude structural change region account activeinactive difference trna binding molecular model region made using program mcsym model include hydrogen bond interaction account reactivity wildtype sequence account effect mutation changing reactivity
7542324,"Identification by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of an adduct between pure pig plasma benzylamine oxidase and the inhibitor 3,5-diethoxy-4-aminomethylpyridine. 3,5-Diethoxy-4-aminomethylpyridine (B24) interacts with pure pig plasma benzylamine oxidase (BAO), giving a Schiff base with the carbonyl active site. This Schiff base was reduced, isolated by chemical hydrolysis of the enzyme, purified by HPLC and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after derivatization. The isolated B24 adduct had the same absorption spectrum, retention time on HPLC and GC and the same mass spectrum as B24-pyridoxamine. B24, which is a reversible enzyme inhibitor, is also a weak substrate and competes with benzylamine, which is the best substrate, for the active site.

7542313,"Increased nitric oxide synthase activities and L-[3H]arginine uptake in brain following portacaval anastomosis. Glutamatergic synaptic dysfunction has been proposed as a causal factor in portal-systemic encephalopathy. Increased in vitro and in vivo glutamate release and decreased glutamate binding to NMDA receptors were previously reported in the brains of portacaval-shunted rats. Such changes could lead to alterations in the second messenger systems coupled to glutamate receptors. As NMDA receptors have been shown to act via the nitric oxide/cyclic GMP second messenger system, we studied the activities of constitutive nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the brains of rats following portacaval shunting. Results demonstrate that NOS activities are significantly increased in cerebellum (by 54%, p < 0.01), cerebral cortex (by 65%, p < 0.01), hippocampus (by 88%, p < 0.01), and striatum (by 64%, p < 0.01) of shunted rats compared with sham-operated controls. As L-arginine transport is a prerequisite for nitric oxide production, we also studied L-[3H]arginine transport into cerebellar and cerebral cortical synaptosomes prepared from the brains of portacaval-shunted and sham-operated rats. L-[3H]Arginine uptake was significantly increased (by approximately 50%, p < 0.01) in both cerebellum and cortex. Increased NOS activities of neuronal and/or astrocytic origin and the resultant increased production of nitric oxide in brain could be the consequence of increased NMDA receptor activation following portacaval shunting. Furthermore, increased nitric oxide production could contribute to the increased cerebral blood flow consistently observed following portacaval shunting.",Immunology,increased nitric oxide synthase activity lharginine uptake brain following portacaval anastomosis glutamatergic synaptic dysfunction proposed causal factor portalsystemic encephalopathy increased vitro vivo glutamate release decreased glutamate binding nmda receptor previously reported brain portacavalshunted rat change lead alteration second messenger system coupled glutamate receptor nmda receptor shown act via nitric oxidecyclic gmp second messenger system studied activity constitutive nitric oxide synthase no brain rat following portacaval shunting result demonstrate no activity significantly increased cerebellum cerebral cortex hippocampus striatum shunted rat compared shamoperated control larginine transport prerequisite nitric oxide production also studied lharginine transport cerebellar cerebral cortical synaptosomes prepared brain portacavalshunted shamoperated rat lharginine uptake significantly increased approximately cerebellum cortex increased no activity neuronal andor astrocytic origin resultant increased production nitric oxide brain consequence increased nmda receptor activation following portacaval shunting furthermore increased nitric oxide production contribute increased cerebral blood flow consistently observed following portacaval shunting

Renal biopsy specimens from 54 children (33 boys, 21 girls) with IgA nephropathy were investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy to determine the localization of vitronectin and C5b-9. vitronectin and C5b-9 deposits were found within the glomeruli of all cases and the intensity of vitronectin and C5b-9 deposits was as follows: vitronectin: (3+) 17 cases, (2+) 21 cases, (1+) 16 cases and C5b-9: (3+) 28 cases, (2+) 18 cases, (1+) 8 cases. In 19 cases and C5b-9 deposits were shown to be more predominant than vitronectin (Group C) and the same or less intense in 35 cases (Group V). In 33 cases, vitronectin deposits were demonstrated in the mesangial area only (M type), while in 21 cases deposits were presented both the mesangial area and the capillary wall (MC type). Linear staining of vitronectin was noted in Bowman's basement membrane and in the tubular basement membrane. Granular staining of vitronectin was observed in Bowman's basement membrane (29 cases) and tubular basement membrane (46 cases). M type C5b-9 deposits were demonstrated in 34 cases and MC type in 20 cases. C5b-9 deposits were observed in Bowman's basement membrane (19 cases) and in tubular basement membrane (37 cases). Intensely stained vitronectin was found in the sclerotic glomeruli and segmental sclerotic portion of the tissues. In serial biopsy, the intensity of both vitronectin and C5b-9 deposits became less intense. It was found that many patients of Group C had heavy proteinuria (P < 0.05) and that nephrotic patients were more frequent in Group C than in Group V (p < 0.05). In the light microscopic examination, most cases with intense C5b-9 deposits had mesangial proliferation (p < 0.10) and an increase in mesangial matrix (p < 0.10). Mesangial sclerosis index was correlated with the intensity of vitronectin deposits (p < 0.05).

7541335,"Lenograstim. A review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic efficacy in neutropenia and related clinical settings. Lenograstim is a recombinant glycosylated human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rHuG-CSF) which principally regulates the formation and function of neutrophils. Like other colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), lenograstim has been developed for the prevention and treatment of iatrogenic and disease-related neutropenic conditions. In phase III clinical studies, prophylactic administration of lenograstim shortened the duration of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in patients with nonmyelogenous cancers who received standard-dose chemotherapy or myeloablative regimens followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT). A decrease in the incidence of infection after standard regimens and fewer days with infectious and febrile neutropenic episodes during recovery from BMT occurred concomitantly with the amelioration of neutropenia. In each setting, the decrease in morbidity was associated with shorter hospitalisation times and reduced administration of parenteral antibacterial agents. As with another rHuG-CSF, filgrastim, bone pain (non-serious) was the most common adverse reaction to lenograstim therapy. This occurred in 13% of lenograstim recipients and 5% of placebo recipients treated for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia with standard regimens. Lenograstim may facilitate dose optimisation and permit limited dose intensification of standard chemotherapy. Furthermore, the drug, used alone or in combination with chemotherapy, is effective in mobilising peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) for subsequent reinfusion. The latter is a promising technique which may supplement or ultimately replace BMT for stem cell rescue after myeloablative chemotherapy. However, it has yet to be established whether the dose intensification achievable with lenograstim and/or stem cell rescue has a material effect on relapse-free and survival times. Preliminary data suggest that lenograstim is effective in increasing the neutrophil count in patients with severe chronic neutropenia (Kostmann's syndrome), as well as patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex with zidovudine-induced neutropenia. Thus, lenograstim, like other CSFs, is a valuable adjunct to cytotoxic chemotherapy for the treatment of nonmyelogenous cancers, including myeloablative regimens followed by stem cell rescue with BMT and/or PBPC infusion. Future clinical experience is likely to confirm the usefulness of the drug in the management of disease-related neutropenia, myeloid disorders and neutropenia in patients with AIDS.",Immunology,lenograstim review pharmacological property therapeutic efficacy neutropenia related clinical setting lenograstim recombinant glycosylated human granulocyte colonystimulating factor rhugcsf principally regulates formation function neutrophil like colonystimulating factor csfs lenograstim developed prevention treatment iatrogenic diseaserelated neutropenic condition phase iii clinical study prophylactic administration lenograstim shortened duration chemotherapyinduced neutropenia patient nonmyelogenous cancer received standarddose chemotherapy myeloablative regimen followed bone marrow transplantation bmt decrease incidence infection standard regimen fewer day infectious febrile neutropenic episode recovery bmt occurred concomitantly amelioration neutropenia setting decrease morbidity associated shorter hospitalisation time reduced administration parenteral antibacterial agent another rhugcsf filgrastim bone pain nonserious common adverse reaction lenograstim therapy occurred lenograstim recipient placebo recipient treated chemotherapyinduced neutropenia standard regimen lenograstim may facilitate dose optimisation permit limited dose intensification standard chemotherapy furthermore drug used alone combination chemotherapy effective mobilising peripheral blood progenitor cell pbpcs subsequent reinfusion latter promising technique may supplement ultimately replace bmt stem cell rescue myeloablative chemotherapy however yet established whether dose intensification achievable lenograstim andor stem cell rescue material effect relapsefree survival time preliminary data suggest lenograstim effective increasing neutrophil count patient severe chronic neutropenia kostmanns syndrome well patient aid aidsrelated complex zidovudineinduced neutropenia thus lenograstim like csfs valuable adjunct cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment nonmyelogenous cancer including myeloablative regimen followed stem cell rescue bmt andor pbpc infusion future clinical experience likely confirm usefulness drug management diseaserelated neutropenia myeloid disorder neutropenia patient aid

7541235,"Intensification of chemotherapy for the treatment of solid tumours: feasibility of a 3-fold increase in dose intensity with peripheral blood progenitor cells and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Dose intensity may be an important determinant of the outcome in cancer chemotherapy, but is often limited by cumulative haematological toxicity. The availability of haematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and of peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation has allowed the development of a new treatment strategy in which several courses of high-dose combination chemotherapy are administered for the treatment of solid tumours. PBPCs were mobilised before chemotherapy using 12 or 30 micrograms kg-1 day-1 G-CSF (Filgrastim) for 10 days, and were collected by 2-5 leucaphereses. The yields of mononuclear cells, colony-forming units and CD34-positive cells were similar at the two dose levels of Filgrastim, and the numbers of PBPCs were sufficient for rescue following multiple cycles of chemotherapy. High-dose chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 2.5 g m-2 for 2 days, etoposide 300 mg m-2 for 3 days and cisplatin 50 mg m-2 for 3 days) was administered sequentially for a median of three cycles (range 1-4) to ten patients. Following the 30 evaluable cycles, the median duration of leucopenia < or = 0.5 x 10(9) l-1 and < or = 1.0 x 10(9) l-1 was 7 and 8 days respectively. The median time of thrombopenia < or = 20 x 10(9) l-1 was 6 days. There was no cumulative haematological toxicity. The duration of leucopenia, but not of thrombopenia, was inversely related to the number of reinfused CFU-GM (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units). In the majority of patients, neurotoxicity and ototoxicity became dose limiting after three cycles of therapy. However, the average dose intensity delivered was about three times higher than in a standard regimen. The complete response rate in patients with small-cell lung cancers was 66% (95% CI 30-92%) and the median progression-free survival and overall survival were 13 months and 17 months respectively.

7541220,"Expression of immunoreactive and bioactive activin A protein in adult murine lung after bleomycin treatment. Activin A is a homodimeric protein structurally and functionally related to transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), and the expression of activin A is modulated by TGF-beta. Here, we demonstrate the expression of activin A in normal and bleomycin (BLM)-treated murine lungs. ICR mice were treated with BLM intraperitoneally for 10 days, whereas saline vehicle was injected into control mice. Intra-alveolar fibrotic changes were observed in the lung tissue obtained from the mice at day 14 after the final BLM administration. Immunohistochemical studies using a polyclonal antibody to activin A revealed the presence of activin A in the bronchiolar epithelium and smooth muscle cells of veins in both control and BLM-treated mice. In the BLM-treated mice at days 7 and 14, the marked infiltration of immunoreactive alveolar macrophages was observed in the area of fibrotic changes. Bioactivity of activin A measured by erythroid differentiation factor assay in the conditioned medium of alveolar macrophages obtained from BLM-treated mice at day 14 was significantly increased. These findings indicate that alveolar macrophages are a potent source of activin A after BLM treatment. The present study demonstrates for the first time the abundant expression of activin A in murine lung tissues after BLM administration, suggesting that activin A may play a role in the pathogenesis of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis.",Immunology,expression immunoreactive bioactive activin protein adult murine lung bleomycin treatment activin homodimeric protein structurally functionally related transforming growth factor beta tgfbeta expression activin modulated tgfbeta demonstrate expression activin normal bleomycin blmtreated murine lung icr mouse treated blm intraperitoneally day whereas saline vehicle injected control mouse intraalveolar fibrotic change observed lung tissue obtained mouse day final blm administration immunohistochemical study using polyclonal antibody activin revealed presence activin bronchiolar epithelium smooth muscle cell vein control blmtreated mouse blmtreated mouse day marked infiltration immunoreactive alveolar macrophage observed area fibrotic change bioactivity activin measured erythroid differentiation factor assay conditioned medium alveolar macrophage obtained blmtreated mouse day significantly increased finding indicate alveolar macrophage potent source activin blm treatment present study demonstrates first time abundant expression activin murine lung tissue blm administration suggesting activin may play role pathogenesis blminduced pulmonary fibrosis
7541200,"Sensitivity/resistance profile of a simian immunodeficiency virus containing the reverse transcriptase gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) toward the HIV-1-specific non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. To develop an animal model for the therapy of AIDS with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors, we recently constructed a hybrid simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/HIV-1 in which the RT gene of SIV was replaced by the RT gene of HIV-1. This chimaeric virus, designated RT-SHIV, was found to be markedly sensitive to the inhibitory effects of both nucleoside (ddN) and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs). In contrast, SIV was inhibited only by ddNs (i.e., 3TC and AZT), but not NNRTIs. When RT-SHIV was grown in the presence of 3TC, nevirapine, TSAO-m3T or the thiocarboxanilide UC-42 drug-resistant mutant virus strains emerged in cell culture as rapid as for HIV-1(IIIB). The antiviral sensitivity/resistance spectrum of the mutant RT-SHIV strains against NNRTIs and ddNs, and the nature of the mutations that appeared in their RT were similar to those of the mutant HIV-1 strains that were selected under identical experimental conditions.

7541098,"Impairment of intracellular antiviral defense with age: age-dependent changes in expression of interferon-induced and double-stranded RNA-activated 2-5A synthetase in rat. The 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A) system is involved in the defense of mammalian cells against virus infection. In a previous study [25], we demonstrated that the activities of the enzymes which synthesize and degrade 2-5A [2-5A synthetase (2-5OAS) and 2',3'-exoribonuclease] and of the enzyme that is activated by 2-5A (ribonuclease L) change during aging and development in different tissues of rat. The age-dependent decrease in 2-5OAS activity and increase in 2-5A nuclease activity results in a decrease in the cellular 2-5A content, suggesting that the efficiency of the antiviral 2-5A system is impaired in aged rats. Here we determined the age-dependent changes in the level of mRNA coding for the class I isoenzyme of 2-5OAS (M(r) 40-46 kDa) in rat liver and brain using a cDNA which was recently cloned from rat hippocampus. We found that the decrease in 2-5OAS activity is accompanied by a decrease in the level of 2-5OAS mRNA; in old animals (32-33 months old), the amount of 2-5OAS mRNA was reduced to 20-30% compared to young adult (2-3 months old) (100%) and middle-aged adult animals (12 months old) (110-120%). In addition, Western-blotting experiments revealed that the amount of class I 2-5OAS capable of binding to its activator, poly(I).poly(C), is also diminished in the livers and brains of old rats compared to those of young adult and middle-aged adult animals.",Immunology,impairment intracellular antiviral defense age agedependent change expression interferoninduced doublestranded rnaactivated synthetase rat oligoadenylate system involved defense mammalian cell virus infection previous study demonstrated activity enzyme synthesize degrade synthetase oas exoribonuclease enzyme activated ribonuclease change aging development different tissue rat agedependent decrease oas activity increase nuclease activity result decrease cellular content suggesting efficiency antiviral system impaired aged rat determined agedependent change level mrna coding class isoenzyme oas mr kda rat liver brain using cdna recently cloned rat hippocampus found decrease oas activity accompanied decrease level oas mrna old animal month old amount oas mrna reduced compared young adult month old middleaged adult animal month old addition westernblotting experiment revealed amount class oas capable binding activator polyipolyc also diminished liver brain old rat compared young adult middleaged adult animal
7541043,"Expression of a constitutive mutant of iron regulatory protein 1 abolishes iron homeostasis in mammalian cells. Iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) are iron-sensing proteins that bind to RNA stem-loop sequences known as iron-responsive elements (IREs) when cells are depleted of iron. Although IRPs have been shown to bind to IREs derived from ferritin and transferrin receptor (TfR) mRNAs in vitro, there has not been a direct demonstration of the impact of a recombinant IRP on the expression of endogenous IRE-containing transcripts. In this study, we evaluate the impact of expression of C437S, a mutant of IRP1 that binds IREs regardless of cellular iron status, on the regulation of biosynthesis of ferritin and TfR. Despite being made iron-replete, cells expressing C437S continue to synthesize and express high amounts of TfR, while the synthesis of ferritin is repressed. Thus, a single mutant IRP can prevent the usual homeostatic changes in ferritin and TfR biosynthesis. Cells expressing the mutant protein would therefore be predicted to be unable to defend against iron overload. Preliminary results show that cells treated with iron have diminished cell survival when C437S is expressed, and we have thus created a tissue culture model system for the study of iron toxicity.",Immunology,expression constitutive mutant iron regulatory protein abolishes iron homeostasis mammalian cell iron regulatory protein irps ironsensing protein bind rna stemloop sequence known ironresponsive element ire cell depleted iron although irps shown bind ire derived ferritin transferrin receptor tfr mrna vitro direct demonstration impact recombinant irp expression endogenous irecontaining transcript study evaluate impact expression c mutant irp bind ire regardless cellular iron status regulation biosynthesis ferritin tfr despite made ironreplete cell expressing c continue synthesize express high amount tfr synthesis ferritin repressed thus single mutant irp prevent usual homeostatic change ferritin tfr biosynthesis cell expressing mutant protein therefore predicted unable defend iron overload preliminary result show cell treated iron diminished cell survival c expressed thus created tissue culture model system study iron toxicity

7540430,"Cell volume measured by total internal reflection microfluorimetry: application to water and solute transport in cells transfected with water channel homologs. Total internal reflection (TIR) microfluorimetry was established as a method to measure continuously the volume of adherent cells and applied to measure membrane permeabilities in cells transfected with water channel homologs. Cytosol was labeled with the membrane-impermeant fluorophore calcein. Fluorescence was excited by the TIR evanescent field in a thin section of cytosol (approximately 150 nm) adjacent to the cell-substrate interface. Because cytosolic fluorophore number per cell remains constant, the TIR fluorescence signal should be inversely related to cell volume. For small volume changes in Sf-9 and LLC-PK1 cells, relative TIR fluorescence was nearly equal to inverse relative cell volume; deviations from the ideal were modeled theoretically. To measure plasma membrane osmotic water permeability, Pf, the time course of osmotically induced cell volume change was inferred from the TIR fluorescence signal. LLC-PK1 cells expressing the CHIP28 water channel had an HgCl2-sensitive, threefold increase in Pf compared to nontransfected cells (Pf = 0.0043 cm/s at 10 degrees C). Solute permeability was measured from the TIR fluorescence time course in response to solute gradients. Glycerol permeability in Sf-9 cells expressing the water channel homolog GLIP was (1.3 +/- 0.2) x 10(-5) cm/s (22 degrees C), greater than that of (0.36 +/- 0.04) x 10(-5) cm/s (n = 4, p < 0.05) for control cells, indicating functional expression of GLIP.

7540139,"Phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis is involved in production of Ca(2+)-dependent currents, but not non-selective cation currents, by muscarine in chromaffin cells. Whether phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and a subsequent Ca2+ mobilization are responsible for muscarine-induced transient outward currents (IO) and non-selective cation currents (INS) in the guinea-pig chromaffin cell was investigated using the perforated patch method. IO, but not INS, failed to be reproduced in Ca(2+)-free solution and was markedly reduced by prior exposure to caffeine under Ca(2+)-free conditions or by addition to normal solution of cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), a Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor. Application of CPA in Ca(2+)-free solution, however, suppressed INS by about 50% in 73% of the cells tested. Bath application of 1.5 mM neomycin, a phospholipase C inhibitor, induced the time-dependent decline of IO with near abolition at 20 min or less, whereas it produced a time-independent decrease of INS and an inwardly rectifying K+ current. INS in the presence or absence of neomycin was well fitted to rectangular hyperbolas with the same ED50 of 2.17 microM, but with a 33% smaller maximum amplitude in the former, indicating a non-competitive inhibition by neomycin.

The first 16 liver transplants carried out without aprotinin (control group) were compared with the next 26 consecutive transplant patients who received aprotinin. Each of the first 9 received a loading dose of 2 million units that was followed by the infusion of half a million units per hour until the end of surgery. The next 17 received the same infusion dose at the same rate but no loading dose. Patients who received aprotinin required fewer transfusions of blood products (5.3 units of packed red blood cells as opposed to 13 units; 9 units of fresh frozen plasma versus 14.6 units; 1.7 units of platelets versus 4.2 units; and 3.8 units of cryoprecipitates versus 8.8 units).

GDP-L-fucose:beta-D-galactoside alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.69) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of fucosylated type 1 and 2 lactoseries structures, such as Lewis b and the H type 2 and Lewis Y, respectively, that are accumulated in colon adenocarcinoma.

A variable increase in mRNA transcript levels was observed in 50% of adenomatous polyps. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the protein coding region of the cDNAs derived from normal colon, adenoma, and colon adenocarcinoma revealed 100% homology, suggesting that there are no tumor-associated allelic variations within the H beta-D-galactoside alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferase cDNA.

Nitric oxide synthase in lumbar dorsal root ganglia of neonatal rat was studied by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase and in situ hybridization histochemistry. Induction of nitric oxide synthase in neonatal capsaicin-treated rats after sciatic axotomy was compared with the axotomy-induced nitric oxide synthase increase observed in vehicle-treated littermates. In neonatal capsaicin-treated animals, the number of neurons constitutively labeled by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase was greatly reduced as compared to vehicle-treated littermates. Nitric oxide synthase messenger RNA was not readily identified constitutively in dorsal root ganglion neurons. Seven days after sciatic transection the induction of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase and nitric oxide synthase messenger RNA found in the vehicle-treated group was not observed in the capsaicin group. The presence of nitric oxide synthase in dorsal root ganglion neurons thus does not appear to protect against Ca(2+)-mediated capsaicin-induced cytotoxicity. However, since some nitric oxide synthase dorsal root ganglion neurons persist after the capsaicin neurotoxicity, nitric oxide synthase expression must occur in a neurochemically diverse subpopulation of small (< 1000 microns2) neurons.

Asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias in patients with congestive heart failure are associated with increased rates of overall mortality and sudden death. Amiodarone is now used widely to prevent ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. We conducted a trial to determine whether amiodarone can reduce overall mortality in patients with congestive heart failure and asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias. We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol in which 674 patients with symptoms of congestive heart failure, cardiac enlargement, 10 or more premature ventricular contractions per hour, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40 percent or less were randomly assigned to receive amiodarone (336 patients) or placebo (338 patients). The primary end point was overall mortality, and the median follow-up was 45 months (range, 0 to 54). There was no significant difference in overall mortality between the two treatment groups (P = 0.6). The two-year actuarial survival rate was 69.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 64.2 to 74.6) for the patients in the amiodarone group and 70.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 65.7 to 75.9) for those in the placebo group. At two years, the rate of sudden death was 15 percent in the amiodarone group and 19 percent in the placebo group (P = 0.43). There was a trend toward a reduction in overall mortality among the patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy who received amiodarone (P = 0.07). Amiodarone was significantly more effective in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias and increased the left ventricular ejection fraction by 42 percent at two years. Although amiodarone was effective in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias and improving ventricular function, it did not reduce the incidence of sudden death or prolong survival among patients with heart failure, except for a trend toward reduced mortality among those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.",Immunology,amiodarone patient congestive heart failure asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmia survival trial antiarrhythmic therapy congestive heart failure asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmia patient congestive heart failure associated increased rate overall mortality sudden death amiodarone used widely prevent ventricular tachycardia fibrillation conducted trial determine whether amiodarone reduce overall mortality patient congestive heart failure asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmia used doubleblind placebocontrolled protocol patient symptom congestive heart failure cardiac enlargement premature ventricular contraction per hour left ventricular ejection fraction percent le randomly assigned receive amiodarone patient placebo patient primary end point overall mortality median followup month range significant difference overall mortality two treatment group twoyear actuarial survival rate percent percent confidence interval patient amiodarone group percent percent confidence interval placebo group two year rate sudden death percent amiodarone group percent placebo group trend toward reduction overall mortality among patient nonischemic cardiomyopathy received amiodarone amiodarone significantly effective suppressing ventricular arrhythmia increased left ventricular ejection fraction percent two year although amiodarone effective suppressing ventricular arrhythmia improving ventricular function reduce incidence sudden death prolong survival among patient heart failure except trend toward reduced mortality among nonischemic cardiomyopathy

A series of aniline mustards and half-mustards targeted to DNA by linkage (through a polymethylene chain) to the bisbenzimidazole chromophore of pibenzimol (Hoechst 33258) have been evaluated for their mutagenic properties, as estimated in three strains of Salmonella typhimurium, and for their mitotic crossing-over and petite mutagenesis activities in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain D5. Agarose gel electrophoresis studies showed that only the derivative with the longest linker chain cross-linked DNA, with the remaining compounds being monoalkylators. The parent (non-alkylator) minor groove binding ligand (Hoechst 33258) was inactive in the bacterial strains TA98 or TA100 but weakly mutagenic in TA102, and caused neither mitotic crossing-over nor 'petite' mutagenesis in yeast. Aniline half-mustard itself (monoalkylator) was an effective base-pair substitution mutagen (events in S. typhimurium strain TA100) with some frameshift mutagenesis activity in TA98, but showed only weak effects in the yeast assays, whereas aniline mustard (cross-linker) was inactive in these bacterial systems but caused substantial amounts of mitotic crossing-over in yeast. The composite molecules studied here showed effects more characteristic of the minor groove binding chromophore than of alkylating moieties. All showed weak mutagenic activity in TA102 and none in TA98. The only compound to show significant mitotic crossing-over ability was the long-chain derivative which cross-linked DNA. For most of the compounds, the mutagenicity data provided no supportive evidence for DNA alkylation.

7533866,"Cytokine treatment of human bone marrow activates anti-leukaemia effector cells: monitoring of purging by polymerase chain reaction and DNA analysis. The aims of this study were to investigate the role of cytokines (tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interferon gamma (IFN gamma) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) in augmenting graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL). We have investigated the effector cells involved in GVL, by studying the role of these cells in purging of the cell line K562 in short-term bone marrow cultures. The effect of the addition in vitro of rGCSF was also studied. Monitoring of purging was achieved by cytotoxicity assays, DNA analysis and the use of the polymerase chain reaction for the detection of bcr/abl transcripts in the Philadelphia positive (Ph+) K562 cell line. Supernatants from IL-2-treated and non-treated bone marrow were tested for cytokine production (TNF alpha and IFN gamma). The results have shown that the main cytotoxic effector cells in the bone marrow generated by IL-2 have the CD56+ CD8+ phenotype. Overnight incubation of bone marrow was sufficient to generate cytotoxic cells as measured by Chromium51 (Cr51) release assays. Measurable levels of TNF alpha but not IFN gamma were also detected in supernatants. Addition of TNF alpha and IFN gamma to the IL-2 in the bone marrow cultures augmented the cytotoxicity but tended to inhibit progenitor cell growth as measured by granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (GM-CFU) and erythroid blast-forming unit (BFU-e) assays. An estimate of the purging of the marrow could also be achieved by DNA analysis of K562 DNA in bone marrow. The bcr/abl transcript could still be detected by PCR analysis in marrow containing 1% K562 and treated with IL-2 for 24 h, but by 6 days of incubation the bcr/abl transcript was weak or undectable.

7531777,"Gender-dependent differences in hepatic tumor promotion in diethylnitrosamine initiated infant B6C3F1 mice by alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane. Chronic exposure of B6C3F1 mice to phenobarbital (PB), subsequent to a single initiating dose of diethylnitrosamine (DENA) at 15 d of age, has been previously shown to inhibit hepatic tumorigenesis in male mice, while promoting hepatic tumor formation in female mice (Weghorst & Klaunig, 1989). In the present study, the effects of another hepatic tumor promoter, alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH), in similarly initiated B6C3F1 mice was investigated. Male and female mice received a single intraperitoneal (ip) injection of either DENA or saline at 15 d of age. Beginning at 28 d of age, the mice received either alpha-HCH in the diet (250 ppm) or untreated basal diet. Like PB, alpha-HCH inhibited hepatic tumorigenesis in male mice, while promoting hepatic tumor formation in female mice following chronic exposure. In an additional experiment, already formed preneoplastic hepatic foci in male and female B6C3F1 mice were examined for their responsiveness to the induction of DNA synthesis by alpha-HCH treatment. The mice received a single ip injection of DENA at 15 d of age to induce hepatocellular foci. Beginning at 24 wk of age, mice received either basal diet or diet containing 250 ppm alpha-HCH for 7 consecutive d. DNA synthesis was assessed by continuous [3H]thymidine infusion via subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps. In female mice treated with alpha-HCH, DNA synthesis in hepatocellular foci was increased substantially compared to untreated females. In contrast, male mice receiving alpha-HCH showed no increase in DNA synthesis in hepatocellular foci from that seen in non-alpha-HCH-treated males. Based on these results, we postulate that the gender-dependent differences in hepatic tumorigenesis observed in B6C3F1 mice initiated during infancy may be related to chemical tumor promoter modulation of the normal hormonal environment, or to differences in the ability of hepatocellular foci to respond to the induction of DNA synthesis by the tumor promoter.",Immunology,genderdependent difference hepatic tumor promotion diethylnitrosamine initiated infant bcf mouse alphahexachlorocyclohexane chronic exposure bcf mouse phenobarbital pb subsequent single initiating dose diethylnitrosamine dena age previously shown inhibit hepatic tumorigenesis male mouse promoting hepatic tumor formation female mouse weghorst klaunig present study effect another hepatic tumor promoter alphahexachlorocyclohexane alphahch similarly initiated bcf mouse investigated male female mouse received single intraperitoneal ip injection either dena saline age beginning age mouse received either alphahch diet ppm untreated basal diet like pb alphahch inhibited hepatic tumorigenesis male mouse promoting hepatic tumor formation female mouse following chronic exposure additional experiment already formed preneoplastic hepatic focus male female bcf mouse examined responsiveness induction dna synthesis alphahch treatment mouse received single ip injection dena age induce hepatocellular focus beginning wk age mouse received either basal diet diet containing ppm alphahch consecutive dna synthesis assessed continuous hthymidine infusion via subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps female mouse treated alphahch dna synthesis hepatocellular focus increased substantially compared untreated female contrast male mouse receiving alphahch showed increase dna synthesis hepatocellular focus seen nonalphahchtreated male based result postulate genderdependent difference hepatic tumorigenesis observed bcf mouse initiated infancy may related chemical tumor promoter modulation normal hormonal environment difference ability hepatocellular focus respond induction dna synthesis tumor promoter

While other components such as collagen IV, laminin and the core protein of proteoglycan could be found, the D28 epitope could not be found in the basement membrane of renal cysts formed in adult-type (DBA/2FG-pcy) and infant-type (C57BL/6J-cpk) PKD mice. The D28 epitope did not, however, disappear from the basement membrane of proximal tubules in other types of renal abnormalities. These results suggest that the formation of renal cysts in the proximal tubules is associated with an alteration to the proximal tubule-specific structure of the basement membrane.

7528130,"Treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma. Current guidelines and future perspectives. Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common malignancy associated with HIV infection, and the morbidity and mortality attributable to AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (AIDS-KS) may be increasing. No curative therapy is available for AIDS-KS, but palliative therapy can eliminate or reduce cosmetically unacceptable lesions, reduce painful or unsightly oedema or lymphadenopathy, shrink symptomatic oral lesions and relieve symptoms caused by visceral involvement. Strategies currently employed to treat the various clinical problems encountered in AIDS-KS include single- and multi-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy, treatment with interferon-alpha, radiotherapy, and other local therapies. Current clinical research is focusing on use of liposome-encapsulated cytotoxic agents and treatment with substances that inhibit angiogenesis. Any treatment plan for AIDS-KS must be flexible and must be based on the patient's overall clinical and immunological status as well as therapeutic goals. Limited local disease is usually amenable to treatment with local measures. Extensive, symptomatic AIDS-KS warrants systemic treatment. The response of mucocutaneous lesions to low dose systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy is typically excellent. Treatment with interferon-alpha may also be beneficial in this setting. Multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimens are usually reserved for treatment of patients most severely affected by AIDS-KS.

7508874,"Search for a third susceptibility gene for maturity-onset diabetes of the young. Studies with eleven candidate genes. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a model for genetic studies of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We have identified 15 MODY families in which diabetes is not the result of mutations in the glucokinase gene. This cohort of families will be useful for identifying other diabetes-susceptibility genes. Nine other candidate genes potentially implicated in insulin secretion or insulin action have been tested for linkage with MODY in these families, including glucokinase regulatory protein, hexokinase II, insulin receptor substrate 1, fatty acid-binding protein 2, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor, apolipoprotein C-II, glycogen synthase, adenosine deaminase (a marker for the MODY gene on chromosome 20), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. None of these loci showed evidence for linkage with MODY, implying that mutations in these genes do not make a major genetic contribution to the development of MODY. In addition to these linkage analyses, one or two affected subjects from each family were screened for the presence of the A to G mutation at nucleotide 3,243 of the mitochondrial tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene. This mutation was not found in any of these subjects.

In the current atmosphere of increasing fiscal awareness, laboratorians are carefully assessing which procedures should be performed in-house and which should be sent to a reference laboratory. Ultimately these decisions are based not only on cost but also on the patient population serviced and on technical and workload considerations in the individual laboratory. A simple rule of thumb is to be able to perform stains that are either needed frequently or are very easy to perform and interpret if needed emergently.

7539810,"The basal keratin network of stratified squamous epithelia: defining K15 function in the absence of K14. Keratin 5 and keratin 14 have been touted as the hallmarks of the basal keratin networks of all stratified squamous epithelia. Absence of K14 gives rise to epidermolysis bullosa simplex, a human blistering skin disorder involving cytolysis in the basal layer of epidermis. To address the puzzling question of why this disease is primarily manifested in skin rather than other stratified squamous epithelia, we ablated the K14 gene in mice and examined various tissues expressing this gene. We show that a key factor is the presence of another keratin, K15, which was hitherto unappreciated as a basal cell component. We show that the levels of K15 relative to K14 vary dramatically among stratified squamous epithelial tissues, and with neonatal development. In the absence of K14, K15 makes a bona fide, but ultrastructurally distinct, keratin filament network with K5. In the epidermis of neonatal mutant mice, K15 levels are low and do not compensate for the loss of K14. In contrast, the esophagus is unaffected in the neonatal mutant mice, but does appear to be fragile in the adult. Parallel to this phenomenon is that esophageal K14 is expressed at extremely low levels in the neonate, but rises in postnatal development. Finally, despite previous conclusions that the formation of suprabasal keratin filaments might depend upon K5/K14, we find that a wide variety of suprabasal networks composed of different keratins can form in the absence of K14 in the basal layer.",Immunology,basal keratin network stratified squamous epithelium defining function absence keratin keratin touted hallmark basal keratin network stratified squamous epithelium absence give rise epidermolysis bullosa simplex human blistering skin disorder involving cytolysis basal layer epidermis address puzzling question disease primarily manifested skin rather stratified squamous epithelium ablated gene mouse examined various tissue expressing gene show key factor presence another keratin hitherto unappreciated basal cell component show level relative vary dramatically among stratified squamous epithelial tissue neonatal development absence make bona fide ultrastructurally distinct keratin filament network epidermis neonatal mutant mouse level low compensate loss contrast esophagus unaffected neonatal mutant mouse appear fragile adult parallel phenomenon esophageal expressed extremely low level neonate rise postnatal development finally despite previous conclusion formation suprabasal keratin filament might depend upon kk find wide variety suprabasal network composed different keratin form absence basal layer
7539557,"Regulation of prostatic smooth muscle contractility by intracellular second messengers: implications for the conservative treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The increased sympathetic neurotransmission in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) results in a alpha 1C-adrenoceptor-mediated increase in prostatic smooth muscle tone which seems to be responsible for the dynamic infravesical obstruction occurring in BPH. The prostatic smooth muscle contractions evoked by norepinephrine can be efficiently blocked by alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockers. Moreover, an impressive number of clinical trials illustrated the beneficial results of alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockers in the treatment of BPH. However, despite knowledge of alpha 1-adrenergic neurotransmission and the clinical application of its blockade by selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, very little is known about the intracellular pathways involved in the regulation of prostatic smooth muscle contractility. To study the intracellular mechanism of the alpha 1C-adrenoceptor-induced prostatic smooth muscle contraction, the patch-clamp technique in the whole-cell configuration mode combined with the Fura-II fluorescence technique was used in human, enzymatically isolated smooth muscle cells obtained from patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate because of symptomatic BPH. Furthermore changes in prostatic smooth muscle contractility were registered in organ bath experiments. Application of the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (PE) increased the L-type Ca(2+)-channel current (ICa) dose dependently from 8 up to 18.5 microA/cm2, simultaneously elevating the free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) up to 1.9 microM. Pretreating the myocytes with pertussis toxin, an exotoxin of Bordetella pertussis which inactivates GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) of the Gi and G(o) family by ADP ribosylation, reduced the PE-induced ICa stimulation by 71.5 +/- 5.6% (n = 21). Dialysis of the cytosol with the second messenger inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which releases Ca2+ from intracellular non-mitochondrial, IP3-sensitive Ca2+ pools, imitated the PE-evoked responses. Pretreating the myocytes with the Ca(2+)-release blockers ryanodine (10-100 microM, n = 8), thapsigargin (0.1 microM, n = 11) or low-molecular weight heparin (n = 14) largely attenuated the PE-evoked responses. The experimental results suggest a coupling of alpha 1-adrenoceptors to phospholipase C-converting phosphoinositol-4,5-bisphosphate into diacylglycerol, an endogenous activator of the protein kinase C and IP3 which releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores stimulating ICa via Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase induced phosphorylation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. This knowledge could be of interest for conservative treatment in symptomatic BPH.",Immunology,regulation prostatic smooth muscle contractility intracellular second messenger implication conservative treatment benign prostatic hyperplasia increased sympathetic neurotransmission benign prostatic hyperplasia bph result alpha cadrenoceptormediated increase prostatic smooth muscle tone seems responsible dynamic infravesical obstruction occurring bph prostatic smooth muscle contraction evoked norepinephrine efficiently blocked alpha adrenoceptor blocker moreover impressive number clinical trial illustrated beneficial result alpha adrenoceptor blocker treatment bph however despite knowledge alpha adrenergic neurotransmission clinical application blockade selective alpha adrenoceptor antagonist little known intracellular pathway involved regulation prostatic smooth muscle contractility study intracellular mechanism alpha cadrenoceptorinduced prostatic smooth muscle contraction patchclamp technique wholecell configuration mode combined furaii fluorescence technique used human enzymatically isolated smooth muscle cell obtained patient undergoing transurethral resection prostate symptomatic bph furthermore change prostatic smooth muscle contractility registered organ bath experiment application selective alpha adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine pe increased ltype cachannel current ica dose dependently microacm simultaneously elevating free cytoplasmic ca concentration cai microm pretreating myocytes pertussis toxin exotoxin bordetella pertussis inactivates gtpbinding protein protein gi go family adp ribosylation reduced peinduced ica stimulation dialysis cytosol second messenger inositoltrisphosphate ip release ca intracellular nonmitochondrial ipsensitive ca pool imitated peevoked response pretreating myocytes carelease blocker ryanodine microm thapsigargin microm lowmolecular weight heparin largely attenuated peevoked response experimental result suggest coupling alpha adrenoceptors phospholipase cconverting phosphoinositolbisphosphate diacylglycerol endogenous activator protein kinase ip release ca intracellular store stimulating ica via cacalmodulindependent protein kinase induced phosphorylation voltagedependent ca channel knowledge interest conservative treatment symptomatic bph
7539063,"Differential effects of vincristine and phenytoin on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human glioma cell lines. The aim of this study was to investigate the antimigratory and antiinvasive potential of vincristine sulfate (VCR) on human glioma cells and to analyze whether phenytoin (5,5-diphenylhydantoin; DPH) might act synergistically with VCR. Vincristine affects the cytoplasmic microtubules; DPH has been reported to enhance VCR cytotoxicity in murine cells. In two human glioma cell lines, GaMG and D-37MG, we found VCR to reduce monolayer growth and colony formation in a dose-dependent fashion at concentrations of 10 ng/ml and above. Phenytoin increased the cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of VCR in monolayer cells but not in spheroids. Multicellular spheroids were used to investigate directional migration. A coculture system of GaMG and D-37MG spheroids with fetal rat brain aggregates was used to analyze and quantify tumor cell invasion. A dose-dependent inhibition of migration and invasion by VCR was observed in both cell lines without further enhancement by DPH. Immunofluorescence microscopy with antibodies against alpha-tubulin revealed dose-dependent morphological alterations in the microtubules when the cells were exposed to VCR but not after incubation with DPH. Based on the combination of standardized in vitro model systems currently in use and the present data, the authors strongly suggest that VCR inhibits migration and invasion of human glioma cells. This is not altered by DPH, which inhibits cell proliferation in combination with VCR.",Immunology,differential effect vincristine phenytoin proliferation migration invasion human glioma cell line aim study investigate antimigratory antiinvasive potential vincristine sulfate vcr human glioma cell analyze whether phenytoin diphenylhydantoin dph might act synergistically vcr vincristine affect cytoplasmic microtubule dph reported enhance vcr cytotoxicity murine cell two human glioma cell line gamg dmg found vcr reduce monolayer growth colony formation dosedependent fashion concentration ngml phenytoin increased cytotoxic cytostatic effect vcr monolayer cell spheroid multicellular spheroid used investigate directional migration coculture system gamg dmg spheroid fetal rat brain aggregate used analyze quantify tumor cell invasion dosedependent inhibition migration invasion vcr observed cell line without enhancement dph immunofluorescence microscopy antibody alphatubulin revealed dosedependent morphological alteration microtubule cell exposed vcr incubation dph based combination standardized vitro model system currently use present data author strongly suggest vcr inhibits migration invasion human glioma cell altered dph inhibits cell proliferation combination vcr

Confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) is a new type of microscope, which permits non-invasive optical sectioning of biomaterials by reducing out-of-focus haze. A biofilm of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was developed on the silicon disks using a modified Robbins device and used to visualize hydrated living biofilm with CLSM. In order to examine optimum staining agents and conditions, acridine orange, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), FITC-conjugated concanavalin A (FITC-ConA), Evans blue, safranine and rhodamine-conjugated concanavalin A were used in three different medium (pH 4.5, pH 7.5, pH 9.5). Only extracellular matrix was stained as a net-like structure for FITC-ConA and only bacteria for acridine orange and safranine. Although the staining patterns with FITC and Evans blue were affected markedly by the medium pH, those with other staining agents were not affected significantly. It was considered that the staining characteristics specific for each agent and changes of staining pattern by pH were probably due to relative differences among matrix, bacteria and staining agents in their electrostatic charges.

7538181,"Enhanced expression of CD34 messenger RNA by developing endothelial cells of mice. Immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that CD34 antigen is present on the surface of vascular endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells. Roles of CD34 for angiogenesis and its function as a homophilic adhesion molecule between endothelial and hematopoietic cells have been speculated. Northern blotting was used to examine the expression levels of CD34 mRNA, and in situ hybridization was used to localize CD34 mRNA. First, we investigated changes in CD34 mRNA expression in developmental processes of mice. Second, we investigated the changes in skin tissues of adult mice in the process of wound healing and tumor growth. CD34 mRNA was strongly expressed by most of the vascular endothelial cells in developing organs. The magnitude of the expression decreased after birth but increased again in the process of wound healing and tumor growth. Although CD34 mRNA signals were observed in hematopoietic cells in the yolk sac and fetal liver, the endothelial cells of these tissues did not express CD34 mRNA signals. CD34 mRNA signals were detectable in neither hematopoietic nor endothelial cells of the bone marrow. In tissues other than hematopoietic ones, however, blood cells within the vessels did not express CD34 mRNA, although the endothelial cells expressed CD34 mRNA. The expression pattern of CD34 mRNA suggested its significant role in development of blood vessels not only in embryos but also in adults. Although CD34 mRNA was expressed both by endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells, the expression did not occur within the same organ, suggesting that the CD34 molecule may not be used as a homophilic adhesion molecule between endothelial and hematopoietic cells.",Immunology,enhanced expression cd messenger rna developing endothelial cell mouse immunohistochemical study demonstrated cd antigen present surface vascular endothelial cell hematopoietic cell role cd angiogenesis function homophilic adhesion molecule endothelial hematopoietic cell speculated northern blotting used examine expression level cd mrna situ hybridization used localize cd mrna first investigated change cd mrna expression developmental process mouse second investigated change skin tissue adult mouse process wound healing tumor growth cd mrna strongly expressed vascular endothelial cell developing organ magnitude expression decreased birth increased process wound healing tumor growth although cd mrna signal observed hematopoietic cell yolk sac fetal liver endothelial cell tissue express cd mrna signal cd mrna signal detectable neither hematopoietic endothelial cell bone marrow tissue hematopoietic one however blood cell within vessel express cd mrna although endothelial cell expressed cd mrna expression pattern cd mrna suggested significant role development blood vessel embryo also adult although cd mrna expressed endothelial cell hematopoietic cell expression occur within organ suggesting cd molecule may used homophilic adhesion molecule endothelial hematopoietic cell
7538174,"Identification of regions in polyomavirus middle T and small t antigens important for association with protein phosphatase 2A. Two subunits of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) have been shown previously to bind to the small t and middle T antigens (ST and MT, respectively) of polyomavirus. To determine sequences important for binding of PP2A to ST and MT, we first constructed a series of ST mutants in regions known to be important for biological activity of ST and MT. Several mutations in two small regions just amino terminal to the Cys-X-Cys-X-X-Cys motifs of ST and MT abolished PP2A binding to ST in vitro. Parallel mutations were constructed in MT to investigate the role of PP2A binding in the function of polyomavirus MT. Wild-type and mutant MT proteins were stably expressed in NIH 3T3 cells and analyzed (i) for their ability to induce transformation and (ii) for associated cellular proteins and corresponding enzymatic activities previously described as associating with wild-type MT. A number of the mutant MTs were found to be defective in binding of PP2A as assayed by coimmunoprecipitation. In contrast, a deletion of the highly conserved stretch of amino acids 42 to 47 (His-Pro-Asp-Lys-Gly-Gly) in the ST-MT-large T antigen common region did not affect PP2A binding to MT. MT mutants defective for PP2A binding were also defective in transformation, providing further evidence that association with PP2A is important for the ability of MT to transform cells. All mutants which were impaired for PP2A binding were similarly or more dramatically impaired for associated protein and lipid kinase activities, supporting the possibility that PP2A binding is necessary for the formation and/or stability of an MT-pp60c-src complex.",Immunology,identification region polyomavirus middle small antigen important association protein phosphatase two subunit protein phosphatase ppa shown previously bind small middle antigen st mt respectively polyomavirus determine sequence important binding ppa st mt first constructed series st mutant region known important biological activity st mt several mutation two small region amino terminal cysxcysxxcys motif st mt abolished ppa binding st vitro parallel mutation constructed mt investigate role ppa binding function polyomavirus mt wildtype mutant mt protein stably expressed nih cell analyzed ability induce transformation ii associated cellular protein corresponding enzymatic activity previously described associating wildtype mt number mutant mt found defective binding ppa assayed coimmunoprecipitation contrast deletion highly conserved stretch amino acid hisproasplysglygly stmtlarge antigen common region affect ppa binding mt mt mutant defective ppa binding also defective transformation providing evidence association ppa important ability mt transform cell mutant impaired ppa binding similarly dramatically impaired associated protein lipid kinase activity supporting possibility ppa binding necessary formation andor stability mtppcsrc complex

7537489,"Use of aprotinin in LVAD recipients reduces blood loss, blood use, and perioperative mortality. Aprotinin, a bovine protease inhibitor, has been used extensively in patients undergoing cardiac surgical procedures in an effort to minimize blood loss and prevent the complications associated with blood replacement. We sought to evaluate the effect of aprotinin on postoperative blood loss, renal function, and the incidence of right ventricular failure in patients undergoing placement of a TCI Heartmate left ventricular assist device as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. Retrospective data analysis in 142 patients (42 receiving aprotinin and 100 untreated) demonstrated that the use of aprotinin was associated with a significant decrease in postoperative blood loss (p = 0.019) and in the intraoperative packed red blood cell transfusion (p = 0.019) and total blood product (p = 0.016) requirements. A transient, yet significant, increase in the postoperative creatinine level in the aprotinin group (p = 0.0006), but not in blood urea nitrogen level (p = 0.22), was noted. Interestingly, we noted an association between blood loss and the subsequent development of right ventricular failure; patients who required a right ventricular assist device bled significantly more than did those who did not suffer right ventricular failure (p = 0.02). Additionally, aprotinin recipients benefited by a reduction of nearly one half in the incidence of the need for a right ventricular assist device. The incidence of perioperative mortality was reduced in those receiving aprotinin compared with that in untreated patients, (p = 0.05). We conclude that aprotinin is safe and effective in decreasing postoperative blood loss and intraoperative blood product requirements, and in reducing perioperative mortality in patients undergoing left ventricular assist device placement as a bridge to cardiac transplantation.",Immunology,use aprotinin lvad recipient reduces blood loss blood use perioperative mortality aprotinin bovine protease inhibitor used extensively patient undergoing cardiac surgical procedure effort minimize blood loss prevent complication associated blood replacement sought evaluate effect aprotinin postoperative blood loss renal function incidence right ventricular failure patient undergoing placement tci heartmate left ventricular assist device bridge cardiac transplantation retrospective data analysis patient receiving aprotinin untreated demonstrated use aprotinin associated significant decrease postoperative blood loss intraoperative packed red blood cell transfusion total blood product requirement transient yet significant increase postoperative creatinine level aprotinin group blood urea nitrogen level noted interestingly noted association blood loss subsequent development right ventricular failure patient required right ventricular assist device bled significantly suffer right ventricular failure additionally aprotinin recipient benefited reduction nearly one half incidence need right ventricular assist device incidence perioperative mortality reduced receiving aprotinin compared untreated patient conclude aprotinin safe effective decreasing postoperative blood loss intraoperative blood product requirement reducing perioperative mortality patient undergoing left ventricular assist device placement bridge cardiac transplantation
7537351,"The effect of fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, and pericytes on sprout formation of endothelial cells in a fibrin gel angiogenesis system. We have recently shown that during angiogenesis in situ, sprouting and newly formed capillaries appear to be composed of two cell types, endothelial cells and nonendothelial, pericyte-like cells. The effect of pericytes on the process of neovessel formation is largely unknown. To study the influence of nonendothelial cell types on endothelial tubule formation, we have performed coculture experiments in a fibrin-clot angiogenesis system. When seeded below a critical density on the surface of fibrin gels, endothelial cells (from macro- or microvascular origin) did not show spontaneous formation of sprouts. However, in superconfluent cell cultures or after stimulation of endothelial cells with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), endothelial cells frequently acquired an elongated shape. By stimulation of endothelial cells with both bFGF and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), development of short capillary-like structures was induced. When endothelial cells were cocultivated with a cell type of high fibrinolytic potential, i.e., fibroblasts, development of capillary-like formations could not be detected. Cocultivation of endothelial cells with vascular smooth muscle cells or with retinal pericytes also did not increase the number of capillary-like formations in fibrin gels. In contrast, vascular smooth muscle cells on their own could be demonstrated to give rise to branched capillary-like networks in fibrin, which easily could be mistaken for true capillaries. Our results indicate that periendothelial cells contribute to angiogenesis not only by fibrinolysis and proteolytic permeation of the extracellular matrix. Rather, the interactions of endothelial cells and pericyte-like cells, as frequently observed during neovessel formation in situ, appear to be more specific and may require factors hitherto unknown.",Immunology,effect fibroblast vascular smooth muscle cell pericytes sprout formation endothelial cell fibrin gel angiogenesis system recently shown angiogenesis situ sprouting newly formed capillary appear composed two cell type endothelial cell nonendothelial pericytelike cell effect pericytes process neovessel formation largely unknown study influence nonendothelial cell type endothelial tubule formation performed coculture experiment fibrinclot angiogenesis system seeded critical density surface fibrin gel endothelial cell macro microvascular origin show spontaneous formation sprout however superconfluent cell culture stimulation endothelial cell basic fibroblast growth factor bfgf endothelial cell frequently acquired elongated shape stimulation endothelial cell bfgf vascular endothelial growth factor vegf development short capillarylike structure induced endothelial cell cocultivated cell type high fibrinolytic potential ie fibroblast development capillarylike formation detected cocultivation endothelial cell vascular smooth muscle cell retinal pericytes also increase number capillarylike formation fibrin gel contrast vascular smooth muscle cell demonstrated give rise branched capillarylike network fibrin easily mistaken true capillary result indicate periendothelial cell contribute angiogenesis fibrinolysis proteolytic permeation extracellular matrix rather interaction endothelial cell pericytelike cell frequently observed neovessel formation situ appear specific may require factor hitherto unknown

7537305,"Development of antimalaria immunity in mice lacking IFN-gamma receptor. IFN-gamma receptor deficient (IFN-gamma R-/-) mice, immunized with different developmental stages of malaria parasites, were used to define the mechanisms of protection against the various stages of this infection. IFN-gamma R-/- mice failed to develop protective immunity against Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites or liver stages, upon immunization with a single dose of irradiated sporozoites, whereas in immunized wild-type mice, parasite development was strongly inhibited. Immunized wild-type mice expressed high levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA in their liver, upon challenge with viable sporozoites, whereas only background levels of iNOS were detected in immunized IFN-gamma R-/- mice. In contrast, after immunization with multiple doses of irradiated sporozoites, both IFN-gamma R-/- and wild-type mice mounted an immune response, which strongly inhibited the development of liver stage parasites. In both types of mice, protection occurred in the absence of appreciable expression of liver iNOS mRNA. As for the course of the erythrocytic phase of infection by nonlethal malaria species, P. yoelii yoelii and P. chabaudi adami, we observed only a moderately prolonged parasitemia in IFN-gamma R-/- mice compared with wild-type mice, indicating that IFN-gamma may only play a modest role in immunity against erythrocytic stages. These results indicate that IFN-gamma is the main mediator of the protective mechanism that develops first upon immunization with sporozoites. However, the nature of the anti-parasite mechanism(s) changes in the course of immunization, so that multiple immunizing doses elicit additional protective mechanisms, which are independent of IFN-gamma and its receptor.",Immunology,development antimalaria immunity mouse lacking ifngamma receptor ifngamma receptor deficient ifngamma mouse immunized different developmental stage malaria parasite used define mechanism protection various stage infection ifngamma mouse failed develop protective immunity plasmodium yoelii sporozoite liver stage upon immunization single dose irradiated sporozoite whereas immunized wildtype mouse parasite development strongly inhibited immunized wildtype mouse expressed high level inducible nitric oxide synthase inos mrna liver upon challenge viable sporozoite whereas background level inos detected immunized ifngamma mouse contrast immunization multiple dos irradiated sporozoite ifngamma wildtype mouse mounted immune response strongly inhibited development liver stage parasite type mouse protection occurred absence appreciable expression liver inos mrna course erythrocytic phase infection nonlethal malaria specie yoelii yoelii chabaudi adami observed moderately prolonged parasitemia ifngamma mouse compared wildtype mouse indicating ifngamma may play modest role immunity erythrocytic stage result indicate ifngamma main mediator protective mechanism develops first upon immunization sporozoite however nature antiparasite mechanism change course immunization multiple immunizing dos elicit additional protective mechanism independent ifngamma receptor

To determine the effect of diabetes mellitus on the levels of substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in the rat cornea and iris. Corneas and irides from control and diabetic rats were processed for neuropeptide radioimmunoassay 3 months after induction of diabetes with streptozotocin. Corneas and irides also were processed for SP and CGRP immunohistochemistry and were evaluated qualitatively. The radioimmunoassay data revealed no significant differences in either the content or concentration of SP, CGRP, and VIP between control and diabetic corneas. In contrast, iridial levels of CGRP and SP were significantly increased by 38% and 256%, respectively, in the diabetic animals. Iridial VIP levels were unchanged in the diabetic versus control groups. Immunohistochemical demonstrations of corneal and iridial SP- and CGRP-immunoreactive fiber plexuses were indistinguishable on the basis of purely qualitative criteria. The results of this study have demonstrated a target- and peptide-specific effect of short-term diabetes on SP and CGRP expression in ocular nerves of the anterior eye segment. The absence of demonstrable changes in corneal neuropeptide levels argue against the theory that corneal abnormalities seen in clinical diabetes are caused, in part, by deficits in synthesis or axonal transport of ""trophic"" peptides in corneal sensory nerves.

7537214,"A major role for the protein tyrosine kinase JAK1 in the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway in response to interleukin-6. The protein tyrosine kinases JAK1, JAK2 and Tyk2 and STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) 1 and 3 are activated in response to interleukin-6 (IL-6) in human fibrosarcoma cells. In mutant cells lacking JAK1, JAK2 or Tyk2, the absence of one kinase does not prevent activation of the others; activation does not, therefore, involve a sequential three-kinase cascade. In the absence of JAK1, the phosphorylation of the gp130 subunit of the IL-6 receptor and the activation of STATs 1 and 3 are greatly reduced. JAK1 is also necessary for the induction of IRF1 mRNA, thus establishing a requirement for the JAK/STAT pathway in the IL-6 response. JAK2 and Tyk2 although activated cannot, in the absence of JAK1, efficiently mediate activation of STATs 1 and 3. A kinase-negative mutant of JAK2 can, however, inhibit such activation, and ancillary roles for JAK2 and Tyk2 are not excluded.

7537154,"Systemic antitumor effects of electrochemotherapy combined with histoincompatible cells secreting interleukin-2. Electrochemotherapy is an antitumor treatment that combines a cytotoxic drug with the local administration of electric pulses delivered at the tumor site. We previously found that in mice the cure rate of subcutaneous transplanted tumors treated by electrochemotherapy is increased by repeated systemic interleukin-2 (IL-2) injections. Moreover, histoincompatible cells engineered to secrete IL-2 allow the rejection of syngeneic tumor cells when both cells are inoculated together. In this study of preestablished tumors in mice we show that after electrochemotherapy, delayed peritumoral injections of histoincompatible IL-2-producing cells result in the cure of almost all the tumors. Moreover, this combined local treatment leads to cures of untreated, contralaterally transplanted tumors. This systemic antitumor immunity also resulted in complete protection of the cured mice against further inocula of the tumor cells. These results, which were obtained using allogeneic as well as xenogeneic IL-2-secreting cells, suggest that electrochemotherapy combined with such cellular immunotherapy might be a useful approach for the treatment of metastasizing cancers.",Immunology,systemic antitumor effect electrochemotherapy combined histoincompatible cell secreting interleukin electrochemotherapy antitumor treatment combine cytotoxic drug local administration electric pulse delivered tumor site previously found mouse cure rate subcutaneous transplanted tumor treated electrochemotherapy increased repeated systemic interleukin il injection moreover histoincompatible cell engineered secrete il allow rejection syngeneic tumor cell cell inoculated together study preestablished tumor mouse show electrochemotherapy delayed peritumoral injection histoincompatible ilproducing cell result cure almost tumor moreover combined local treatment lead cure untreated contralaterally transplanted tumor systemic antitumor immunity also resulted complete protection cured mouse inoculum tumor cell result obtained using allogeneic well xenogeneic ilsecreting cell suggest electrochemotherapy combined cellular immunotherapy might useful approach treatment metastasizing cancer

Modulation of intracellular glutathione concentration was associated with changes in cytotoxicity.

The effects of capsaicin on the sensory neuropeptides substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide were analyzed in the ankle joints and dorsal root ganglia (L2-L6) of adult female Lewis rats. The study included 23 normal rats and 23 arthritic rats, all injected subcutaneously with capsaicin (total dose 200 mg/kg bw). Another two groups of animals from a previous study, i.e., 23 normal rats and 23 arthritic rats not given capsaicin served as controls. Adjuvant arthritis was induced by inoculation with heat-killed mycobacteria. The morphological distribution of sensory neuropeptides was assessed by immunohistochemistry and the tissue concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. In normal rats, capsaicin significantly reduced the concentrations of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide in ankle joints (54 and 36%, respectively) as well as dorsal root ganglia (40 and 54%, respectively). In arthritic rats those pretreated with capsaicin had significantly lower concentrations of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide in dorsal root ganglia (19 and 42%, respectively) compared to the arthritic controls. In the ankle joints, however, only the SP concentration was reduced (42%). Notably, this was accompanied by a 40% reduction in inflammatory response as assessed by comparing the ankle joint weights of the experimental groups. In general, there was a good correlation between the neuropeptide concentrations in ipsilateral ankle joints and the corresponding dorsal root ganglia as assessed in individual rats. The present study of adjuvant induced arthritis shows that capsaicin administration reduces the otherwise up-regulated levels of sensory neuropeptides in dorsal root ganglia and ankle joints. However, capsaicin at the dose given can only mitigate, not completely prevent the development of joint inflammation. Nonetheless, the findings suggest that antineuronal therapy targeted against specific neurotransmitters may prove useful in inflammatory joint disease.",Immunology,capsaicin effect substance cgrp rat adjuvant arthritis effect capsaicin sensory neuropeptides substance calcitonin generelated peptide analyzed ankle joint dorsal root ganglion adult female lewis rat study included normal rat arthritic rat injected subcutaneously capsaicin total dose mgkg bw another two group animal previous study ie normal rat arthritic rat given capsaicin served control adjuvant arthritis induced inoculation heatkilled mycobacteria morphological distribution sensory neuropeptides assessed immunohistochemistry tissue concentration determined radioimmunoassay normal rat capsaicin significantly reduced concentration substance calcitonin generelated peptide ankle joint respectively well dorsal root ganglion respectively arthritic rat pretreated capsaicin significantly lower concentration substance calcitonin generelated peptide dorsal root ganglion respectively compared arthritic control ankle joint however sp concentration reduced notably accompanied reduction inflammatory response assessed comparing ankle joint weight experimental group general good correlation neuropeptide concentration ipsilateral ankle joint corresponding dorsal root ganglion assessed individual rat present study adjuvant induced arthritis show capsaicin administration reduces otherwise upregulated level sensory neuropeptides dorsal root ganglion ankle joint however capsaicin dose given mitigate completely prevent development joint inflammation nonetheless finding suggest antineuronal therapy targeted specific neurotransmitter may prove useful inflammatory joint disease

Medical Research Council Lung Cancer Working Party. This study was conducted to test the feasibility of reducing the interval between cycles of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide (ACE) chemotherapy to 2 weeks, thereby increasing dose intensity, by adding granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to reduce the duration of neutropenia following a cycle. 20 patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) were prescribed six cycles of 2-weekly ACE, with G-CSF on the intermediate days. 3 patients died during the treatment period and a further 5 had ACE terminated, 3 for toxicity and 2 for progressive disease. Of the 71 intervals between cycles, 42 (59%) were of the prescribed 14 days, 9 (13%) of 15-20 days, 15 (21%) of 21 days and five (7%) longer, but during the first four cycles, 36 (77%) of 47 intervals were of 14 days.

7535718,"A novel role for a U5 snRNP protein in 3' splice site selection. The choice of a 3' splice site in Saccharomyces cerevisiae introns involves recognition of a uridine-rich tract upstream of the AG dinucleotide splice junction. By isolating mutants that eliminate the normal preference for uridine-containing 3' splice sites in a cis-competition, we identified a mutation that is an allele of PRP8, prp8-101. This was unexpected because previous analysis has demonstrated that the U5 snRNP protein encoded by PRP8 is required for spliceosome assembly prior to the first catalytic step of splicing. In contrast, the uridine recognition defect caused by the prp8-101 mutation selectively inhibits the second catalytic step of splicing. This defect is seen not only in 3' splice site cis-competitions but also in the splicing of an unusual intron in the TUB3 gene and in the ACT1 intron when utilization of its 3' splice site is rate limiting for splicing. Consistent with a direct role in 3' splice site selection, Prp8 can be cross-linked to the 3' splice site during the splicing reaction. These data demonstrate a novel function for Prp8 in 3' splice site recognition and utilization.",Immunology,novel role snrnp protein splice site selection choice splice site saccharomyces cerevisiae intron involves recognition uridinerich tract upstream ag dinucleotide splice junction isolating mutant eliminate normal preference uridinecontaining splice site ciscompetition identified mutation allele prp prp unexpected previous analysis demonstrated snrnp protein encoded prp required spliceosome assembly prior first catalytic step splicing contrast uridine recognition defect caused prp mutation selectively inhibits second catalytic step splicing defect seen splice site ciscompetitions also splicing unusual intron tub gene act intron utilization splice site rate limiting splicing consistent direct role splice site selection prp crosslinked splice site splicing reaction data demonstrate novel function prp splice site recognition utilization

7533503,"Enhancer sharing in a plasmid model containing the alpha-fetoprotein and albumin promoters. It has been proposed that the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) enhancers also regulate the adjacent albumin gene, since the -10 kbp albumin enhancer is inactive in a number of cell lines that express albumin. In transfection experiments, the AFP enhancers strongly stimulate the albumin promoter in cells that silence the AFP promoter. These observations led us to develop a plasmid model of AFP-albumin gene switching, in which the albumin and AFP promoters would compete for the three AFP enhancers. However, when AFPCAT + ALBgal genes were combined with the AFP enhancers in one plasmid, both genes were driven at full activity. There was no change in the relative promoter expression over a wide range of transfected DNA concentrations, demonstrating that relative promoter activity was independent of DNA concentration and of promoter concentration, and that neither promoter was limiting the expression of the other. In contrast, a control plasmid containing two albumin promoters showed mutual inhibition, indicating the expected promoter competition. The albumin and AFP promoters noncompetitively shared the three enhancers on this plasmid, resulting in high levels of transcription from both promoters.",Immunology,enhancer sharing plasmid model containing alphafetoprotein albumin promoter proposed alphafetoprotein afp enhancer also regulate adjacent albumin gene since kbp albumin enhancer inactive number cell line express albumin transfection experiment afp enhancer strongly stimulate albumin promoter cell silence afp promoter observation led u develop plasmid model afpalbumin gene switching albumin afp promoter compete three afp enhancer however afpcat albgal gene combined afp enhancer one plasmid gene driven full activity change relative promoter expression wide range transfected dna concentration demonstrating relative promoter activity independent dna concentration promoter concentration neither promoter limiting expression contrast control plasmid containing two albumin promoter showed mutual inhibition indicating expected promoter competition albumin afp promoter noncompetitively shared three enhancer plasmid resulting high level transcription promoter

Significant correlations were found between scores obtained on the play test and both language measures. Exploratory statistics indicated that, when age was taken into account, partial correlations between play and language remained moderate. Further analysis of the results also suggested that the relationship between play and language ability as measured by the tests was stronger for the younger children in the sample than for the older children.

Interleukin 3 (IL-3) induces proliferation and differentiation of mast cell progenitors in vitro, whereas it induces granulocytosis in vivo. In this paper, a positive feedback mechanism of granulopoiesis was studied in order to elucidate the granulocytosis induced by IL-3 in mouse. IL-3 induced expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in total bone marrow cells and a marrow adherent cell population. In fractionated marrow cell populations, a different expression pattern of induction of IL-3 stimulation was observed; GM-CSF was expressed in macrophages and fraction 1 (P < 1.061) and 2(1.061 < P 1.074) of bone marrow cells fractionated by equilibrium density centrifugation, G-CSF was expressed in macrophages and fraction 2 and 3 (1.074 < P < 1.097), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in macrophages and fraction 1 to 3. These results indicate a hierarchical regulation of cytokine production and the existence of a positive feedback mechanism in granulopoiesis.

7529010,"Distribution of transposable elements in arthropods. Transposable elements of the DNA-mediated and RNA-mediated classes found in arthropods are briefly described and their distribution reviewed. The distribution patterns of DNA-mediated elements are extremely patchy and the principal cause appears to be the horizontal transfer of elements between host lineages. In the best documented case of mariner elements, these hosts can be in different orders of insects, classes of arthropods, and even other phyla of animals. RNA-mediated elements appear to undergo much longer periods of vertical evolution within host lineages, and evidence for their horizontal transfer remains scant. The evolutionary relationships of many of these transposons have recently been illuminated by phylogenetic analyses of the reverse-transcriptase enzymes of the RNA-mediated elements, and the recognition that the transposases of some of the DNA-mediated elements are distantly related to in the integrases of some of the RNA-mediated elements.",Immunology,distribution transposable element arthropod transposable element dnamediated rnamediated class found arthropod briefly described distribution reviewed distribution pattern dnamediated element extremely patchy principal cause appears horizontal transfer element host lineage best documented case mariner element host different order insect class arthropod even phylum animal rnamediated element appear undergo much longer period vertical evolution within host lineage evidence horizontal transfer remains scant evolutionary relationship many transposon recently illuminated phylogenetic analysis reversetranscriptase enzyme rnamediated element recognition transposases dnamediated element distantly related integrases rnamediated element
7528139,"The widespread expression of angiogenin in different human cells suggests a biological function not only related to angiogenesis. Angiogenin is a secreted polypeptide that induces neovascularization in vivo. The expression of angiogenin by human cells in culture was investigated by using a specific radioimmunoassay and by cDNA hybridization. Angiogenin immunoreactivity was widely but differentially produced by anchorage-dependent growing cells including vascular endothelial cells from saphenous and umbilical veins, aortic smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts (from embryos, new-borns and adults), and tumour cells. Endothelial cells from saphenous veins and the endothelium-derived EA.hy926 cell line released immunoreactivity whatever the stage of the culture, including release at the lag phase, during exponential growth and at the confluent phase. However, the rate of accumulation of angiogenin varied as a function of EA.hy926 cell density. As compared to anchored cells, normal peripheral blood cells and tumour cells of myelomonocytic and megakaryocytic origin did not noticeably secrete angiogenin except at low levels. A myeloma cell line supernatant contained as much angiogenin cross-reactivity as did anchored cells, while four tumour T-cell lines expressed the cross-reactivity at different levels, i.e. from undetectable levels to a high level. A 0.9-kb angiogenin messenger RNA was detected by Northern-blot analyses in a variety of representative cells correlating with the presence of immunoreactivity in the cell-culture media.

7526919,"P56lck: a transducing protein that binds to SH2 containing proteins and to phosphotyrosine containing proteins. In T lymphocytes, several proteins are rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine after stimulation. In this study we examine the ability of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins from Jurkat T cells stimulated by CD2 or T cell receptor (TcR)-CD3 to interact with the src homology 2 (SH2) domains from p56lck (Lck). Our data show that the patterns are different depending on the stimulation. The specificity of the interactions was assessed by blocking experiments with high affinity phosphotyrosine [Y(P)] peptides. Phosphorylation experiments suggest that one or several kinases are able to interact with the SH2 from Lck. On the other hand, full length Lck overexpressed in Sf9 cells, which is tyrosine-phosphorylated at least on two sites, can interact in vitro with the SH2 from Lck, phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma 1, p85 (the regulatory subunit of phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase (PI3K)) and Nck and with the full length Grb2.

7524372,"Organization of vestibular inputs to nucleus tractus solitarius and adjacent structures in cat brain stem. The vestibular system is involved in maintaining stable blood pressure and respiration during changes in posture and is essential for eliciting motion sickness-related vomiting. Because the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) participates in the regulation of sympathetic and inspiratory outflow and the triggering of emesis, we tested the hypothesis that this region receives vestibular inputs in cats. In one set of experiments, microinjections of the tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin into the medial and inferior vestibular nuclei labeled projections to the middle and lateral regions of the NTS. In electrophysiological experiments, electrical stimulation of the vestibular nerve modified the firing rates of neurons located in the same regions. Some neurons with vestibular inputs received convergent signals from the abdominal vagus nerve and could potentially mediate motion sickness-related vomiting. Others received convergent baroreceptor inputs and could act as a substrate for some components of vestibulosympathetic reflexes. In contrast, inspiratory neurons in the dorsal respiratory group received little vestibular input, suggesting that vestibulorespiratory reflexes are mediated by cells located elsewhere.",Immunology,organization vestibular input nucleus tractus solitarius adjacent structure cat brain stem vestibular system involved maintaining stable blood pressure respiration change posture essential eliciting motion sicknessrelated vomiting nucleus tractus solitarius nt participates regulation sympathetic inspiratory outflow triggering emesis tested hypothesis region receives vestibular input cat one set experiment microinjections tracer phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin medial inferior vestibular nucleus labeled projection middle lateral region nt electrophysiological experiment electrical stimulation vestibular nerve modified firing rate neuron located region neuron vestibular input received convergent signal abdominal vagus nerve potentially mediate motion sicknessrelated vomiting others received convergent baroreceptor input act substrate component vestibulosympathetic reflex contrast inspiratory neuron dorsal respiratory group received little vestibular input suggesting vestibulorespiratory reflex mediated cell located elsewhere
7524347,"Regulation of pancreatic amylase and lipase gene expression by diet and insulin in diabetic rats. Although insulin has been proposed to mediate the dietary regulation of pancreatic amylase, its interaction with diet in the regulation of amylase and lipase is not well understood and was examined in diabetic rats fed diets high in carbohydrate (HC), protein (HP), or fat (HF) and treated with insulin. Diabetes, independent of diet, decreased amylase content (97%; P < 0.0001) and mRNA (90%; P < 0.0001), but insulin only restored amylase content and mRNA to respective dietary control values. Diabetes, independent of diet, also increased lipase mRNA 1.6-fold (P < 0.004) but interacted (P < 0.0003) with diet on lipase content, resulting in opposite effects in HC- (increased 202%) and HF-diabetic rats (decreased 40%). Insulin partially restored lipase content and mRNA to respective dietary control values. Diet, independent of diabetes, regulated amylase content (P < 0.0001) and mRNA (P < 0.0003), which were three- to fourfold greater in HC- than in HF-fed rats, and lipase content (P < 0.001) and mRNA [rat pancreatic lipase 1 (rPL-1), P < 0.04; rPL-3, P < 0.0001], which were 1.8-fold greater in HF- than in HC- or HP-fed rats. Insulin failed to stimulate maximal amylase gene expression in HP- or HF-fed diabetic rats, suggesting that it is necessary, but not sufficient, for this dietary regulation.

Three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance (MR) angiography using radiofrequency presaturation pulses was used to evaluate the patency of extracranial-intracranial (EC/IC) bypass in 11 patients. Presaturation causes signal loss in the vascular territory supplied by the presaturated EC/IC bypass graft. In all patients with a patent EC/IC bypass graft confirmed on conventional angiography, disappearance of the signal of the middle cerebral artery receiving blood flow from the bypass graft was clearly observed on MR angiograms with presaturation, indicating patency of the EC/IC bypass graft.

7521734,"The transmembrane region of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor: is it an all-helix bundle?. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is the best characterised member of the Ligand-Gated-Ion-Channel family of receptors. In spite of a wealth of data from molecular cloning studies these receptors have so far eluded all attempts at crystallisation; quantitative structural data are few and are at relatively low resolution. The widely accepted current model for the topology of the receptors is that of a pentameric cylindrical bundle that spans the membrane. The disposition of the transmembrane region of the individual subunits is based on hydropathy profiles calculated from sequence data which are interpreted as indicating a common structural motif of four antiparallel alpha-helices, M1 to M4. Until very recently this model has been unquestioned even though there are few direct experimental data to support it. We have constructed models of this key functional region for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, building out from the ion-channel. The model of the basic ion-channel comprises a five helical M2 bundle with a left-handed twist. The remainder of the region (M1, M3, M4) was homology modelled, together with M2, as a four helix antiparallel bundle per subunit, using the crystal structure of myohaemerythrin as a template. The models strongly suggest that the four helix bundle model is inappropriate and that recent suggestions of a mixed motif of helix and sheet may better accommodate the existing data.",Immunology,transmembrane region nicotinic acetylcholine receptor allhelix bundle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor best characterised member ligandgatedionchannel family receptor spite wealth data molecular cloning study receptor far eluded attempt crystallisation quantitative structural data relatively low resolution widely accepted current model topology receptor pentameric cylindrical bundle span membrane disposition transmembrane region individual subunit based hydropathy profile calculated sequence data interpreted indicating common structural motif four antiparallel alphahelices recently model unquestioned even though direct experimental data support constructed model key functional region nicotinic acetylcholine receptor building ionchannel model basic ionchannel comprises five helical bundle lefthanded twist remainder region homology modelled together four helix antiparallel bundle per subunit using crystal structure myohaemerythrin template model strongly suggest four helix bundle model inappropriate recent suggestion mixed motif helix sheet may better accommodate existing data
7521688,"Rapid activation of the STAT3 transcription factor by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a glycoprotein that stimulates proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells of neutrophils by signaling through its receptor (G-CSFR). Although the G-CSFR belongs to the cytokine receptor superfamily, which lacks an intracellular kinase domain, G-CSF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins is critical for its biologic activities. We report here that JAK1 and JAK2 tyrosine kinases are tyrosine phosphorylated in response to G-CSF induction. We also demonstrate that the DNA-binding protein STAT3 (also called the acute-phase response factor [APRF], activated by interleukin-6) is an early target of G-CSF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. G-CSF induces two DNA-binding complexes; the major complex contains tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 protein and the minor complex appears to be a heterodimer of the STAT1 (previously p91, a component of DNA-binding complexes activated by interferons) and STAT3 proteins. Antiphosphotyrosine antibody interferes with the DNA binding activity of activated STAT3, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 is important for the DNA binding activity. These results identify a signal transduction pathway activated in response to G-CSF and provide a mechanism for the rapid modulation of gene expression by G-CSF.",Immunology,rapid activation stat transcription factor granulocyte colonystimulating factor granulocyte colonystimulating factor gcsf glycoprotein stimulates proliferation differentiation progenitor cell neutrophil signaling receptor gcsfr although gcsfr belongs cytokine receptor superfamily lack intracellular kinase domain gcsfinduced tyrosine phosphorylation cellular protein critical biologic activity report jak jak tyrosine kinase tyrosine phosphorylated response gcsf induction also demonstrate dnabinding protein stat also called acutephase response factor aprf activated interleukin early target gcsfinduced tyrosine phosphorylation gcsf induces two dnabinding complex major complex contains tyrosine phosphorylated stat protein minor complex appears heterodimer stat previously component dnabinding complex activated interferon stat protein antiphosphotyrosine antibody interferes dna binding activity activated stat indicating tyrosine phosphorylation stat important dna binding activity result identify signal transduction pathway activated response gcsf provide mechanism rapid modulation gene expression gcsf

The sensitivity of Escherichia coli strains to 80% normal human serum (NHS) and the relative importance of the classical and alternative complement pathways was assessed in relation to K1, K5, and O antigen carriage. Strains of each of the common O-serogroups, O1, O2, O4, O6, O7, O9, O18 and O75, smooth strains not typable (NT) with these antisera and auto-agglutinable (AA) strains were studied. Of the 166 strains studied, 37 carried the K1 antigen and 45 the K5 antigen. The variation in sensitivity to NHS between different O-serogroups reported previously was confirmed. Although carriage of the K1 and K5 antigens varied with O-serogroup, this did not explain the differences either between or within O-serogroups. Strains with the K1 or K5 antigen were significantly more resistant to the alternative complement pathway than strains without these antigens. However, this appeared to be more related to the O-serogroups with which they were associated; 37 of 50 O2, O4, O6 and AA strains were affected by complement through both pathways but 20 of 30 O7, O18 and O75 strains were affected by the classical pathway alone and 16 of 20 O9 and NT strains were affected by the alternative pathway alone.",Immunology,antigen escherichia coli relation serum killing via classical alternative complement pathway sensitivity escherichia coli strain normal human serum nh relative importance classical alternative complement pathway assessed relation antigen carriage strain common oserogroups smooth strain typable nt antiserum autoagglutinable aa strain studied strain studied carried antigen antigen variation sensitivity nh different oserogroups reported previously confirmed although carriage antigen varied oserogroup explain difference either within oserogroups strain antigen significantly resistant alternative complement pathway strain without antigen however appeared related oserogroups associated aa strain affected complement pathway strain affected classical pathway alone nt strain affected alternative pathway alone

We studied the effects of clindamycin and a combination of clindamycin and pyrimethamine on the proliferation of Toxoplasma gondii in cultured mammalian cells and the effect of clindamycin on the parasite's RNA and protein syntheses. Infected macrophages were treated for 48 h with clindamycin or a combination of clindamycin and pyrimethamine, and the 50% inhibitory concentrations for parasite growth were 32.50 +/- 1.30 and 10.78 +/- 0.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. A modified susceptibility assay was also used to measure the effect of low concentrations of clindamycin on T. gondii. Macrophages and bovine turbinate cells were infected with low numbers of tachyzoites and were exposed to low concentrations of clindamycin for 5 days. In these systems, a concentration of 10 ng of clindamycin per ml inhibited 50% of the growth of the parasite in macrophages, while it completely prohibited the growth of the parasite in epithelial cells. When free tachyzoites were preexposed to clindamycin for 4 h, the reduction of parasite infectivity was proportional to the amount of drug; 100 ng of clindamycin per ml reduced the infectivity of T. gondii to 46.5% +/- 8.5% of that of the untreated control. A concentration of 40 micrograms of clindamycin per ml reduced protein synthesis by 56.2% +/- 6.0% but had no effect on RNA synthesis after a 4-h exposure of free tachyzoites of T. gondii to the drug.

Here we present evidence that distinct 'Ia-like' antigens are found on different haematopoietic cells. Approximately half of the Ia-like molecules expressed by B cells and activated T cells have an 'epitope' which is unique to lymphocytes and is not detectable on the Ia-like molecules of haematopoietic precursors or monocytes.

Because results of retropubic I-125 implantation for prostate cancer have been poor, external beam radiation was added postimplant. Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) was used to assess this approach of combined irradiation. Two hundred and thirty-nine patients with clinical Stage T1 or T2 but surgically node-negative prostate cancer were treated. Results were monitored by serial serum PSA evaluation. Positive clinical findings or a rising PSA level defined recurrent disease. With a median follow-up of 45 months (range, 24-120 months), the Kaplan-Meier projected disease free survival rate was 74% at 5 years and 66% at 10 years. Overall at a 60-month minimum follow-up, 77% of patients had a PSA of 0.5 ng/ml or less. This nadir level is highly predictive of a long term disease free survival, significantly better than pretreatment PSA, grade, or clinical Stage T1 or T2. The PSA-monitored disease free survival rate after combination irradiation appears comparable with that after radical prostatectomy and perhaps superior to that after external-beam radiation. This effect was achieved even though lower-than-usual doses of radiation from both sources were administered. The combination of an I-125 implant followed by external-beam radiation produces high doses within the prostate and, to a lesser extent, in the periprostatic tissue.

7534827,"Physiology of single putative cochlear efferents in the chicken. 1. An experimental approach was developed that allowed recording of neurophysiological activity from single putative cochlear efferents in the auditory brain stem of anesthetized chickens with the use of glass micropipettes. The aim of this study was to study spontaneous and tone-evoked activity from single efferent neurons in the chick and to compare their properties with those of other vertebrate hair cell organs. Because the birds, like mammals, have a complex hearing organ with different hair cell types and different afferent and efferent innervation, the purpose of this study was also to determine whether different types of efferents exist. 2. In the same electrode penetrations, putative trapezoid fibers were also isolated. In addition, the penetration angle permitted recordings from units in both cochlear nuclei, nucleus magnocellularis and nucleus angularis (probably mostly cochlear afferents), in the same animal. This allowed monitoring of the auditory sensitivity of the individual animal during the experiment. With the use of physiological criteria, it was possible to distinguish between trapezoid fibers and putative cochlear efferents. Possible alternative origins of the responses described are discussed. 3. Tuning curve characteristics of putative efferents were determined. They were as sensitive as ascending auditory neurons. Q10 dB values of efferent tuning curves were < 2.5 and thus showed poorer frequency selectivity than ascending fibers; in some cases they covered the entire hearing range of the chicken. 4. Latencies to tone pips were different for ascending neurons and putative efferent units. For trapezoid fibers and neurons from the cochlear nuclei, latencies usually did not exceed 5 ms, whereas latencies of efferents were always longer. 5. Because of the interaural canal that connects both middle ear cavities in birds, the measurement of the lateralization of the efferents was difficult. In any case, the majority of putative cochlear efferents responded more sensitively to sound stimulation of the contralateral side. 6. Of the efferent units, 28% showed no spontaneous activity.

In general, mean spontaneous activity was lower than in ascending fibers, being < 30 spikes/s. 7. In contrast to reports from mammalian studies, in which efferents only showed on peristimulus time (PST) response pattern to tonal stimuli (chopper), two different response types were found in this study: two excitation types (chopper and primary-like) and one suppression type.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Immunology,physiology single putative cochlear efferent chicken experimental approach developed allowed recording neurophysiological activity single putative cochlear efferent auditory brain stem anesthetized chicken use glass micropipettes aim study study spontaneous toneevoked activity single efferent neuron chick compare property vertebrate hair cell organ bird like mammal complex hearing organ different hair cell type different afferent efferent innervation purpose study also determine whether different type efferent exist electrode penetration putative trapezoid fiber also isolated addition penetration angle permitted recording unit cochlear nucleus nucleus magnocellularis nucleus angularis probably mostly cochlear afferent animal allowed monitoring auditory sensitivity individual animal experiment use physiological criterion possible distinguish trapezoid fiber putative cochlear efferent possible alternative origin response described discussed tuning curve characteristic putative efferent determined sensitive ascending auditory neuron db value efferent tuning curve thus showed poorer frequency selectivity ascending fiber case covered entire hearing range chicken latency tone pip different ascending neuron putative efferent unit trapezoid fiber neuron cochlear nucleus latency usually exceed m whereas latency efferent always longer interaural canal connects middle ear cavity bird measurement lateralization efferent difficult case majority putative cochlear efferent responded sensitively sound stimulation contralateral side efferent unit showed spontaneous activity others either showed regular spontaneous activity timeinterval histogram showed longer mode ascending fiber general mean spontaneous activity lower ascending fiber spike contrast report mammalian study efferent showed peristimulus time pst response pattern tonal stimulus chopper two different response type found study two excitation type chopper primarylike one suppression typeabstract truncated word
7534791,"Unique cytokine production profile of anergic human T cells in SCID-hu mice after staphylococcal enterotoxin B administration. Severe combined immunodeficient mice transplanted with human organs (SCID-hu mice), provide a unique in vivo model for studying human intrathymic T cell selection and development of tolerance. In vivo administration of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) to SCID-hu mice causes intrathymic clonal deletion of SEB-specific V beta+ T cells that occurs already at the immature CD4+8+ double positive stage. The expression of activation markers such as CD25, CD71, and HLA-DR was specifically increased on V beta+ T cells responding to SEB. The remaining SEB-specific human T cells that had not been deleted in vivo failed to proliferate when rechallenged with SEB in vitro. These SEB-specific T cells that were rendered anergic in vivo had a unique cytokine production profile. They failed to produce IL-2, which correlated with the lack of proliferation of these cells. In addition, they failed to produce TNF-alpha. However, the anergized T cells synthesized considerable amounts of IFN-gamma, granulocyte-macrophage CSF and IL-10 after SEB stimulation. This clonal anergy can be completely reversed in vitro by stimulating the SEB-specific cells in the presence of exogenous IL-2 or by triggering of the CD28/CTLA-4 activation pathway. Under these stimulation conditions, anergic T cells produced levels of IL-2 and TNF-alpha that were comparable to their non-anergized counterparts, whereas the levels of granulocyte-macrophage CSF, IL-10 and IFN-gamma production were even higher. Collectively, these data demonstrate that in vivo administration of SEB to SCID-hu mice leads to activation, deletion, and anergy of SEB-specific human thymocytes and that the production of IL-2 and TNF-alpha is selectively switched off in these anergic T cells.",Immunology,unique cytokine production profile anergic human cell scidhu mouse staphylococcal enterotoxin administration severe combined immunodeficient mouse transplanted human organ scidhu mouse provide unique vivo model studying human intrathymic cell selection development tolerance vivo administration staphylococcal enterotoxin seb scidhu mouse cause intrathymic clonal deletion sebspecific beta cell occurs already immature cd double positive stage expression activation marker cd cd hladr specifically increased beta cell responding seb remaining sebspecific human cell deleted vivo failed proliferate rechallenged seb vitro sebspecific cell rendered anergic vivo unique cytokine production profile failed produce il correlated lack proliferation cell addition failed produce tnfalpha however anergized cell synthesized considerable amount ifngamma granulocytemacrophage csf il seb stimulation clonal anergy completely reversed vitro stimulating sebspecific cell presence exogenous il triggering cdctla activation pathway stimulation condition anergic cell produced level il tnfalpha comparable nonanergized counterpart whereas level granulocytemacrophage csf il ifngamma production even higher collectively data demonstrate vivo administration seb scidhu mouse lead activation deletion anergy sebspecific human thymocytes production il tnfalpha selectively switched anergic cell
7534785,"Immunostaining of chain-specific keratins on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues: a comparison of various antigen retrieval systems using microwave heating and proteolytic pre-treatments. The use of chain-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against keratins in pathology is hampered by their limited staining on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. In the present study, various treatments before immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections were compared, including proteolytic enzymes and microwave antigen retrieval in various solutions. Sections of normal cervical and skin tissue were stained in a three-step immunoperoxidase method, employing a broad panel of MAbs against chain-specific keratins 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 and pankeratin. Using microwave heating, Target Unmasking Fluid (TUF), Antigen Retrieval Solution (ARS), a simple detergent solution (DET), PBS, and distilled water (MiQ) were compared. Microwave heating in PBS or MiQ strongly improved staining results. Moreover, microwave pre-treatment in TUF or DET gave excellent and specific staining with the majority of MAbs tested, comparable with or even better than staining obtained on frozen sections. Using microwave antigen retrieval, tissue morphology remained optimal, and only in a very limited number of MAbs did immunoreactivity on paraffin sections fail to be restored. Proteolytic pre-treatment with trypsin, pepsin, or pronase gave moderate to strong staining with some of the MAbs. Other MAbs, for which microwave pre-treatment was able to restore the loss of immunoreactivity, failed to give appropriate staining with proteolytic pre-treatment.

Epithelial hyperplasia was observed in all wild-type p53 MPRs with one small focal cancer and no evidence of metastasis. Prostatic cancer was found in 100% of the heterozygous and homozygous p53 mutant MPRs with metastatic deposits in 95% of the mice. The pattern of metastasis was remarkably similar to that in human prostate cancer with gross metastatic deposits in the lung, lymph nodes, bone and liver of many animals. Progression of carcinomas in the ras+myc-initiated heterozygous p53 mutant MPRs was invariably associated with either complete loss, partial deletion or loss of expression of the wild-type p53 allele.

7533655,"Radiation therapy in the management of patients with malignant carcinoid tumors. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of radiotherapy for symptomatic, metastatic, and/or unresectable carcinoid tumors. From 1975 to 1991, 18 patients with histologically proven carcinoid tumors, including 7 with symptomatic hepatic involvement, received radiotherapy to a total of 31 anatomic sites of metastatic or unresectable carcinoid tumors. Symptomatic response to treatment, date of symptomatic or radiographic progression, and survival after diagnosis and completion of radiotherapy were determined. Clinical improvement was defined as symptomatic relief and/or objective reduction in size of tumor mass sustained for at least 4 weeks. After radiotherapy of 31 sites in 18 patients, 3 patients died in less than 3 months. Of the remaining 15 patients, survival from initial radiotherapy ranged from 8 to 108 months (median, 23 months), and 8 (53%) died without symptomatic progression in the treated region. Clinical improvement occurred in 27/31 sites (87%). Acute side effects were mild, and no late side effects were recorded. Median survivals from diagnosis were: 39 months for patients with primary tumors of the lung, 33 months for patients with brain metastases, and 32 months for patients with hepatic involvement. Patients with the carcinoid syndrome responded in 19/22 sites (86%) compared with 8/9 sites (89%) for patients without the syndrome (P = not significant).

This secretion is unaffected by the pretreatment with pertussis toxin, cholera toxin and benzalkonium chloride. Histamine release induced by compound 48/80, was markedly inhibited by pertussis toxin, cholera toxin, benzalkonium chloride and neuraminidase. The ADR dose-response curve is significantly shifted to the right when cells were preincubated with the unspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX. The activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with the phorbol esther TPA increases the response to ADR, while PKC inhibition with trifluoperazine decreases histamine release.

7531595,"Adrenergic and non-adrenergic spinal projections of a cardiovascular-active pressor area of medulla oblongata: quantitative topographic analysis. A cardiovascular-active pressor area of medullary reticular formation was defined by mapping changes in arterial blood pressure produced by microinjections of the neuroexcitatory amino acid, L-Glutamate (L-Glu). Sites where L-Glu provoked pressor responses larger than 10 mmHg were localized to a rostral longitudinal cell column of the nucleus reticularis rostroventrolateralis (n.RVL) extending 450 microns posteriorly to the facial nucleus. Spinal projections from the ventrolateral medulla were studied with a dual retrograde transport-immunocytochemical method. A striking correspondence was observed between the ventrolateral pressor area (VLPA) of n.RVL and rostrocaudal distribution of a circumscribed population of thoracic reticulospinal neurons containing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)- or phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT)_immunoreactivity. Quantitative analysis revealed that 72% of the total number of retrogradely labeled neurons within the active area were immunocytochemically positive for TH; 28% of the reticulospinal projection cells were immunonegative. Deposits of L-Glu and dye through the same micropipettes verified a consistent correlation of vasopressor sites and the rostral subset of catecholaminergic neurons. Since comparable numbers of cell bodies in the VLPA contain TH and PNMT all are presumed to be adrenergic. At levels of n.RVL immediately adjacent to the VLPA commencing at a level 450 microns caudal to the facial nucleus, sites were unresponsive to Glu-stimulation or vasodepressor. At these levels, only non-adrenergic reticulospinal neurons project to cervical or thoracic spinal segments. We conclude that the VLPA is highly restricted to a narrow column of n.RVL < 0.5 mm in length and corresponds precisely with a population of predominantly adrenergic thoracic reticulospinal neurons that project exclusively to sympathoadrenal preganglionic motoneurons [cf 46]. These findings corroborate the idea that an adrenergic-spinal pathway may play a role in controlling sympathetic outflow.",Immunology,adrenergic nonadrenergic spinal projection cardiovascularactive pressor area medulla oblongata quantitative topographic analysis cardiovascularactive pressor area medullary reticular formation defined mapping change arterial blood pressure produced microinjections neuroexcitatory amino acid lglutamate lglu site lglu provoked pressor response larger mmhg localized rostral longitudinal cell column nucleus reticularis rostroventrolateralis nrvl extending micron posteriorly facial nucleus spinal projection ventrolateral medulla studied dual retrograde transportimmunocytochemical method striking correspondence observed ventrolateral pressor area vlpa nrvl rostrocaudal distribution circumscribed population thoracic reticulospinal neuron containing tyrosine hydroxylase th phenylethanolamine nmethyltransferase pnmtimmunoreactivity quantitative analysis revealed total number retrogradely labeled neuron within active area immunocytochemically positive th reticulospinal projection cell immunonegative deposit lglu dye micropipettes verified consistent correlation vasopressor site rostral subset catecholaminergic neuron since comparable number cell body vlpa contain th pnmt presumed adrenergic level nrvl immediately adjacent vlpa commencing level micron caudal facial nucleus site unresponsive glustimulation vasodepressor level nonadrenergic reticulospinal neuron project cervical thoracic spinal segment conclude vlpa highly restricted narrow column nrvl mm length corresponds precisely population predominantly adrenergic thoracic reticulospinal neuron project exclusively sympathoadrenal preganglionic motoneuron cf finding corroborate idea adrenergicspinal pathway may play role controlling sympathetic outflow

7529856,"Quantitative nuclear morphometry, Markovian texture descriptors, and DNA content captured on a CAS-200 Image analysis system, combined with PCNA and HER-2/neu immunohistochemistry for prediction of prostate cancer progression. One hundred and twenty-four localized prostate cancer patients operated on at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) since 1975 were identified. The sample was optimized for evaluation of prostate cancer progression. Based upon accurate clinical histories, these radical prostatectomy patients included 50 progressors and 74 non-progressors using appearance of serum PSA as an indication of recurrence (mean follow-up = 8.6 +/- 1.8 years, range 7-15 years). All patients included in the study had no involvement of their seminal vesicles or lymph nodes at the time of prostatectomy. Average time to progression was 3.6 +/- 2 years, range of 1-8 years. Using paraffin-embedded specimens, several five micron sections were cut and placed on Probe-On slides; one slide was H&E-stained and the other was Feulgen-stained. The H&E and Feulgen-stained slides were screened and ""dotted"" by pathologists at JHH and CytoDynostics, Inc. A CAS-200 Image analysis system (Cell Image Systems, Elmhurst, IL) equipped with a Cell Measurement Program version 1.2 beta, was used to capture the Feulgen-stained images and to perform the calculations. From the ""dotted"" areas, 150 cancer cells were selected for measurement of DNA content and 27 nuclear morphometric shape and size factors, including 21 Markovian chromatin texture variables. Additional sections were used for immunochemistry staining with an alkaline phosphatase streptavidin-biotin complex stain to detect and quantitate cancer cells binding monoclonal antibodies directed against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and HER-2/neu antigen. All data were entered into a statistical program (STATA) for further analysis and univariate and multivariate statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression and its stepwise variant. The biomarkers of greatest utility to detect progressors when analyzed univariately included post-operative Gleason score (p = < 0.0001), HER-2/neu antigenicity (p = 0.0147), CAS-200 DNA ploidy (p = 0.008), and twelve Markovian nuclear texture and shape features (p = < 0.0001), whereas PCNA (p = 0.160) failed. The optimal set of nuclear morphometry progression tumor features were selected using backward stepwise logistic regression estimate analysis which drops variables due to collinearity. Although post-operative Gleason score is a strong univariate predictor of progression, DNA ploidy and HER-2/neu contributed significantly to further stratification of higher risk groups within the low Gleason score subpopulation.

7529821,"Intracellular pH changes produced by glutamate uptake in rat hippocampal slices. 1. The mean intracellular pH in area CA1 of rat hippocampal slices was monitored fluorescently after loading the cells with the dye BCECF-AM. 2. Including L-glutamate in the solution superfusing the slice led to the intracellular pH becoming more acid. This acidification had a roughly Michaelis-Menten dependence on the superfused glutamate concentration with a half-maximal dose around 200 microM: this value must overestimate the glutamate concentration at most of the cells, which will be reduced by uptake. 3. The glutamate-evoked acidification was not significantly reduced by blockers of glutamate-gated ion channels [6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3- dione (CNQX) and D-aminophosphonovalerate (APV)] nor by blockers of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)- and glycine-gated channels (picrotoxin and strychnine), and so was not produced by H+ entry through alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channels nor by HCO3- exit through the chloride channels controlled by GABA or glycine. 4. The glutamate-evoked acidification was not reduced by tetrodotoxin (TTX), ruling out the possibility of it being generated by action potentials. It was also unaffected by saturation of presynaptic L-amino-4-phosphonobutanoate (AP4) receptors with AP4. 5. In the presence of blockers of glutamate-, GABA-, and glycine-gated channels, the acidification showed the pharmacology of glutamate uptake and was reduced by a glutamate uptake blocker. 6. The glutamate-evoked acidification showed an ion dependence similar to that of glutamate uptake. It was abolished by removal of extracellular sodium and was reduced by raising the extracellular potassium concentration. It was unaffected by blockers of Na+/H+ exchange (amiloride) and Na+/HCO3- cotransport [4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS)] and so was not produced by the Na+ influx accompanying glutamate uptake changing the activity of these carriers. 7. These data show that the glutamate uptake carrier acidifies hippocampal cells, possibly because it transports a pH-changing anion out of the cell as in salamander glial cells.

7527748,"IgM anti-A and D SnRNP proteins and IgM anti-dsDNA are closely associated in SLE sera. U1RNP and Sm precipitins occur in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and in overlap syndromes, while precipitins to Ro/SSA and La/SSB occur in SLE and its variants as well as Sjögren's syndrome. In studying IgM and IgG antibodies to these polypeptides by Western blot, we found the expected frequency of antibodies to the A protein of the U1RNP specificity and the D protein of the Sm specificity in sera with precipitins to U1RNP and Sm, but also found the frequent occurrence of both IgM and IgG anti-A and D in SLE sera with no precipitins, and in sera with anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/SSB precipitins, but not in sera from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis, scleroderma, or normals. We have studied the sera which bind the A and D polypeptides on Western blot to test their ability to bind native U1RNP (which contain the A and D proteins) in ELISA. The results indicate that most anti-Ro/SSA alone, anti-Ro/SSA, and anti-La/SSB sera as well as SLE sera with no precipitins react preferentially with the denatured A and D proteins. Further study of sera with IgM anti-A and D in Western blot reveals that these sera also frequently contain anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies. These results show that the anti-A and D responses, especially IgM anti-A and D, occur not only in patients with precipitating antibodies to SnRNPs, but in almost half of patients across the lupus spectrum.

7527685,"Combination of interleukin-2-stimulated lymphocytes and bispecific antibodies that efficiently lyse leukemic cells does not affect bone marrow CD34-positive stem cell function in vitro. We have recently reported that a combination of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and bispecific antibodies (BsAb) efficiently lysed autologous and allogeneic leukemic blasts that had surface antigens reactive with the BsAb. The effector cells used in that experiment were peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with interleukin-2 (IL-2) for 2 weeks, with the initial addition of anti-CD3 moAb; these were termed T3-LAK effector cells. In this study, we examined the effects of T3-LAK cells and BsAb on autologous normal CD34+ BM cells in both cytotoxicity and colony formation assays. When T3-LAK cells were incubated with CD34+ BM cells, low levels of cytotoxicity were induced against the CD34+ BM cells and the cytotoxicity was enhanced by the addition of anti-CD3 Fab' x anti-CD 13 Fab' BsAb but not by the addition of anti-CD3 Fab' x anti-CD10 Fab' BsAb. This enhancement appeared to be due to the lysis of CD34+CD13+ BM cells. When T3-LAK cells were preincubated with CD34+ BM cells in the presence or absence of the BsAb and plated for colony assay, neither the T3-LAK cells nor the BsAb affected granulocyte-macrophage or mixed-cell colony formation by CD34+ BM cells. Taken together with our previous finding that T3-LAK cells used in combination with the BsAb markedly inhibited colony formation by leukemic progenitor cells, these results indicate that this combination provides a potential new strategy for CD34+ BM cell purging in autologous BMT.",Immunology,combination interleukinstimulated lymphocyte bispecific antibody efficiently lyse leukemic cell affect bone marrow cdpositive stem cell function vitro recently reported combination lymphokineactivated killer lak cell bispecific antibody bsab efficiently lysed autologous allogeneic leukemic blast surface antigen reactive bsab effector cell used experiment peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulated interleukin il week initial addition anticd moab termed tlak effector cell study examined effect tlak cell bsab autologous normal cd bm cell cytotoxicity colony formation assay tlak cell incubated cd bm cell low level cytotoxicity induced cd bm cell cytotoxicity enhanced addition anticd fab anticd fab bsab addition anticd fab anticd fab bsab enhancement appeared due lysis cdcd bm cell tlak cell preincubated cd bm cell presence absence bsab plated colony assay neither tlak cell bsab affected granulocytemacrophage mixedcell colony formation cd bm cell taken together previous finding tlak cell used combination bsab markedly inhibited colony formation leukemic progenitor cell result indicate combination provides potential new strategy cd bm cell purging autologous bmt

This report describes the production and characterization of a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) TJ4C4, which is directed against the interferon-induced double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase p68 (PKR). The mAb TJ4C4 was produced against p68 which was isolated using a partially purified p68 preparation from human cells. The specificity of this mAb is demonstrated in competitive inhibition assays using recombinantly produced p68 protein and by immunoprecipitation. This mAb is of particular value in that it detects an epitope on p68 which is not destroyed in routinely prepared, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, or in a variety of other commonly used clinical fixatives. The inhibition of mAb TJ4C4 by recombinantly produced p68, on human tissues sections, validates the specificity of this mAb in histological studies. Therefore, mAb TJ4C4 serves as a specific probe to study p68 expression in clinically derived tissue specimens.",Immunology,characterization mouse monoclonal antibody tjc directed human kinase report describes production characterization mouse monoclonal antibody mab tjc directed interferoninduced doublestranded rnaactivated protein kinase pkr mab tjc produced isolated using partially purified preparation human cell specificity mab demonstrated competitive inhibition assay using recombinantly produced protein immunoprecipitation mab particular value detects epitope destroyed routinely prepared formalinfixed paraffinembedded tissue variety commonly used clinical fixative inhibition mab tjc recombinantly produced human tissue section validates specificity mab histological study therefore mab tjc serf specific probe study expression clinically derived tissue specimen

7526537,"Interferon induction by HIV glycoprotein 120: role of the V3 loop. We have studied the mechanism of IFN induction by HIV-1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), using recombinant viral membrane glycoproteins as potential inducers. Whereas 8 nM HIVIIIB-derived gp120 resulted in IFN levels between 80 and 2000 IU/ml with PBMC from different donors, gp120 from the MN strain was not an inducer. Preincubation of HIVIIIB-gp120 with a monoclonal antibody (mAB) to its CD4 binding domain or of PBMC with a mAB to the gp120 binding domain of CD4 abolished IFN induction. Antibodies against the third extracellular domain of CD4 which did not block binding of gp120, however, were also inhibitory. Furthermore, several mABs to the third variable loop (V3) of HIVIIIB-gp120 also blocked IFN induction, suggesting an important role of V3 in this process. This was further supported by the inhibitory action of peptides homologous to complete or partial sequences of V3. We conclude that after binding of gp120 to its CD4 receptor the V3 loop can be positioned close to the membrane of the responder cells by bending of gp120-occupied CD4 at its hinge region between extracellular domains 2 and 3. As a result V3 is able to interact with a V3-specific ""secondary receptor"" on the membranes of these cells. We suggest that it is the latter interaction which triggers IFN induction.",Immunology,interferon induction hiv glycoprotein role loop studied mechanism ifn induction hiv peripheral blood mononuclear cell pbmc using recombinant viral membrane glycoprotein potential inducer whereas nm hiviiibderived gp resulted ifn level iuml pbmc different donor gp mn strain inducer preincubation hiviiibgp monoclonal antibody mab cd binding domain pbmc mab gp binding domain cd abolished ifn induction antibody third extracellular domain cd block binding gp however also inhibitory furthermore several mabs third variable loop hiviiibgp also blocked ifn induction suggesting important role process supported inhibitory action peptide homologous complete partial sequence conclude binding gp cd receptor loop positioned close membrane responder cell bending gpoccupied cd hinge region extracellular domain result able interact vspecific secondary receptor membrane cell suggest latter interaction trigger ifn induction

It is closely related with the biological and human fundamental sciences and with the medical disciplines concerned with the care of old patients. Its issues are ubiquitous and also interest non psychiatrists, particularly geriatricians, internists, neurologists and psychologists. Therefore there is a risk for research to be spread out. As a medicine of synthesis, it must assert itself as a convergence point for the related branches. Its very vast field of research is confronted with particular methodological problems, like the chronological and biological age, the heterogeneity of the population, the polymorbidity. Psychogeriatrics is young and still requires an important involvement in the clinical tasks, in the medico-social coordination and in the teaching to medical and paramedical circles.

7526441,"The antibody MY4 recognizes CD14 on porcine monocytes and macrophages. Several monoclonal antibodies directed against the human CD14 antigen have been established. We now report that the antibody My4, but not LeuM3, reacts with porcine monocytes. Among porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), 14.6% of the cells stain with the CD14 antibody My4, which is similar to the percentage obtained with the antiporcine monocyte antibody 74-22-15. Two-colour immunofluorescence reveals that My4 and 74-22-15 antigens are coexpressed on the same cells, and cell sorter-purified My4+ cells exhibit the morphology of monocytes. Whole blood analysis (which also shows staining of granulocytes) reveals that the average percentage of My4+ monocytes amongst all leucocytes is 5.8% with 580 cells/microliters. Furthermore, porcine peritoneal macrophages (PM) and alveolar macrophages (AM), both stain for My4, with a four-fold lower level on AM. Treatment of cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C decreases My4 staining, but does not affect staining with antibody 74-22-15. Immunoprecipitation with the My4 antibody from surface labelled pig mononuclear cells demonstrates a 54 kDa band similar to human CD14, and Western blotting with pig serum demonstrates two bands similar to the alpha and beta forms of human soluble CD14.

7520778,"The immunosuppressant rapamycin blocks in vitro responses to hematopoietic cytokines and inhibits recovering but not steady-state hematopoiesis in vivo. The immunosuppressive drug rapamycin suppresses T-cell activation by impairing the T-cell response to lymphokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-4 (IL-4). In addition, rapamycin blocks the proliferative response of cell lines to a variety of hematopoietic growth factors, including interleukin-3 (IL-3), interleukin-6 (IL-6), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and kit ligand (KL), suggesting that it should be a strong inhibitor of hematopoiesis. In this report, we studied the effects of rapamycin on different hematopoietic cell populations in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, rapamycin inhibited the proliferation of primary bone marrow cells induced by IL-3, GM-CSF, KL, or a complex mixture of factors present in cell-conditioned media. Rapamycin also inhibited the multiplication of colony-forming cells in suspension cultures containing IL-3 plus interleukin-1 (IL-1) or interleukin-11 (IL-11) plus KL. In vivo, treatment for 10 to 28 days with high doses of rapamycin (50 mg/kg/d, orally) had no effect on myelopoiesis in normal mice, as measured by bone marrow cellularity, proliferative capacity, and number of colony-forming progenitors. In contrast, the same treatment strongly suppressed the hematopoietic recovery normally seen 10 days after an injection of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 150 mg/kg, intravenously [i.v.]). Thus, rapamycin may be detrimental in myelocompromised individuals. In addition, the results suggest that the rapamycin-sensitive cytokine-driven pathways are essential for hematopoietic recovery after myelodepression, but not for steady-state hematopoiesis.",Immunology,immunosuppressant rapamycin block vitro response hematopoietic cytokine inhibits recovering steadystate hematopoiesis vivo immunosuppressive drug rapamycin suppresses tcell activation impairing tcell response lymphokine interleukin il interleukin il addition rapamycin block proliferative response cell line variety hematopoietic growth factor including interleukin il interleukin il granulocytecolony stimulating factor gcsf granulocyte macrophagecolony stimulating factor gmcsf kit ligand kl suggesting strong inhibitor hematopoiesis report studied effect rapamycin different hematopoietic cell population vitro vivo vitro rapamycin inhibited proliferation primary bone marrow cell induced il gmcsf kl complex mixture factor present cellconditioned medium rapamycin also inhibited multiplication colonyforming cell suspension culture containing il plus interleukin il interleukin il plus kl vivo treatment day high dos rapamycin mgkgd orally effect myelopoiesis normal mouse measured bone marrow cellularity proliferative capacity number colonyforming progenitor contrast treatment strongly suppressed hematopoietic recovery normally seen day injection fluorouracil fu mgkg intravenously iv thus rapamycin may detrimental myelocompromised individual addition result suggest rapamycinsensitive cytokinedriven pathway essential hematopoietic recovery myelodepression steadystate hematopoiesis

New data on genetic factors in the pathogenesis, 2. molecular activation mechanisms in metastasis and 3. endocrine dedifferentiation during the course of the disease causing androgen independent state. Recent epidemiological analyses have clearly shown, that a specific part of prostate cancer is inherited. By DNA-interphase analyses specific allelic losses have been demonstrated. Metastatic progression is both associated with oncogene ras activation and chromosomal deletions. Endocrinological dedifferentiation cannot be simply explained by an overgrowth by androgen-receptor negative tumor cells, but by a more complex deregulation with strong influences by stromal-epithelial interactions.

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is the most important procedure in preoperative diagnosis of thyroid neoplasms. However, routine cytological examination is insufficient for differentiation between follicular adenoma and follicular carcinoma. Therefore, we decided to assess the usefulness of karyometric analysis in the examination of aspirates from these neoplasms. Morphometric analysis was performed with the use of the computer system for karyometric measurements--""Karyometry Manager"" ver. 1.2. We examined cytological smears derived from 26 patients. In 10 of them a nodular goitre was diagnosed in both cytological and histopathological examinations. In the other 16 patients, ""follicular neoplasms"" were found in cytological examination. These proved to be follicular adenomas (8 cases) and follicular carcinomas (8 cases) on histopathological examination. The following morphometric parameters were measured in 100 nuclei per smear: volume, intersection area, perimeter, convexity coefficient and shape coefficient. We found that: 1) the mean volume and the mean intersection area of thyrocyte nuclei from follicular carcinomas were significantly (p < 0.001) greater than those of nuclei from adenomas or nodular goitres; 2) the mean perimeter of thyrocyte nuclei from follicular carcinomas was significantly greater than the mean perimeter of thyrocyte nuclei from follicular adenomas (p < 0.025) and nodular goitres (p < 0.001); 3) the mean nuclear area of thyrocytes from follicular adenomas was significantly greater than that of thyrocytes from nodular goitres (p < 0.05).

Flow-induced contraction depends upon extracellular Ca++, but the underlying Ca++ entry pathway involved is unknown. We chose the rabbit facial vein to carry out this study because, in addition to contracting to a number of pharmacological agents and developing myogenic tone in response to stretch in vitro, flow-induced contraction also can be consistently demonstrated. Our goal was to determined whether the Ca++ entry pathway for flow-induced contraction could be distinguished from that involved in K(+)-, histamine- and stretch-induced contraction through the use of a Ca++ entry activator: Bay K 8644 and the Ca++ entry blockers nifedipine, diltiazem and verapamil and also cobalt and manganese. All four types of contractions studied are dependent on extracellular Ca++ Flow- and K(+)-induced contraction were equally sensitive to inhibition by nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem. Those to histamine and stretch were not. Furthermore, the flow- and K(+)-induced contractions were enhanced equivalently by the calcium channel activator, Bay K 8644, but to a lesser degree than those to histamine and stretch. The inorganic calcium channel blockers, Co++ and Mn++ effected equally flow-, K(+)- and histamine-induced contraction. They were more potent in their inhibition of stretch-induced contraction.

7501868,"Bioaccumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by marine organisms. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous in the marine environment, occurring at their highest environmental concentrations around urban centers. While they can occur naturally, the highest concentrations are mainly from human activities, and the primary sources are combustion products and petroleum. Two factors, lipid and organic carbon, control to a large extent the partitioning behavior of PAHs in sediment, water, and tissue; the more hydrophobic a compound, the greater the partitioning to these phases. These two factors, along with the octanol-water partition coefficient, are the best predictors of this partitioning and can be used to determine PAH behavior and its bioavailability in the environment. It is well known that the lipid of organisms contains the highest levels of hydrophobic compounds such as PAHs, and that organic carbon associated with sediment or dissolved in water can have the greatest influence on PAH bioavailability. Partitioning of combustion-derived PAHs between water and sediment may be much less than predicted, possibly because associations with particles are much stronger than expected. This reduced partitioning may produce erroneous results in predicting bioaccumulation where uptake from water is important. Accumulation of PAHs occurs in all marine organisms; however, there is a wide range in tissue concentrations from variable environmental concentrations, level and time of exposure, and species ability to metabolize these compounds. PAHs generally partition into lipid-rich tissues, and their metabolites can be found in most tissues. In fish, liver and bile accumulate the highest levels of parent PAH and metabolites; hence, these are the best tissues to analyze when determining PAH exposure. In invertebrates, the highest concentrations can be found in the internal organs, such as the hepatopancreas, and tissue concentrations appear to follow seasonal cycles, which may be related to variations in lipid content or spawning cycles. The major route of uptake for PAHs has been debated for years. For the more water-soluble PAHs, it is believed that the main route of uptake is through ventilated water and that the more hydrophobic compounds are taken in mainly through ingestion of food or sediment. There are many variables, such as chemical hydrophobicity, uptake efficiency, feeding rate, and ventilatory volume, which may affect the outcome. The route of uptake may be an important issue for short-term events; however, under long-term exposure and equilibrium conditions between water, prey, and sediment, the route of uptake may be immaterial because the same tissue burdens will be achieved regardless of uptake routes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Immunology,bioaccumulation polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon marine organism polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pahs ubiquitous marine environment occurring highest environmental concentration around urban center occur naturally highest concentration mainly human activity primary source combustion product petroleum two factor lipid organic carbon control large extent partitioning behavior pahs sediment water tissue hydrophobic compound greater partitioning phase two factor along octanolwater partition coefficient best predictor partitioning used determine pah behavior bioavailability environment well known lipid organism contains highest level hydrophobic compound pahs organic carbon associated sediment dissolved water greatest influence pah bioavailability partitioning combustionderived pahs water sediment may much le predicted possibly association particle much stronger expected reduced partitioning may produce erroneous result predicting bioaccumulation uptake water important accumulation pahs occurs marine organism however wide range tissue concentration variable environmental concentration level time exposure specie ability metabolize compound pahs generally partition lipidrich tissue metabolite found tissue fish liver bile accumulate highest level parent pah metabolite hence best tissue analyze determining pah exposure invertebrate highest concentration found internal organ hepatopancreas tissue concentration appear follow seasonal cycle may related variation lipid content spawning cycle major route uptake pahs debated year watersoluble pahs believed main route uptake ventilated water hydrophobic compound taken mainly ingestion food sediment many variable chemical hydrophobicity uptake efficiency feeding rate ventilatory volume may affect outcome route uptake may important issue shortterm event however longterm exposure equilibrium condition water prey sediment route uptake may immaterial tissue burden achieved regardless uptake routesabstract truncated word

7542539,"Localization and expression of a collecting duct water channel, aquaporin, in hydrated and dehydrated rats. The cellular and subcellular localization and expression of a kidney collecting duct water channel, aquaporin (AQP)-CD, were examined in the kidneys of hydrated and dehydrated rats by immunostaining, Northern blot analysis, and radioimmunoassay. In hydrated rat kidneys, AQP-CD was selectively found in the collecting duct principal cells and inner medullary collecting duct cells, but not in the intercalated cells. At a light microscopic level, AQP-CD was diffusely present in a granular pattern throughout the cytoplasm of the collecting duct cells with a preferential accumulation in subapical regions. By immunoelectron microscopy, AQP-CD was frequently demonstrated along membranes of small vesicles in the subapical cytoplasm and occasionally along the basolateral membranes of these cells. However, immunolabeling was sparse on the apical membranes. In dehydrated rats, AQP-CD immunostaining was intensified in the subapical cytoplasm of the collecting duct cells, along with increases in the number and size of AQP-CD-bearing vesicles in the subapical regions and with increment of labeling along the apical membranes. The increase in the amount of AQP-CD in the collecting duct cells of dehydrated rat kidneys was quantitatively confirmed by elevation of AQP-CD at mRNA and protein levels.

7542351,"Recognition molecules myelin-associated glycoprotein and tenascin-C inhibit integrin-mediated adhesion of neural cells to collagen. Because of the importance of collagens in mediating cell-substrate interactions and the association of collagens with neural recognition molecules in the peripheral nervous system, the ability of neural recognition molecules to modify the substrate properties of collagens, in particular collagen type I, for cell adhesion was determined. Two cell lines, the N2A neuroblastoma and PC12 pheochromocytoma, were investigated for their capacity to adhere to different collagen types in the absence or presence of several neural recognition molecules. Adhesion of N2A or PC12 cells and membrane vesicles from PC12 cells to collagen type I was reduced when the collagen had been preincubated prior to its application as substrate with the extracellular domain of myelin-associated glycoprotein (s-MAG) or, as control, fibroblast tenascin-C (F-tenascin). In mixture with other collagen types, s-MAG was only able to reduce the adhesiveness of collagen types III and V, but not of collagen types II and IV. F-tenascin reduced the adhesiveness of all collagen types tested. In contrast to F-tenascin, s-MAG had to be present during fibrillogenesis to exert its effect, indicating that it must be coassembled into the collagen fibril to block the binding site. Cell adhesion to collagen type I was dependent on Mg2+ or Mn2+ and inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to the alpha 1 integrin subunit. The combined observations indicate that s-MAG and F-tenascin interfere with cell binding, most probably by modifying the integrin binding site, and that the two molecules act by different mechanisms, both leading to reduction of adhesion.",Genome engineering,recognition molecule myelinassociated glycoprotein tenascinc inhibit integrinmediated adhesion neural cell collagen importance collagen mediating cellsubstrate interaction association collagen neural recognition molecule peripheral nervous system ability neural recognition molecule modify substrate property collagen particular collagen type cell adhesion determined two cell line na neuroblastoma pc pheochromocytoma investigated capacity adhere different collagen type absence presence several neural recognition molecule adhesion na pc cell membrane vesicle pc cell collagen type reduced collagen preincubated prior application substrate extracellular domain myelinassociated glycoprotein smag control fibroblast tenascinc ftenascin mixture collagen type smag able reduce adhesiveness collagen type iii collagen type ii iv ftenascin reduced adhesiveness collagen type tested contrast ftenascin smag present fibrillogenesis exert effect indicating must coassembled collagen fibril block binding site cell adhesion collagen type dependent mg mn inhibited monoclonal antibody alpha integrin subunit combined observation indicate smag ftenascin interfere cell binding probably modifying integrin binding site two molecule act different mechanism leading reduction adhesion
7541250,"tRNAs as primer of reverse transcriptases. Genetic elements coding for proteins that present amino acid identity with the conserved motifs of retroviral reverse transcriptases constitute the retroid family. With the exception of reverse transcriptases encoded by mitochondrial plasmids of Neurospora, all reverse transcriptases have an absolute requirement for a primer to initiate DNA synthesis. In retroviruses, plant pararetroviruses, and retrotransposons (transposons containing long terminal repeats), DNA synthesis is primed by specific tRNAs. All these retroelements contain a primer binding site presenting a Watson-Crick complementarity with the primer tRNA. The tRNAs most widely used as primers are tRNA(Trp), tRNA(Pro), tRNA(1,2Lys), tRNA(3Lys), tRNA(iMet). Other tRNAs such as tRNA(Gln), tRNA(Leu), tRNA(Ser), tRNA(Asn) and tRNA(Arg) are also occasionally used as primers. In the retroviruses and plant pararetroviruses, the primer binding site is complementary to the 3' end of the primer tRNA. In the case of retrotransposons, the primer binding site is either complementary to the 3' end or to an internal region of the primer tRNA. Additional interactions taking place between the primer tRNA and the retro-RNA outside of the primer binding site have been evidenced in the case of Rous sarcoma virus, human immunodeficiency virus type I, and yeast retrotransposon Ty1. A selective encapsidation of the primer tRNA, probably promoted by interactions with reverse transcriptase, occurs during the formation of virus or virus-like particles. Annealing of the primer tRNA to the primer binding site appears to be mediated by reverse transcriptase and/or the nucleocapsid protein. Modified nucleosides of the primer tRNA have been shown to be important for replication of the primer binding site, encapsidation of the primer (in the case of Rous sarcoma virus), and interaction with the genomic RNA (in the case of human immunodeficiency virus type I).",Genome engineering,trna primer reverse transcriptase genetic element coding protein present amino acid identity conserved motif retroviral reverse transcriptase constitute retroid family exception reverse transcriptase encoded mitochondrial plasmid neurospora reverse transcriptase absolute requirement primer initiate dna synthesis retrovirus plant pararetroviruses retrotransposons transposon containing long terminal repeat dna synthesis primed specific trna retroelements contain primer binding site presenting watsoncrick complementarity primer trna trna widely used primer trnatrp trnapro trnalys trnalys trnaimet trna trnagln trnaleu trnaser trnaasn trnaarg also occasionally used primer retrovirus plant pararetroviruses primer binding site complementary end primer trna case retrotransposons primer binding site either complementary end internal region primer trna additional interaction taking place primer trna retrorna outside primer binding site evidenced case rous sarcoma virus human immunodeficiency virus type yeast retrotransposon ty selective encapsidation primer trna probably promoted interaction reverse transcriptase occurs formation virus viruslike particle annealing primer trna primer binding site appears mediated reverse transcriptase andor nucleocapsid protein modified nucleoside primer trna shown important replication primer binding site encapsidation primer case rous sarcoma virus interaction genomic rna case human immunodeficiency virus type
7541243,"Novel RNA substrates for the ribozyme from Bacillus subtilis ribonuclease P identified by in vitro selection. Novel RNA substrates for the ribozyme from Bacillus subtilis ribonuclease P (P RNA) have been obtained by in vitro selection. The selection method involves cleavage of a circular RNA library by the P RNA, isolation of the linear cleavage product, and regeneration of circular RNA to allow amplification and multiple cycles of selection. The use of circular RNA ensures that potential substrates can be selected without restricted location of the cleavage site. Such a selection method has been used previously to isolate RNA motifs that undergo autolytic cleavage with Pb2+ [Pan, T., & Uhlenbeck, O. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 3887-3895]. The circular RNA pool after eight cycles of selection was cleaved by the B. subtilis P RNA as efficiently as a pre-tRNA(Phe) substrate, estimated to be more than 10 orders of magnitude better than the unselected RNA library. Kinetic analysis of individual variants showed that the kcat/KM of the selected RNA was up to 4-fold higher than that of the pre-tRNA(Phe). When cleavage was carried out with Escherichia coli P RNA, the selected RNA was 10-60-fold less reactive than the reaction of the pre-tRNA(Phe). Two distinct classes of variants are selected, both of which appear to differ significantly from the known P RNA substrates. Terminal truncation experiments suggest that a large number of nucleotides in the class I variants can be deleted without affecting the cleavage activity. The resulting minimal class I substrates contain a short stem-loop with no other apparent helical structures. The class II substrates are cleaved within a putative helical stem that is formed entirely by the primer sequences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Genome engineering,novel rna substrate ribozyme bacillus subtilis ribonuclease identified vitro selection novel rna substrate ribozyme bacillus subtilis ribonuclease rna obtained vitro selection selection method involves cleavage circular rna library rna isolation linear cleavage product regeneration circular rna allow amplification multiple cycle selection use circular rna ensures potential substrate selected without restricted location cleavage site selection method used previously isolate rna motif undergo autolytic cleavage pb pan uhlenbeck biochemistry circular rna pool eight cycle selection cleaved subtilis rna efficiently pretrnaphe substrate estimated order magnitude better unselected rna library kinetic analysis individual variant showed kcatkm selected rna fold higher pretrnaphe cleavage carried escherichia coli rna selected rna fold le reactive reaction pretrnaphe two distinct class variant selected appear differ significantly known rna substrate terminal truncation experiment suggest large number nucleotide class variant deleted without affecting cleavage activity resulting minimal class substrate contain short stemloop apparent helical structure class ii substrate cleaved within putative helical stem formed entirely primer sequencesabstract truncated word

7539153,"[Palliative treatments of cancers of upper respiratory and digestive tracts]. Palliative treatment of head and neck cancers needs an initial evaluation based upon clinical symptoms and tumoral behaviour. Local recurrences are the most frequent presentation of tumoral failures. The therapeutic management of these local recurrences requires a mixture of unspecific and specific oncologic procedures. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are frequently used in those circumstances in order to reduce the tumoral volume and to facilitate the effectiveness of unspecific treatments. Management of metastatic disease is often impaired by the moderate efficiency of chemotherapy while this treatment leads to marked side effects. Basically, the best therapeutic choice depends on the expected positive balance between the improvement of symptoms and the level of treatment-related side effects. However, daily clinical approach is a better way to care these patients than predefined rigid protocols.",Genome engineering,palliative treatment cancer upper respiratory digestive tract palliative treatment head neck cancer need initial evaluation based upon clinical symptom tumoral behaviour local recurrence frequent presentation tumoral failure therapeutic management local recurrence requires mixture unspecific specific oncologic procedure radiotherapy chemotherapy frequently used circumstance order reduce tumoral volume facilitate effectiveness unspecific treatment management metastatic disease often impaired moderate efficiency chemotherapy treatment lead marked side effect basically best therapeutic choice depends expected positive balance improvement symptom level treatmentrelated side effect however daily clinical approach better way care patient predefined rigid protocol

Stockholm, Sweden, May 12-13, 1993. At a WHO consensus conference on Early Diagnosis and Prognostic Parameters in Localized Prostate Cancer, a working group discussed the clinical utility of DNA measurements in stages T2 and T3 prostate carcinoma. Incidentally discovered prostate cancer of stage T1 was excluded. The members of the working group, representing various clinical and laboratory disciplines, discussed technical considerations of DNA measurements by flow and image analysis, pretreatment prediction of prognosis, and posttreatment clinical relevance. The group agreed to subdivide tumors into diploid, tetraploid and non-tetraploid aneuploid, expressing various degrees of aggressiveness and gave guidance for the definition of limits of these groups. The panel agreed that knowledge on DNA ploidy prior to treatment is of value in treatment decisions, particularly when surveillance is a treatment option. Aneuploid tumors can be expected to respond very poorly to either irradiation or endocrine therapy, and the presence of aneuploid tumor, either on pretreatment biopsies or in radical prostatectomy specimens, is an ominous sign. The identification of a group of patients with a uniformly poor prognosis should encourage medical oncologists and basic scientists to develop adequate treatment options for this particular group.

7529347,"Neointima formation is promoted by surgical preparation and inhibited by cyclic nucleotides in human saphenous vein organ cultures. Intimal thickening is an important cause of late coronary vein graft occlusion, which no variation of surgical technique or pharmacologic intervention has been shown to reduce. We used a recently developed quantitative organ culture of human saphenous vein to investigate whether surgical preparative injury promotes neointima formation. We also investigated the effects on neointima formation of the lipid-soluble cyclic nucleotide analogs, 8-Br-cyclic adenosine monophosphate and 8-Br-cyclic guanosine monophosphate, and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, isobutylmethylxanthine. These agents are pharmacologic mimetics of endothelium-derived prostacyclin and nitric oxide, which elevate vascular smooth muscle cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate concentrations, respectively, and may normally suppress neointima formation. Surgical preparation was found to promote intimal thickening and neointimal smooth muscle cell proliferation by 42% and 48%, respectively. 8-Br-cyclic adenosine monophosphate, 8-Br-cyclic guanosine monophosphate, or isobutylmethylxanthine (which elevated endogenous cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentrations) inhibited intimal thickening by 80%, 40%, and 72%, respectively, at a concentration of 0.1 mmol/L.

7529297,"Unexpected expression of intermediate filament protein genes in human oligodendroglioma cell lines. From a human oligodendroglioma cell line cDNA library, ten intermediate filament (IF) cDNA clones were isolated. Five clones corresponded to vimentin mRNA, two corresponded to cytokeratin K7 mRNA, and two corresponded to cytokeratin K8 mRNA. One clone encoded a novel IF mRNA. The expression of these and other IF protein genes was examined in five cell lines derived from human oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma and neuroblastoma tumors. Vimentin mRNA and K18 mRNA were expressed in all the cell lines. The K7 and K8 genes were expressed only in the oligodendroglioma cell lines. Surprisingly, nestin mRNA was expressed in the astrocytoma lines and the neuroblastoma line, but was not expressed in the oligodendroglioma lines. These results indicate that oligodendroglioma cell lines express Types I and II cytokeratin genes. This pattern of IF gene expression was different from that of the astrocytoma and neuroblastoma cell lines, which expressed IF genes usually associated with the mature cell types or with differentiating fetal neural precursor cells, i.e. GFAP and neurofilament-L.

7518266,"Molecular pharmacology of serotonin receptors. The serotonin system has long been thought to play a role at several steps in the cycle of alcohol abuse. Initial motivation may be triggered by anxiety, which may exhibit a serotonergic component (5-HT1A receptor). Alcohol can potentiate the opening of 5-HT3 receptor ion channels, and agents which elevate serotonergic tone, including serotonergic agonists, uptake inhibitors and releasers, have shown promise in assisting with recovery from alcoholism. In this review, recent advances in serotonin receptor research are presented, with a special emphasis on the impact and interpretation of molecular biological data. Genetic and pharmacological concepts of receptor subtypes are reviewed and related to a new classification system for the 14 currently recognized subtypes of serotonin receptors.

Bimakalim (3 micrograms/kg bolus followed by 0.1 microgram/kg/min intravenously, i.v.) was initiated either 15 min before LCX occlusion and continued throughout the experiments in one group of animals or initiated 5 min before and throughout reperfusion in a second group. A third group of dogs received i.v. vehicle (control) 15 minutes before LCX occlusion and throughout the remainder of the experiment. IS was determined by triphenyltetrazolium histochemical staining, regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) by the radioactive microsphere technique, and neutrophil migration by measurement of tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Bimakalim reduced mean aortic blood pressure (MBP, 25 mm Hg) during the occlusion and reperfusion periods in the group of dogs that received the drug throughout the experiment and reduced in BP, during reperfusion when administered immediately before the reperfusion period. In addition, bimakalim increased LCX coronary artery blood flow (CBF) and increased regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) primarily during reperfusion in both drug-treated groups, with the greatest increase to the subepicardial region. During occlusion, however, bimakalim had no effect on collateral blood flow to the ischemic region.

7515921,"Human T cell-dependent B cell differentiation induced by staphylococcal superantigens. Microbial superantigens (SAgs), by virtue of their binding to TCR V beta elements on T cells and to class II MHC molecules on accessory cells (AC), trigger T cell activation. Although anti-CD3 mAb (which also trigger T cell activation via surface CD3/TCR) can readily induce T cell-dependent B cell differentiation in unmanipulated PBMC cultures, induction of Ig production in SAg-stimulated cultures has usually required special manipulation of the T cells, such as irradiating them or treating them with mitomycin C. We now demonstrate that eight different staphylococcal SAgs, typically at concentrations 10- to 100-fold lower than those required for proliferation, can each trigger unmanipulated peripheral blood and tonsil T cells to drive polyclonal B cell differentiation. Such SAg-induced T cell-dependent generation of Ig-secreting cells (IgSC) requires T cells and B cells only and occurs in the absence of monocytes as long as there are adequate numbers of B cells to serve as (DR+) AC. Physical contact among T cells, responder B cells, and AC (when different from the responder B cells) is required. The fusion protein CTLA4Ig inhibits SAg-induced IgSC generation in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas a control fusion protein has no such effect. In contrast, CTLA4Ig has, at best, only modest effects on SAg-induced T cell proliferation, indicating that CD28 (CTLA4)/B7 (B7-like) interactions play a more prominent role in SAg-induced IgSC generation than in SAg-induced T cell proliferation. These results establish SAg-induced T cell-dependent B cell differentiation as a useful model for T cell/B cell interactions, inasmuch as no other cell types are necessary for successful B cell differentiation; these results also demonstrate the importance of CD28 (CTLA4)/B7 (B7-like)-dependent mechanisms in this process.",Genome engineering,human celldependent cell differentiation induced staphylococcal superantigens microbial superantigens sag virtue binding tcr beta element cell class ii mhc molecule accessory cell ac trigger cell activation although anticd mab also trigger cell activation via surface cdtcr readily induce celldependent cell differentiation unmanipulated pbmc culture induction ig production sagstimulated culture usually required special manipulation cell irradiating treating mitomycin demonstrate eight different staphylococcal sag typically concentration fold lower required proliferation trigger unmanipulated peripheral blood tonsil cell drive polyclonal cell differentiation saginduced celldependent generation igsecreting cell igsc requires cell cell occurs absence monocyte long adequate number cell serve dr ac physical contact among cell responder cell ac different responder cell required fusion protein ctlaig inhibits saginduced igsc generation dosedependent fashion whereas control fusion protein effect contrast ctlaig best modest effect saginduced cell proliferation indicating cd ctlab blike interaction play prominent role saginduced igsc generation saginduced cell proliferation result establish saginduced celldependent cell differentiation useful model cellb cell interaction inasmuch cell type necessary successful cell differentiation result also demonstrate importance cd ctlab blikedependent mechanism process
7515910,"Costimulation through CD28 enhances T cell-dependent B cell activation via CD40-CD40L interaction. Changes in T cell helper function were analyzed when anti-CD3-activated T cells were costimulated with mAbs to the CD28 receptor (anti-CD28). T cell-dependent B cell growth and differentiation were consistently augmented if anti-CD3 stimulated-T cells were simultaneously activated with anti-CD28. Although anti-CD28 enhanced IL-2 and IL-4 production, it did not increase B cell responses solely by augmenting production of soluble lymphokines. Anti-CD28 costimulation induced increases on T cells of CD40 ligand (CD40L), known to promote B cell proliferation and Ig secretion. Because anti-CD28 promoted T cell helper functions and expression of CD40L, we examined the dependence for CD40L during T cell-dependent B cell responses. Although soluble CD40 fusion proteins only partially inhibited T cell-dependent B cell activation, we found a strict requirement for CD40L expression at initiating B cell responses. Both CD40L expression and T cell help were blocked by cyclosporin A after TCR cross-linking, and, unlike T cell proliferation, both remained cyclosporin A sensitive during CD28 costimulation. In addition, anti-CD28 could not compensate for the T cell helper deficiency of hyper IgM syndrome patients who lack functional CD40L. Thus, anti-CD28-induced T cell help is delivered via a CD40L-dependent process. The fact that cross-linking CD40 on B cells promotes expression of the B7/BB-1 ligand for CD28 suggest T and B interactions may have a reciprocal amplification mechanism.",Genome engineering,costimulation cd enhances celldependent cell activation via cdcdl interaction change cell helper function analyzed anticdactivated cell costimulated mabs cd receptor anticd celldependent cell growth differentiation consistently augmented anticd stimulatedt cell simultaneously activated anticd although anticd enhanced il il production increase cell response solely augmenting production soluble lymphokine anticd costimulation induced increase cell cd ligand cdl known promote cell proliferation ig secretion anticd promoted cell helper function expression cdl examined dependence cdl celldependent cell response although soluble cd fusion protein partially inhibited celldependent cell activation found strict requirement cdl expression initiating cell response cdl expression cell help blocked cyclosporin tcr crosslinking unlike cell proliferation remained cyclosporin sensitive cd costimulation addition anticd compensate cell helper deficiency hyper igm syndrome patient lack functional cdl thus anticdinduced cell help delivered via cdldependent process fact crosslinking cd cell promotes expression bbb ligand cd suggest interaction may reciprocal amplification mechanism

Clots prepared from rat or human blood lysed spontaneously within 3-5 h. Clots from hamster blood lysed completely within 30 min but clots prepared from murine or canine blood lysed only after addition of 1.0 IU human t-PA. To study the effect of activated FXIII (FXIIIa) inhibition on blood clot lysis the FXIII inhibitors L722151 and mono-dansylcadaverine (dansyl) were used. In the presence of the FXIII inhibitors human, murine, and canine blood clots showed increased lysis rates. The lysis rate of rat blood clots was not affected. Effects on hamster blood clots could not be detected because of the high basal lysis rate. In clots prepared from human, murine, or canine plasma about 20% of the plasma alpha 2-AP concentration was cross-linked to fibrin. FXIII inhibitors inhibited cross-linking by more than 80%. No significant cross-linking of alpha 2-AP could be detected in rat and hamster plasma clots. When 0.1 volume of human plasma was added to 0.9 volume of rat plasma the level of alpha 2-AP cross-linking was equal to that in human plasma indicating that rat alpha 2-AP can be cross-linked to human fibrin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Genome engineering,crosslinking alpha antiplasmin fibrin key factor regulating blood clot lysis specie difference basal lysis rate exvivo prepared blood clot rat mouse hamster dog human level alpha antiplasmin alpha ap crosslinked fibrin studied presence absence factor xiii fxiii inhibitor using blood clot lysis assay alpha ap binding assay clot prepared rat human blood lysed spontaneously within clot hamster blood lysed completely within min clot prepared murine canine blood lysed addition iu human tpa study effect activated fxiii fxiiia inhibition blood clot lysis fxiii inhibitor monodansylcadaverine dansyl used presence fxiii inhibitor human murine canine blood clot showed increased lysis rate lysis rate rat blood clot affected effect hamster blood clot detected high basal lysis rate clot prepared human murine canine plasma plasma alpha ap concentration crosslinked fibrin fxiii inhibitor inhibited crosslinking significant crosslinking alpha ap detected rat hamster plasma clot volume human plasma added volume rat plasma level alpha ap crosslinking equal human plasma indicating rat alpha ap crosslinked human fibrinabstract truncated word
7511501,"Bispectral analysis of the electroencephalogram during induction of anesthesia may predict hemodynamic responses to laryngoscopy and intubation. The use of electroencephalography as a measure of adequacy of anesthesia has achieved limited success. Our purpose was to determine whether the non-linear properties of the electroencephalogram (EEG) as defined by the bispectral index was a better predictor of autonomic responses to endotracheal intubation during opioid-based anesthesia than the linear statistical properties of the EEG formulated by power spectral analysis. Thirty-nine adults scheduled for elective non-cranial surgery had a continuous EEG recorded during induction of anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia consisted of thiopental and nitrous oxide in oxygen, followed by 1 of 5 randomized opioid dose regimens. The EEG was continuously recorded and blood pressure was measured every minute. All electroencephalographic parameters were derived for the 3 min before and after intubation and were compared to the blood pressure and heart rate responses. Responders were defined by 2 analyses: patients who had a 20% or greater increase (1) in blood pressure or (2) in heart rate to laryngoscopy. Responders and non-responders were compared using Student's unpaired t test, and differences due to dose regimens were examined with logistic regression. Based on the criterion for blood pressure change, there were 27 responders and 12 non-responders. Heart rate changes did not differentiate between the two groups. There was a significant difference between response groups as measured by the bispectral index which distinguished responders from non-responders independently of the amount of drug given. None of the variables of power spectral analysis accurately distinguished responder from non-responder.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Genome engineering,bispectral analysis electroencephalogram induction anesthesia may predict hemodynamic response laryngoscopy intubation use electroencephalography measure adequacy anesthesia achieved limited success purpose determine whether nonlinear property electroencephalogram eeg defined bispectral index better predictor autonomic response endotracheal intubation opioidbased anesthesia linear statistical property eeg formulated power spectral analysis thirtynine adult scheduled elective noncranial surgery continuous eeg recorded induction anesthesia endotracheal intubation anesthesia consisted thiopental nitrous oxide oxygen followed randomized opioid dose regimen eeg continuously recorded blood pressure measured every minute electroencephalographic parameter derived min intubation compared blood pressure heart rate response responder defined analysis patient greater increase blood pressure heart rate laryngoscopy responder nonresponders compared using student unpaired test difference due dose regimen examined logistic regression based criterion blood pressure change responder nonresponders heart rate change differentiate two group significant difference response group measured bispectral index distinguished responder nonresponders independently amount drug given none variable power spectral analysis accurately distinguished responder nonresponderabstract truncated word
7511336,"Heterologous expression of delta F508 CFTR results in decreased sialylation of membrane glycoconjugates. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is commonly mutated in cystic fibrosis to the delta F508 CFTR. CFTR has been shown to function as a adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-dependent Cl- channel at the cell surface, and there is evidence to suggest that CFTR may also have a role in transmembrane Cl- conductance in intracellular membrane compartments. Studies using cells from cystic fibrosis patients or heterologous expression systems have demonstrated that defective Cl- conductance at the cell surface and defective acidification of the Golgi compartment are associated with the presence of mutant forms of CFTR. It is possible that mutation of CFTR could also result in altered Golgi function, consistent with reports of changes in the glycosylation of cell surface and secreted glycoproteins in cystic fibrosis. Glycosylation of cell surface glycoproteins, particularly levels of sialylation, may also be related to the increased binding of Pseudomonas to cystic fibrosis cells. The current study was undertaken to compare the sialylation of cell surface glycoconjugates in heterologous cells overexpressing normal CFTR or delta F508 CFTR. The presence of sialylated residues on cells was assessed by the surface binding of the specific lectins, wheat germ agglutinin and elderberry bark lectin. A fluorescent cholera toxin B subunit probe was used to measure surface binding to sialylated gangliosides in transfected cells. Our studies show that cells lacking CFTR and cells expressing normal CFTR have unaltered levels of sialylation. In contrast, cells expressing the delta F508 CFTR have significantly decreased amounts of sialylated glycoproteins and gangliosides on the cell surface.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Genome engineering,heterologous expression delta cftr result decreased sialylation membrane glycoconjugates cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr commonly mutated cystic fibrosis delta cftr cftr shown function adenosine cyclic monophosphatedependent cl channel cell surface evidence suggest cftr may also role transmembrane cl conductance intracellular membrane compartment study using cell cystic fibrosis patient heterologous expression system demonstrated defective cl conductance cell surface defective acidification golgi compartment associated presence mutant form cftr possible mutation cftr also result altered golgi function consistent report change glycosylation cell surface secreted glycoprotein cystic fibrosis glycosylation cell surface glycoprotein particularly level sialylation may also related increased binding pseudomonas cystic fibrosis cell current study undertaken compare sialylation cell surface glycoconjugates heterologous cell overexpressing normal cftr delta cftr presence sialylated residue cell assessed surface binding specific lectin wheat germ agglutinin elderberry bark lectin fluorescent cholera toxin subunit probe used measure surface binding sialylated gangliosides transfected cell study show cell lacking cftr cell expressing normal cftr unaltered level sialylation contrast cell expressing delta cftr significantly decreased amount sialylated glycoprotein gangliosides cell surfaceabstract truncated word

Generalized seizures induced by kindling are associated with a long-term increase in vasopressin mRNA expression in vasopressin neuroendocrine cells. Since nitric oxide synthase activity is strongly expressed in these neurons and may play a role in mechanisms of plasticity, we used NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry to examine nitric oxide synthase activity 1 month after amygdala kindling. Both the number of stained neurons and average intensity of cellular labeling in the supraoptic nucleus were increased in the kindled rats. In adjacent limbic regions, terminal-like staining was also increased, suggesting a general elevation of limbic nitric oxide synthase activity.

7538426,"Lipoprotein lipase synergizes with interferon gamma to induce macrophage nitric oxide synthetase mRNA expression and nitric oxide production. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) induces macrophage tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene expression and protein secretion. Since TNF-alpha can increase interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)-dependent nitric oxide (NO) production, we studied whether LPL may synergize with IFN-gamma for the induction of macrophage NO production. Although ineffective by itself, LPL in combination with IFN-gamma increased L-arginine-dependent NO production in a dose-dependent manner. Preincubation of LPL with an anti-LPL neutralizing antibody totally suppressed this effect. Increased NO synthetase (NOS) mRNA expression was also observed after macrophage treatment with IFN-gamma and LPL. Protein synthesis was required for the induction of NOS mRNA, and a TNF-alpha-mediated effect of LPL on NOS gene expression and NO production was observed. The ability of LPL to augment IFN-gamma-dependent NOS mRNA expression was associated with an increase in the NOS gene transcriptional activity but not in the NOS mRNA stability. Finally, binding of nuclear proteins to the nuclear factor-kappa B- and TNF-alpha-responsive sequences of the macrophage NOS promotor was decreased by treatment of the cells by IFN-gamma alone or in combination with LPL. These data provide evidence for a link between LPL and arginine metabolism in macrophages and further stress the role of LPL in the regulation of macrophage activation.",Genome engineering,lipoprotein lipase synergizes interferon gamma induce macrophage nitric oxide synthetase mrna expression nitric oxide production lipoprotein lipase lpl induces macrophage tumor necrosis factoralpha tnfalpha gene expression protein secretion since tnfalpha increase interferon gamma ifngammadependent nitric oxide production studied whether lpl may synergize ifngamma induction macrophage production although ineffective lpl combination ifngamma increased largininedependent production dosedependent manner preincubation lpl antilpl neutralizing antibody totally suppressed effect increased synthetase no mrna expression also observed macrophage treatment ifngamma lpl protein synthesis required induction no mrna tnfalphamediated effect lpl no gene expression production observed ability lpl augment ifngammadependent no mrna expression associated increase no gene transcriptional activity no mrna stability finally binding nuclear protein nuclear factorkappa tnfalpharesponsive sequence macrophage no promotor decreased treatment cell ifngamma alone combination lpl data provide evidence link lpl arginine metabolism macrophage stress role lpl regulation macrophage activation

Isolation of the gene for cystic fibrosis (CF), the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), provided a basis for analyzing its molecular pathology and resulted in the identification of > 400 mutations associated with disease. Except for the delta F508 mutation, no other single mutation accounts for > 5% of CF chromosomes in most populations, and most mutation frequencies are < 1%. A strategy based on multiplex PCR followed by multiplex allele-specific oligonucleotide probe ligation was used to detect 30 mutations, distributed throughout ten exons and seven introns of the CFTR gene, that together account for > 96% of CF mutant chromosomes worldwide. Mutations were detected by competitive oligonucleotide probe ligation to detect normal and/or mutant genotypes in one reaction. Three probes (one common and two allelic probes) were needed for analysis of each mutation. Probes hybridized to target DNA were joined by a thermostable ligase if there were no mismatches at their junctions; temperature cycling resulted in a linear increase in product. Common probes were labeled with fluorochromes, and allelic probes each had different lengths. Ligation products were analyzed electrophoretically on a fluorescent DNA sequencer.

7538159,"Fluorescent liposomes as quantitative markers of phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages. A new phagocytic assay based on liposome ingestion by alveolar macrophages (AMs) is described. Fluorescent microspheres were encapsulated in liposomes, which allowed rapid enumeration by fluorometry. Liposomes made in the presence of vitronectin had the protein exposed on their outer surfaces, as determined by immunolabelling. Liposomes and rat AMs were incubated under conditions favorable for phagocytosis. Observation by light and electron microscopy showed AMs engulfing liposomes, with gradual transfer of fluorescent label from liposome to cell interior. This transfer was due to bona fide phagocytosis, as evidenced by (1) fluorescence of liposome-encapsulated dihydrofluorescein (DHF)-zymosan exclusively within AMs and (2) triggering of the respiratory burst by zymosan-associated liposomes only under conditions that allowed phagocytosis. Phagocytic activity was expressed as liposomes/cell, the average number of liposomes phagocytosed per macrophage.

7537697,"The E-cadherin complex contains the src substrate p120. Using normal MDCK cells, and MDCK cells stably transfected with a temperature-sensitive viral src allele (pp60 ts-v-src), we have examined the composition and tyrosine phosphorylation of the E-cadherin complex. E-cadherin is a transmembrane calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecule that is complexed with cytoplasmic proteins including alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, plakoglobin (gamma-catenin), and actin. We have identified two heterodimeric complexes which demonstrate that alpha-catenin interacts directly with beta-catenin, or with plakoglobin, in the absence of E-cadherin. beta-Catenin has previously been shown to bind directly to E-cadherin. We propose that E-cadherin associates with alpha-catenin, and thereby the actin cytoskeleton, via either beta-catenin or plakoglobin. We have further identified three new but related protein components of the E-cadherin complex, which are each cross-reactive by Western blot analysis to antibodies directed against p120, a phosphotyrosine substrate of src, and a phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, and phosphothreonine substrate of growth factor-stimulated signaling pathways. Greater quantities of the p120-related proteins were found present in the E-cadherin immunoprecipitates of ts-src MDCK cells compared to normal MDCK cells, while two of the p120 cross-reactive species were significantly tyrosine phosphorylated in both normal and ts-src MDCK cells. The association of p120-related species with the E-cadherin complex adds them to our consideration of possible modulators of cadherin function.

7537651,"Sensitivity of monoclonal antibodies to carcinoembryonic antigen, tissue polypeptide antigen, alpha-fetoprotein, carbohydrate antigen 50, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 in the diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma. This study was designed to establish the sensitivity of monoclonal antibodies to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA), carbohydrate antigen 50 (CA 50), and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) and the efficacy of the joint determination of several tumor markers, as well as the dynamics of postoperative normalization of each marker in the absence of recurrence. A prospective study was carried out in 100 patients subjected to surgical resection of colon adenocarcinoma. Serum concentrations of these markers were determined the day before surgery and seven days, two months, and six months after surgery. The results demonstrate that sensitivity increased as the disease spread and that CA 19-9 was the most sensitive tumor marker. The rate of false negatives was 40 percent for Dukes Stage A lesions, 19 percent for Dukes Stage B, 7 percent for Dukes Stage C, and 0 percent for Dukes Stage D. Determination of two markers (CA 19-9 and CEA) provided the greatest sensitivity in Stages A and D tumors (60 percent and 100 percent, respectively); the incidence did not change when measurements of other antigens were associated. For Stages B and C, determination of at least three markers was necessary, the association of CEA, TPA, and CA 19-9 being that which showed the greatest sensitivity, 78 percent and 91 percent, respectively.

7534640,"Cancer in developing countries. The developing countries are represented by incidence and mortality datasets from 16 populations. Trends are studied using age specific data from six cancer registries (three in Asia, three in Latin America) and national mortality datasets from Central and South America (three), the Caribbean (two), Asia (two) and Mauritius. In Africa, three cancer registries (in Nigeria, Uganda and Zimbabwe) provide time series of 15 years or more. Systematic examination of time trends is confined to five major sites (stomach, lung, breast, cervix uteri and colon-rectum), with a comment on observed trends in the other important cancers of developing countries (mouth/pharynx, oesophagus and liver). Although uniformity is not to be expected in such diverse material, some overall patterns emerge. Stomach cancer, as in the developed world, appears to be declining in importance. Lung cancer rates are rising, although in males, the increases are most marked in the elderly, with more recent birth cohorts in several populations showing a decline in risk. Breast cancer incidence and mortality rates are rising in most populations, with changes usually more marked in younger women. Conversely, cervix cancer, at present the most common cancer of women in developing countries, shows declines in incidence and mortality in the majority of populations studied, although Africa is clearly an exception.

7534634,"Thyroid cancer. Thyroid cancer is one of the rarest forms of cancer, and yet there are wide variations in the degree of malignancy, ranging from the most rapidly fatal to the relatively benign. This difference depends almost entirely on the histological type. A ""pool"" of individuals with occult thyroid carcinomas (in the vast majority of the papillary type) is probably present in most populations even at a young age. Large differences in the estimated frequency of cancer at this site can therefore be caused by variation in diagnostic intensity. Data on changing trends of incidence and mortality are thus subject to reservation, depending on the degree to which they have been influenced by changing diagnostic criteria and the precision of histopathological description. Nevertheless, there is evidence that mortality is slowly falling, whereas incidence is increasing, in several countries. This chapter considers the upward temporal trends of incidence and substantially stable mortality rates for thyroid carcinoma in the past three decades and attempts to interpret these trends in the light of concurrent changes in diagnostic standards and histological classification. Attention will also be drawn to the public health implications of the recent intensive detection and treatment of occult thyroid carcinomas.",Genome engineering,thyroid cancer thyroid cancer one rarest form cancer yet wide variation degree malignancy ranging rapidly fatal relatively benign difference depends almost entirely histological type pool individual occult thyroid carcinoma vast majority papillary type probably present population even young age large difference estimated frequency cancer site therefore caused variation diagnostic intensity data changing trend incidence mortality thus subject reservation depending degree influenced changing diagnostic criterion precision histopathological description nevertheless evidence mortality slowly falling whereas incidence increasing several country chapter considers upward temporal trend incidence substantially stable mortality rate thyroid carcinoma past three decade attempt interpret trend light concurrent change diagnostic standard histological classification attention also drawn public health implication recent intensive detection treatment occult thyroid carcinoma

7533470,"Cytoplasmic inclusions of astrocytic elements of glial tumors: special reference to round granulated body and eosinophilic hyaline droplets. Round granulated body (RGB) and eosinophilic hyaline droplets (EHDs) have been described as cytoplasmic inclusions of certain astrocytic tumors. In the previous literature, however, these inclusions have been described using various terms or regarded as nosologically the same entity. Light microscopically, RGB appeared as a round discrete body filled with fine uniform granules, while EHDs demonstrated a cluster of bright eosinophilic, round objects of various size. They could be clearly distinguished even by conventional histochemical staining such as the Masson trichrome stain and the phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin preparation. Both RGB and EHDs expressed positive immunoreactions for glial fibrillary acidic protein, several lysosomal markers, and some stress-response proteins. The ultrastructural appearances of these inclusions were distinct, however, one common feature was that they consisted of aggregations of numerous membrane-bound electron-dense bodies. Thus, both inclusions appear to be produced by neoplastic astrocytes and are possibly related to the lysosomal system. We examined the presence of RGB and EHDs in 138 astrocytic tumors. Both inclusions occurred most frequently in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, followed by gangliogliomas and pilocytic astrocytomas. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas exhibited only RGBs. RGBs and EHDs were not seen in any abundance in glioblastomas, gliosarcomas, fibrillary astrocytomas, protoplasmic astrocytomas, or oligo-astrocytomas. Some glioblastomas, however, showed only EHDs in small numbers. Several anaplastic astrocytomas were associated with a large number of RGBs and/or EHDs, and they revealed only rare mitosis despite marked cellular pleomorphism. Although RGB and EHDs have different morphological features, the presence of these inclusions in abundance may represent either a degenerative change, a long-standing lesion, or an indolent growth of the astrocytic tumors.",Genome engineering,cytoplasmic inclusion astrocytic element glial tumor special reference round granulated body eosinophilic hyaline droplet round granulated body rgb eosinophilic hyaline droplet ehds described cytoplasmic inclusion certain astrocytic tumor previous literature however inclusion described using various term regarded nosologically entity light microscopically rgb appeared round discrete body filled fine uniform granule ehds demonstrated cluster bright eosinophilic round object various size clearly distinguished even conventional histochemical staining masson trichrome stain phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin preparation rgb ehds expressed positive immunoreactions glial fibrillary acidic protein several lysosomal marker stressresponse protein ultrastructural appearance inclusion distinct however one common feature consisted aggregation numerous membranebound electrondense body thus inclusion appear produced neoplastic astrocyte possibly related lysosomal system examined presence rgb ehds astrocytic tumor inclusion occurred frequently pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas followed gangliogliomas pilocytic astrocytomas subependymal giant cell astrocytomas exhibited rgbs rgbs ehds seen abundance glioblastoma gliosarcomas fibrillary astrocytomas protoplasmic astrocytomas oligoastrocytomas glioblastoma however showed ehds small number several anaplastic astrocytomas associated large number rgbs andor ehds revealed rare mitosis despite marked cellular pleomorphism although rgb ehds different morphological feature presence inclusion abundance may represent either degenerative change longstanding lesion indolent growth astrocytic tumor

7533337,"Inhibition of platelet recruitment to arterial lesions by predeposition of platelets containing encapsulated iloprost. Drugs can be encapsulated within blood platelets by reversible electroporation and can be haemostatically targeted to vessel wall injury sites. Initial studies with iloprost-loaded pig platelets and pig aorta tunica media in perfusion circuits are presented. After autologous reconstitution into blood, no significant difference was observed in the deposition of 111Indium labelled sham-loaded and untreated platelets onto the tunica media during perfusion under low and high shear conditions. In paired experiments (n = 10 pairs), the deposition of iloprost-loaded platelets was significantly lower (mean 61%) after 5 min perfusion than the deposition from blood containing sham-loaded (control) platelets. A similar significant reduction (mean 54%) was seen after 10 min perfusion. Pre-perfusion of iloprost-loaded platelets for 10 min under low shear conditions (212/s), followed by 5 min perfusion of 111Indium labelled normal platelets, significantly reduced the secondary platelet deposition (p < 0.01) when compared with the deposition seen when control untreated platelets were preperfused. Significant differences (p < 0.001) in secondary deposition were also observed when primary and secondary platelet perfusions were made under high shear (1690/s). Histology of the tunica media segments post perfusion, supported the inhibitory effect of predeposited iloprost-loaded platelets on secondary platelet recruitment. By exploiting their natural haemostatic propensity, drug-loaded platelets can be targeted to vessel wall injury sites. Appropriate drugs could be packaged that may passivate the carrier platelets at the lesion inhibiting thrombus formation or they may act as a depot for sustained drug release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Genome engineering,inhibition platelet recruitment arterial lesion predeposition platelet containing encapsulated iloprost drug encapsulated within blood platelet reversible electroporation haemostatically targeted vessel wall injury site initial study iloprostloaded pig platelet pig aorta tunica medium perfusion circuit presented autologous reconstitution blood significant difference observed deposition indium labelled shamloaded untreated platelet onto tunica medium perfusion low high shear condition paired experiment pair deposition iloprostloaded platelet significantly lower mean min perfusion deposition blood containing shamloaded control platelet similar significant reduction mean seen min perfusion preperfusion iloprostloaded platelet min low shear condition followed min perfusion indium labelled normal platelet significantly reduced secondary platelet deposition compared deposition seen control untreated platelet preperfused significant difference secondary deposition also observed primary secondary platelet perfusion made high shear histology tunica medium segment post perfusion supported inhibitory effect predeposited iloprostloaded platelet secondary platelet recruitment exploiting natural haemostatic propensity drugloaded platelet targeted vessel wall injury site appropriate drug packaged may passivate carrier platelet lesion inhibiting thrombus formation may act depot sustained drug releaseabstract truncated word
7533294,"Src homology 2 domain as a specificity determinant in the c-Abl-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal repeated domain. The Src-homology (SH) 2 domain, found in a variety of proteins, has a binding site for phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. In adaptor proteins such as Grb2, the SH2 domain plays an important role in the assembly of signal transducer complexes. Many nonreceptor tyrosine kinases--e.g., Abl and Src--also contain SH2 domains. Without a functional SH2 domain, these tyrosine kinases retain catalytic activity but lose their biological function. This result suggests that the SH2 domain may be involved in the selection of biologically relevant substrates. We have previously shown that the carboxyl-terminal repeated domain (CTD) of the mammalian RNA polymerase II is a substrate for the Abl but not the Src tyrosine kinase. This specificity is conferred in part by the SH2 domain. The Abl SH2 domain binds the tyrosine-phosphorylated [Tyr(P)] CTD and is required for the processive and stoichiometric phosphorylation of the 52 tyrosines in the CTD. Mutation of the Abl SH2 or exchanging it with that of Src, which does not bind the Tyr(P)-CTD, abolished processivity and reduced the CTD kinase activity without any effect on autophosphorylation or the phosphorylation of nonspecific substrates. These results demonstrate that the SH2 domain of the Abl tyrosine kinase plays an active role in catalysis and suggests that SH2 domain and the tyrosine kinase domain may act in concert to confer substrate specificity.",Genome engineering,src homology domain specificity determinant cablmediated tyrosine phosphorylation rna polymerase ii carboxylterminal repeated domain srchomology sh domain found variety protein binding site phosphotyrosinecontaining peptide adaptor protein grb sh domain play important role assembly signal transducer complex many nonreceptor tyrosine kinaseseg abl srcalso contain sh domain without functional sh domain tyrosine kinase retain catalytic activity lose biological function result suggests sh domain may involved selection biologically relevant substrate previously shown carboxylterminal repeated domain ctd mammalian rna polymerase ii substrate abl src tyrosine kinase specificity conferred part sh domain abl sh domain bind tyrosinephosphorylated tyrp ctd required processive stoichiometric phosphorylation tyrosine ctd mutation abl sh exchanging src bind tyrpctd abolished processivity reduced ctd kinase activity without effect autophosphorylation phosphorylation nonspecific substrate result demonstrate sh domain abl tyrosine kinase play active role catalysis suggests sh domain tyrosine kinase domain may act concert confer substrate specificity
7533102,"Enhancement of human hematopoiesis by mast cell growth factor in human-sheep chimeras created by the in utero transplantation of human fetal hematopoietic cells. We have previously described a unique model of long-term, multilineage, human hematopoietic chimerism in sheep created by the in utero transplantation of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) into pre-immune fetal lambs. In this study, we examined the effect of chronic administration of recombinant human mast cell growth factor (rhMGF) on 1) human cell engraftment in pre-immune sheep and 2) human cell expression in human-sheep chimeras at 2-years posttransplant. rhMGF (25 micrograms/kg) or saline was administered in utero via chronic intraperitoneal (IP) catheters to three separate sets of twin fetuses on alternate days for 10 doses following transplantation of human HSC. Flow-cytometric and karyotype analyses of peripheral blood from two sets of twins at 45-days posttransplant and of peripheral blood from the remaining set of twins at birth revealed a significant increase in percentages of donor (human) progenitors and cells in rhMGF-treated lambs. rhMGF (60 micrograms/kg/day) was also administered by IP injection to two, 2 year-old, human-sheep chimeras for 18 consecutive days. Flow-cytometric analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow revealed a six- to seven-fold increase in human cell expression. The effect on early human progenitors (i.e., colony-forming unit-mix [CFU-Mix], CFU granulocyte/macrophage [CFU-GM], and burst-forming unit-erythroid [BFU-E]) was determined by karyotype analysis of individual colonies grown under conditions favoring human cell growth. A three- to five-fold increase in human CFU-Mix and BFU-E occurred with a minimal increase in CFU-GM. This in vivo study supports in vitro data suggesting that MGF is a powerful regulator of human hematopoiesis and preferentially stimulates early hematopoietic progenitors. It also supports the potential value of the human-sheep model for the in vivo study of normal and abnormal human hematopoiesis.",Genome engineering,enhancement human hematopoiesis mast cell growth factor humansheep chimera created utero transplantation human fetal hematopoietic cell previously described unique model longterm multilineage human hematopoietic chimerism sheep created utero transplantation human hematopoietic stem cell hsc preimmune fetal lamb study examined effect chronic administration recombinant human mast cell growth factor rhmgf human cell engraftment preimmune sheep human cell expression humansheep chimera year posttransplant rhmgf microgramskg saline administered utero via chronic intraperitoneal ip catheter three separate set twin fetus alternate day dos following transplantation human hsc flowcytometric karyotype analysis peripheral blood two set twin day posttransplant peripheral blood remaining set twin birth revealed significant increase percentage donor human progenitor cell rhmgftreated lamb rhmgf microgramskgday also administered ip injection two yearold humansheep chimera consecutive day flowcytometric analysis peripheral blood bone marrow revealed six sevenfold increase human cell expression effect early human progenitor ie colonyforming unitmix cfumix cfu granulocytemacrophage cfugm burstforming uniterythroid bfue determined karyotype analysis individual colony grown condition favoring human cell growth three fivefold increase human cfumix bfue occurred minimal increase cfugm vivo study support vitro data suggesting mgf powerful regulator human hematopoiesis preferentially stimulates early hematopoietic progenitor also support potential value humansheep model vivo study normal abnormal human hematopoiesis
7532729,"Lipid interference with fluorometric assay of DNA in adipose tissues under various conditions. Interference by lipids with fluorometric assay of DNA in adipose tissues using Hoechst 33258 was investigated. Mixed glycerides shifted the emission maximum of standard DNA and induced a dose-dependent increase in fluorescence intensity. Glycerides in the samples containing a known concentration of DNA yielded erroneously higher DNA concentrations. The DNA concentrations obtained from acetone-defatted white and brown adipose tissues (WAT and BAT) were lower than those of non-defatted ones, while DNA content did not differ in low lipid-containing skeletal muscle between defatted and non-defatted samples, indicating that large amounts of lipids interfere with DNA measurement using Hoechst 33258 and that acetone defatting is a simple method to avoid this interference. Using this defatting method, the cellularity of WAT and BAT was estimated in rats under various experimental conditions. Cold-acclimation and repetitive immobilization stress decreased the body weight gain and the epididymal WAT weight. Sucrose overfeeding increased WAT weight but not body weight.

Ribonuclease H is an endonuclease that hydrolyzes the RNA moiety of RNA-DNA duplex molecules. Escherichia coli ribonuclease H is involved in DNA replication, and retroviral ribonuclease H is essential for reverse transcription of the viral genome. To characterize the intramolecular dynamical properties of E. coli ribonuclease H, spin-lattice relaxation rate constants, spin-spin relaxation rate constants and steady state nuclear Overhauser effects for the 15N nuclear spins were measured by using proton-detected heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. The relaxation data were analyzed by using a series of dynamical models in conjunction with a statistical model selection protocol. Ribonuclease H exhibits a complex array of dynamical features, most notably in the parallel beta-strands of the principal five-stranded beta-sheet, the coiled-coil helical interface, the active site, and the loop regions surrounding the active site. The dynamical properties are correlated with local structural environments of the 15N spins and suggest possible relationships to the functional properties of ribonuclease H.

7526900,"Identification of residues in the monoclonal antitumor antibody L6 important for binding to its tumor antigen. L6 is a monoclonal antitumor antibody which recognizes an epitope located in a 42-residue extracellular domain of a tumor-associated approximately 22 kDa glycoprotein antigen. The L6 mAb localizes to solid tumors in vivo and triggers complement activation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. It has been the subject of phase I clinical trials. Previously, we had reported the derivation and analysis of a three-dimensional model of the L6 Fv. The model suggests that L6 displays a generally aromatic CDR surface. We aim at improving the affinity for tumor antigen of L6 by in vitro mutagenesis. As the first step toward this end, we have attempted to identify residues critical for the binding of L6 to tumor antigen. On the basis of the model, seven residues were selected which we thought may be critical for L6 antigen binding. Criteria for the selection of these residues were their accessibility and central position on the CDR surface and the residue character. Large polar or charged residues such as arginine, asparagine, and tyrosine were preferred. Nine site-specific single and double mutants were generated using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis in an M13 expression vector encoding the L6 Fab. The binding of these mutant Fabs to the L6 tumor antigen and a set of three anti-idiotypic antibodies was quantified in an ELISA. In eight out of nine mutants, binding to L6 tumor antigen was either abolished or substantially reduced. In contrast, the binding of the mutants to the anti-idiotypic antibodies was largely unaffected, suggesting that no significant structural perturbations were introduced as a consequence of these mutations.",Genome engineering,identification residue monoclonal antitumor antibody important binding tumor antigen monoclonal antitumor antibody recognizes epitope located residue extracellular domain tumorassociated approximately kda glycoprotein antigen mab localizes solid tumor vivo trigger complement activation antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity subject phase clinical trial previously reported derivation analysis threedimensional model fv model suggests display generally aromatic cdr surface aim improving affinity tumor antigen vitro mutagenesis first step toward end attempted identify residue critical binding tumor antigen basis model seven residue selected thought may critical antigen binding criterion selection residue accessibility central position cdr surface residue character large polar charged residue arginine asparagine tyrosine preferred nine sitespecific single double mutant generated using oligonucleotidedirected mutagenesis expression vector encoding fab binding mutant fabs tumor antigen set three antiidiotypic antibody quantified elisa eight nine mutant binding tumor antigen either abolished substantially reduced contrast binding mutant antiidiotypic antibody largely unaffected suggesting significant structural perturbation introduced consequence mutation

The MS2 coat protein achieves control of two distinct processes--sequence-specific RNA encapsidation and repression of replicase translation--by binding to an RNA stem-loop structure of 19 nucleotides containing the initiation codon of the replicase gene. The binding of a coat protein dimer to this hairpin shuts off synthesis of the viral replicase, switching the viral replication cycle to virion assembly rather than continued replication. The operator fragment alone can trigger self-assembly of the phage capsid at low protein concentrations and a complex of about 90 RNA operator fragments per protein capsid has been described.

Cytokine gene expression was analysed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of RNA from 27 human liver allograft specimens diagnosed as acute (n = 19) or chronic (n = 8) rejection and from 12 normal human livers. In initial screening experiments, mRNA for cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10 and gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) was expressed in all normal livers and almost all allograft specimens tested. IL-2 mRNA was expressed at barely detectable levels in four of 12 normal livers screened and in 20 of 26 liver allograft specimens with rejection. This constitutive expression of cytokine mRNA required semiquantitative PCR analysis to differentiate levels of cytokine mRNA expression between specimens. Titration of cDNA prior to PCR amplification was initially used and showed significantly more IL-2 (p = 0.02) and IFN-gamma (p = 0.03) in acute rejection compared to normal liver.

The net transfer of 125I-labelled insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I from the blood to the distal small intestine was measured in anaesthetized lambs using a non-recirculating vascular-perfused intestine. To determine whether IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) reduce net IGF transfer, radiolabelled IGF-I was compared with two analogues, des(1-3)IGF-I and LR3IGF-I, which show reduced affinity for IGFBPs. Radiolabelled IGF-I, des(1-3)IGF-I or LR3IGF-I (1 ng/ml plasma) was infused for 45 min into the arterial supply of a 10 cm intestinal segment, either in the absence of added unlabelled peptide (high specific activity) or in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabelled homologous peptide (low specific activity) to achieve different proportions of free and complexed peptide. Very little degradation of radiolabelled peptides was detected in plasma, with 3-10% degradation in the intestinal tissue. Less than 5% of radiolabelled IGF-I remained as free peptide in the efferent venous plasma of the perfused segment at both specific activities. Bound radiolabelled IGF-I was found by size-exclusion chromatography mainly in the 30-50 kDa region, with a smaller proportion in the 150 kDa peak. The net intestinal transfer of IGF-I, calculated as the sum of the proportions of infused tracer recovered from intestinal tissue, luminal contents and lymph, was 3.46 +/- 0.22% (S.E.M.) and 3.49 +/- 0.93% when infused at high and low specific activities respectively. The analogues differed from IGF-I with up to ninefold higher concentrations of free radiolabelled peptide in venous plasma of the perfused intestinal segment, and corresponding decreases in binding to the 30-50 kDa binding proteins. Notwithstanding these marked differences in the plasma levels of free peptide, net intestinal transfer was very similar for the three peptides, as was the extent of degradation in the intestinal tissue. The lack of correlation between binding to 30-50 kDa binding proteins and net intestinal transfer suggests that association with 30-50 kDa plasma binding proteins is not a rate-limiting determinant of net IGF transfer to intestinal tissue.",Genome engineering,transfer insulinlike growth factor igfi blood intestine comparison igfs bind poorly igfbinding protein net transfer ilabelled insulinlike growth factor igfi blood distal small intestine measured anaesthetized lamb using nonrecirculating vascularperfused intestine determine whether igfbinding protein igfbps reduce net igf transfer radiolabelled igfi compared two analogue desigfi lrigfi show reduced affinity igfbps radiolabelled igfi desigfi lrigfi ngml plasma infused min arterial supply cm intestinal segment either absence added unlabelled peptide high specific activity presence fold excess unlabelled homologous peptide low specific activity achieve different proportion free complexed peptide little degradation radiolabelled peptide detected plasma degradation intestinal tissue le radiolabelled igfi remained free peptide efferent venous plasma perfused segment specific activity bound radiolabelled igfi found sizeexclusion chromatography mainly kda region smaller proportion kda peak net intestinal transfer igfi calculated sum proportion infused tracer recovered intestinal tissue luminal content lymph sem infused high low specific activity respectively analogue differed igfi ninefold higher concentration free radiolabelled peptide venous plasma perfused intestinal segment corresponding decrease binding kda binding protein notwithstanding marked difference plasma level free peptide net intestinal transfer similar three peptide extent degradation intestinal tissue lack correlation binding kda binding protein net intestinal transfer suggests association kda plasma binding protein ratelimiting determinant net igf transfer intestinal tissue
7519272,"Human interleukin 1 beta: corticotropin releasing factor and ACTH release and gene expression in the male rat: in vivo and in vitro studies. Numerous studies have shown that interleukin 1 (IL1), a cytokine secreted by macrophages, is capable of stimulating the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Nevertheless, the sites involved in IL1 stimulation of the HPA axis remain, to date, subjects of controversy. In the present study, using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we tried to characterize the route by which IL1 acts on the HPA axis. In vivo, after an i.p. injection of human IL1 beta (1 microgram/rat), we measured plasma ACTH concentration, anterior pituitary (AP) ACTH content, hypothalamic (HT) corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) content, and also AP pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and HT CRF gene expression. ACTH and CRF were measured by specific radioimmunoassays (RIAs), and solution hybridization nuclease protection assay was used for quantification of nuclear POMC precursor RNA and nuclear and cytoplasmic POMC and CRF mRNA. Human IL1 beta provoked an increase in ACTH plasma concentration, a decrease in AP ACTH content, and a prolonged increase in AP POMC primary transcript levels (around 100%). A significant increase in AP POMC primary transcript content was evident 30 min after injection of hIL1 beta, while cytoplasmic POMC mRNA levels were increased in the AP only at 4 hr after injection of hIL1 beta. We did not observe an effect of hIL1 beta on either HT CRF content or HT CRF cytoplasmic mRNA levels. In order to characterize a possible direct effect of hIL1 beta at the AP level, we used an AP perifusion system to analyse the effect of hIL1 beta and CRH on ACTH release and on POMC gene expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Genome engineering,human interleukin beta corticotropin releasing factor acth release gene expression male rat vivo vitro study numerous study shown interleukin il cytokine secreted macrophage capable stimulating hypothalamopituitaryadrenal hpa axis nevertheless site involved il stimulation hpa axis remain date subject controversy present study using vivo vitro approach tried characterize route il act hpa axis vivo ip injection human il beta microgramrat measured plasma acth concentration anterior pituitary ap acth content hypothalamic ht corticotropin releasing factor crf content also ap proopiomelanocortin pomc ht crf gene expression acth crf measured specific radioimmunoassay rias solution hybridization nuclease protection assay used quantification nuclear pomc precursor rna nuclear cytoplasmic pomc crf mrna human il beta provoked increase acth plasma concentration decrease ap acth content prolonged increase ap pomc primary transcript level around significant increase ap pomc primary transcript content evident min injection hil beta cytoplasmic pomc mrna level increased ap hr injection hil beta observe effect hil beta either ht crf content ht crf cytoplasmic mrna level order characterize possible direct effect hil beta ap level used ap perifusion system analyse effect hil beta crh acth release pomc gene expressionabstract truncated word
7519223,"Efficacy of synthetic vaccines in the induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Comparison of the costimulating support provided by helper T cells and lipoamino acid. Synthetic vaccines that specifically induce active immunity mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are of great interest considering the central role of these cells in immune responses against intracellular antigens. The influence of specific T helper (Th) cell recruitment and of the potent immunostimulating lipoamino acid tripalmitoyl-S-glycerylcysteine (P3C) on CTL mediated immunity induced by CTL epitopes was analysed and compared. Synthetic peptides that represent CTL epitopes were found to be inefficient for CTL priming. However, when combined with peptides that contain Th cell epitopes, with proteins that carry multiple Th cell epitopes or with P3C, efficient priming of CTL was obtained. The costimulating support by P3C and proteins resulted in high cytolytic activities already after 9 days whereas, in the case of single helper epitopes, incubation periods of about 4 weeks were required. The effects of P3C and helper epitopes were additive.",Genome engineering,efficacy synthetic vaccine induction cytotoxic lymphocyte comparison costimulating support provided helper cell lipoamino acid synthetic vaccine specifically induce active immunity mediated cytotoxic lymphocyte ctl great interest considering central role cell immune response intracellular antigen influence specific helper th cell recruitment potent immunostimulating lipoamino acid tripalmitoylsglycerylcysteine pc ctl mediated immunity induced ctl epitope analysed compared synthetic peptide represent ctl epitope found inefficient ctl priming however combined peptide contain th cell epitope protein carry multiple th cell epitope pc efficient priming ctl obtained costimulating support pc protein resulted high cytolytic activity already day whereas case single helper epitope incubation period week required effect pc helper epitope additive
7504897,"Adhesion molecules in allergic inflammation. Allergic inflammation is characterized by recruitment of specific leukocyte subpopulations from blood into tissue and requires a series of cell adhesion-molecule-mediated interactions between postcapillary vascular endothelium and the leukocyte cell surface. Three major groups are involved: selectins, integrins, and the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. P- and E-selectin mediate initial leukocyte adhesion, whereas beta 2-integrin/ICAM-1 and VLA-4/VCAM-1 pathways mediate leukocyte arrest and transendothelial migration. Because VLA-4 expression is restricted to eosinophils and lymphocytes, VCAM-1 has been implicated in selective eosinophil recruitment characterizing allergic inflammation. However, additional factors such as profile of cytokine release are likely to operate since tissue eosinophilia has been observed in the absence of VCAM-1 expression. Recent use of monoclonal antibodies against functional epitopes on various cell adhesion molecules in animal models of extrinsic allergic asthma offers new possibilities in management of allergic disease.",Genome engineering,adhesion molecule allergic inflammation allergic inflammation characterized recruitment specific leukocyte subpopulation blood tissue requires series cell adhesionmoleculemediated interaction postcapillary vascular endothelium leukocyte cell surface three major group involved selectins integrins immunoglobulin gene superfamily eselectin mediate initial leukocyte adhesion whereas beta integrinicam vlavcam pathway mediate leukocyte arrest transendothelial migration vla expression restricted eosinophil lymphocyte vcam implicated selective eosinophil recruitment characterizing allergic inflammation however additional factor profile cytokine release likely operate since tissue eosinophilia observed absence vcam expression recent use monoclonal antibody functional epitope various cell adhesion molecule animal model extrinsic allergic asthma offer new possibility management allergic disease

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the effects of recombinant human growth hormone were studied on cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), monoamine metabolites, neuropeptides and endogenous opioid peptides. Twenty patients, 10 patients in each of 2 groups, with adult-onset, growth hormone deficiency were treated for 1 month with recombinant human growth hormone (0.25 U/kg/week) or placebo. All the patients received the appropriate thyroid, adrenal and gonadal hormone replacement.

7536632,"Constitutive alpha V beta 3 integrin-mediated adhesion of human lymphoid B cells to vitronectin substrate. Adherence to cells and matrices participates in lymphocyte migration and tissue localization and contributes to the regulation of growth and differentiation of the lymphoid cells. The adherence is mainly mediated by three families of cell-surface proteins: integrins, immunoglobulin (Ig)-related molecules, and selectins. Integrins recognize Ig-related molecules such as ICAMs as well as fibronectin (FN), vitronectin (VN), and other matrix proteins. In this study, the in vitro adhesive properties of two Epstein-Barr virus-carrying B lymphoblastoid cell lines, IB-4 and NAD-20, were compared. IB-4 cells grow as a monolayer in contrast to NAD-20 cells, which grow as cell clusters. IB-4 cells were found to adhere to the tissue culture vessel through a component of the fetal bovine serum. By using blocking monoclonal antibodies to cell-surface molecules and serum proteins, IB-4 cells were found to use alpha V beta 3 integrin (CD51/CD61) and serum VN as the adhesive molecules. alpha V beta 3 integrin also mediated adhesion of IB-4 cells to human serum VN and to purified VN and FN. This constitutive adherence was not enhanced by phorbol ester treatment and was inhibited by RGD-containing peptides, in contrast to the homotypic adhesion of NAD-20 cells, which was mediated by beta 2 integrin CD11a/CD18 and its ligand ICAM-1 (CD54).

7536210,"Massive weight loss restores 24-hour growth hormone release profiles and serum insulin-like growth factor-I levels in obese subjects. In the present study, we 1) determined whether the impaired spontaneous 24-h GH secretion as well as the blunted GH response to provocative testing in obese subjects are persistent disorders or transient defects reversed with weight loss and 2) investigated 24-h urinary GH excretion and basal levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), as well as insulin in obese subjects before and after a massive weight loss. We studied 18 obese subjects (age, 26 +/- 1 yr; body mass index, 40.9 +/- 1.1 kg/m2); 18 normal age-, and sex-matched control subjects; and 9 reduced weight obese subjects after a diet-induced average weight loss of 30.3 +/- 4.6 kg. Twenty-four-hour spontaneous GH secretion was estimated by obtaining 3240 integrated 20-min blood samples using a constant blood withdrawal technique and computerized algorithms. Body composition was determined using anthropometric measurements and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scanning (DXA). In the obese subjects, 24-h spontaneous GH release profiles and the GH responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and L-arginine as well as basal IGF-I levels and the IGF-I/IGFBP-3 molar ratio were decreased, whereas insulin levels were elevated compared to those in normal subjects. In obese subjects, 24-h spontaneous GH secretion and serum IGF-I levels were inversely related to abdominal fat (r = -0.67; P < 0.01) and percent body fat (r = -0.69; P < 0.01), respectively. The decreased 24-h spontaneous GH release profiles, the decreased GH responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and L-arginine, the decreased basal IGF-I levels and IGF-I/IGFBP-3 molar ratio, as well as the elevated insulin levels were returned to normal after a massive weight loss in the obese subjects. In conclusion, the present study has shown reversible defects in 24-h spontaneous GH release profiles, basal IGF-I levels, and the IGF-I/IGFBP-3 molar ratio in obese subjects.

7536200,"Concentrations, release, and disposal of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding proteins (IGFBP), IGF-I, and growth hormone in different vascular beds in patients with cirrhosis. The liver is thought to be the major source of circulating insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) and IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), whereas the primary production site of circulating IGFBP-3 remains unknown. As other tissues may contribute to the circulating pool of IGF-I and IGFBP, the aim of the present study was to assess the hepatic and renal arterio-venous difference and production rates of IGF-I, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-3, and GH in cirrhotic patients (n = 22) and matched control subjects (n = 27). IGFBP-1 and -3, IGF-I, and GH levels were measured by RIA in hepatic, renal, and peripheral veins and in the femoral artery. Levels of IGFBP-1 to -4 were additionally determined by Western ligand blotting. Hepatic venous IGFBP-1 was significantly increased in the cirrhotic patients (mean +/- SEM, 33.6 +/- 9.1 vs. 10.4 +/- 1.9 micrograms/L; P < 0.001), and arterio-renal-venous extraction was significant in both patients (6 +/- 2%; P < 0.01) and controls (11 +/- 1%; P < 0.001). Conversely, IGFBP-3 was decreased in the cirrhotic patients (1265 +/- 149 vs. 2712 +/- 137 micrograms/L; P < 0.001). IGFBP-3 correlated significantly with the wedged hepatic venous pressure (r = -0.49; P < 0.05), serum aspartate aminotransferase (r = -0.66; P < 0.01), serum bilirubin (r = -0.65; P < 0.01), serum albumin (r = 0.64; P < 0.01), and the Child score (r = -0.57; P < 0.01). IGF-I was significantly lower in the cirrhotics (57 +/- 10 vs. 143 +/- 11 micrograms/L; P < 0.001). No significant IGFBP-3 proteolysis was demonstrated in cirrhotics or controls. No significant differences were found in the values obtained simultaneously from hepatic, renal, and brachial veins or femoral artery, which suggests that no major net production or release of IGFBP-3 or IGF-I occurs in these tissues. No differences in IGFBP-2 or IGFBP-4 determined by Western ligan blot were found between patients and controls. The IGF-I concentrations correlated significantly with parameters of biochemical liver function. Basal GH concentrations were significantly higher in the cirrhotics (1.19 +/- 0.13 vs. 0.58 +/- 0.08 micrograms/L; P < 0.001).

7534821,"E2 and NS5: new antigens for detection of hepatitis C virus antibodies. The value of two new hepatitis C virus (HCV) antigens for detection of HCV antibodies was studied. These two recombinant antigens were derived from the nonstructural-5 (NS5) and envelope-2 (E2) region of the HCV genome. In a panel of 33 HCV-RNA positive samples with indeterminate Riba-2 confirmatory test results, 29 samples (88%) showed additional antibody reactivity against E2 and 12 samples (36%) showed additional reactivity against NS5. Among 39 HCV-RNA negative, Riba-2 indeterminate donor samples, no additional E2 or NS5 reactivity was found in 34 samples (87%); while 5 samples (13%) showed additional reactivity against NS5 and/or E2. E2 reactivity thus resolved the majority of hitherto indeterminate samples.

7533167,"Nevirapine alters the cleavage specificity of ribonuclease H of human immunodeficiency virus 1 reverse transcriptase. The action of the dipyridodiazepinone nevirapine (BI-RG-587) on polymerization and RNase H activities of human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (RT) was examined. Substrates using heteropolymeric DNA primers hybridized to complementary RNA templates were employed. Challenged assays were performed that allowed measurement of activity of the RT resulting from a single round of binding of RT to substrate. Results demonstrated that nevirapine alters the cleavage specificity of the RNase H. Instead of a primary cleavage approximately 18 nucleotides upstream of the DNA 3' terminus, multiple cleavages were observed ahead of and behind this site. This indicated that the compound facilitates sliding of the RT away from the DNA primer terminus allowing cleavage at more sites. The change in specificity occurred whether the primer terminus was at the end or internal on the template. Experiments with RNA primers on circular DNA demonstrated a nevirapine-induced stimulation of RNase H activity beyond the increase expected from the change in cleavage specificity. Examination of polymerization showed that the compound decreased both the number of primers that underwent synthesis and the processive elongation of those primers. The significance of these results with respect to viral replication and recombination is discussed.",Genome engineering,nevirapine alters cleavage specificity ribonuclease human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase action dipyridodiazepinone nevirapine birg polymerization rnase activity human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase rt examined substrate using heteropolymeric dna primer hybridized complementary rna template employed challenged assay performed allowed measurement activity rt resulting single round binding rt substrate result demonstrated nevirapine alters cleavage specificity rnase instead primary cleavage approximately nucleotide upstream dna terminus multiple cleavage observed ahead behind site indicated compound facilitates sliding rt away dna primer terminus allowing cleavage site change specificity occurred whether primer terminus end internal template experiment rna primer circular dna demonstrated nevirapineinduced stimulation rnase activity beyond increase expected change cleavage specificity examination polymerization showed compound decreased number primer underwent synthesis processive elongation primer significance result respect viral replication recombination discussed
7532566,"Markers for metastatic adenocarcinoma in serous effusion specimens. A variety of stains have been proposed as useful adjuncts to the morphologic diagnosis of serous effusion specimens. This study evaluates the sensitivity and specificity of nine stains for the detection of metastatic adenocarcinoma in effusions. Mucin cytochemistry with the Periodic acid-Schiff reaction after diastase digestion (PASd) and the mucicarmine method, as well as immunochemical staining for five glycoprotein antigens, was undertaken on 153 effusion specimens with histological and/or clinically confirmed diagnoses. Immunochemical stains included three antibodies to CEA (Dako polyclonal, 4E7 and A5B7) and antibodies to HEA (Ber-EP4), TAG 72 (B72.3), CD15 (LeuM1) and Epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) were evaluated. The sensitivity of the stains for adenocarcinoma (102 cases) was: PASd 37%; mucicarmine 24%; polyclonal anti-CEA 69%; 4E7 52%; A5B7 21%; EMA 91%; B72.3 44%; Ber-EP4 32%; LeuM1 24%. With the exception of EMA, none of the stains reacted with any cases of benign mesothelial cells (11 cases), reactive mesothelial cells (34 cases), or with six cases of mesothelioma. However, EMA staining was present in two cases (6%) of reactive mesothelial cells and all cases of mesothelioma. The optimal combination of stains for use in a panel was polyclonal anti-CEA/B72.3/PASd. Combined results from these three stains yielded a sensitivity of 83% for adenocarcinoma with no false positive results.

To evaluate the possibility that insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and their binding proteins (BPs) in bone play a role in regulating cortical bone formation in growing animals, we compared changes in IGF and IGF BP levels with changes in bone mineral density (BMD) at three different regions (proximal, middle, and distal) along the rabbit femoral shaft. BMD measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry decreased progressively from proximal to distal regions of the shaft, from 0.449 +/- 0.005 to 0.354 +/- 0.002 g/cm2 (mean +/- SEM; n = 9), respectively; total protein concentrations also decreased toward the distal region. We extracted the IGFs and their BPs from bone by demineralization in 10% EDTA and 4 M guanidine-HCl (pH 4.5). The IGFs were then separated from their BPs by size exclusion HPLC. The pH of the extraction buffer profoundly influenced the recoveries of the IGFs and, to a lesser extent, the total protein; at least 100% more IGFs were recovered at acid (4.5) pH than at neutral (7.5) or basic (10.5) pH.

The co-stimulatory B7 molecules (B7-1 and B7-2) are expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells in mice. In this study, we demonstrate that B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) are also expressed on murine T cells in the absence of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. The temporal expression of these two molecules on T cells varies with the state of activation where resting T cells express B7-2 but show little or no expression of B7-1. Following activation, B7-2 expression is down-regulated and there is a concomitant increase in the expression of B7-1 on the cell surface which peaks at about 72 h. Thus these two co-stimulatory molecules are reciprocally expressed on the T cell surface. This pattern of expression of B7-1 and B7-2 on T cells suggests that these two molecules may have different roles in the generation and regulation of immune responses.",Genome engineering,reciprocal expression costimulatory molecule murine cell following activation costimulatory molecule expressed professional antigenpresenting cell mouse study demonstrate cd cd also expressed murine cell absence major histocompatibility complex class ii molecule temporal expression two molecule cell varies state activation resting cell express show little expression following activation expression downregulated concomitant increase expression cell surface peak thus two costimulatory molecule reciprocally expressed cell surface pattern expression cell suggests two molecule may different role generation regulation immune response
7530344,"Muscarinic cholinergic stimulation of the nitric oxide-cyclic GMP signaling system in cultured rat sensory neurons. Acetylcholine or carbachol stimulated cyclic GMP production in neuronal cultures from embryonic rat dorsal root ganglia but not in non-neuronal dorsal root ganglia cultures. Acetylcholine stimulation of cyclic GMP production was mediated by muscarinic receptors and required extracellular Ca2+. Basal cyclic GMP production and acetylcholine-evoked cyclic GMP production were attenuated by Methylene Blue, suggesting the involvement of soluble guanylate cyclase and nitric oxide synthase. L-NG-Monomethyl arginine attenuated basal, acetylcholine or carbachol-stimulated cyclic GMP production; this inhibition of acetylcholine and carbachol stimulation of cyclic GMP was reversed by L-arginine. These results suggest that a nitrosyl factor mediates basal, as well as acetylcholine- and carbachol-stimulated, cyclic GMP production. Selective destruction of small diameter neurons by capsaicin pretreatment of dorsal root ganglion neuronal cultures abolished acetylcholine and capsaicin stimulation of cyclic GMP, but did not affect sodium nitroprusside stimulation of cyclic GMP. These results suggest that acetylcholine evoked production of a nitrosyl factor in capsaicin-sensitive (small diameter) sensory neurons, which subsequently stimulated a soluble guanylate cyclase and cyclic GMP production in adjacent neuronal and/or non-neuronal cells.

7526738,"Metal chelates as reversible stains for detection of electroblotted proteins: application to protein microsequencing and immunoblotting. Coomassie brilliant blue and Ponceau red have traditionally been used to stain electroblotted proteins, since they are compatible with existing N-terminal and internal protein microsequencing as well as with immunoblotting procedures. With recent improvements in sequencing and immunoblotting technology, detection of significantly smaller amounts of protein has become necessary. Metal complexes were evaluated as alternatives to conventional stains. Electroblotted proteins were detected by blocking nonspecific sites with polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 followed by incubation in metal chelate solutions at acidic pH values. Two of the most promising metal chelate stains were the Ferrozine/ferrous complex and the ferrocyanide/ferric complex. Both stained a wide variety of proteins and peptides quantitatively.

An artificial liver will be useful for the treatment of acute hepatic failure and a bridge of liver transplantation. The current reports suggest that the hybrid type of artificial liver composed of functional human liver cells and a bioreactor is practical for clinical use. In the present study, we succeeded high density culture on a large-scale of human functional hepatoma (JHH-7) using a newly developed radial flow packed-bed bioreactor. Since the shear stress of this bioreactor is lower than the other type, high density culture without cell damage is possible. JHH-7 cells produced large amounts of human albumin and other liver specific proteins, and then have the function of ammonia metabolism in the system.

7508748,"Amino acid sequence of human pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A derived from cloned cDNA. The amino acid sequence of human pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), a component of the circulating complex with the proform of eosinophil major basic protein (proMBP), has been determined from partial protein sequencing and from sequencing of cloned cDNA. The PAPP-A monomer contains 1547 amino acid residues, but is derived from a larger precursor of placental origin. PAPP-A contains 82 Cys residues, which are all bridged, 14 putative sites for N-glycosylation, and 7 putative sites for attachment of glycosaminoglycan groups. The C-terminal part of PAPP-A contains 5 approximately 60-residue motifs related to the short consensus repeats of complement proteins and selectins. The SCRs presently known can be grouped into three classes: complement-type, class I; selectin-type, class II; PAPP-A-type, class III. PAPP-A further contains three approximately 26-residue motifs, related to the lin-notch motifs of proteins regulating early tissue differentiation, and, in addition, a putative Zn2+ binding site similar to that found in many metalloproteinases has been identified.

7501866,"Epidemiology of atrazine. Chronically exposed workers in chemical plants have revealed no increased incidence of benign or malignant disease attributable to atrazine. Some case-control studies showed a slight increase of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) incidence while others were negative. Weighted evidence supports no causal association of malignant changes in farming populations with atrazine. Two studies on a rural population suggested an increase of ovarian tumors in exposed women. Neither statistics nor exposure data are satisfactory, however, and no other studies present supporting evidence. New studies under clearly defined conditions are desirable. Very high doses of atrazine ingested in suicidal attempts had no acute clinical effect, suggesting that atrazine is virtually innocuous to humans. Sporadic reports on suspected acute poisoning leave too many questions open to be convincing: they reflect coincidence rather than causality. The tolerance of ruminants to triazine is limited. Severe poisoning in case of accidental intake of concentrated products is to be expected. Poisoning through ingestion has been controlled with activated charcoal.

7530743,"The complex of FK506-binding protein 12 and FK506 inhibits calcineurin phosphatase activity and IgE activation-induced cytokine transcripts, but not exocytosis, in mouse mast cells. FK506 and cyclosporin A (CsA) are immunosuppressive agents that inhibit IL-2 production by activated T cells, but only CsA inhibits IgE activation-induced cytokine transcripts in mouse IL-3-dependent, bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC). We previously associated the resistance of BMMC to FK506 with a deficiency in the expression of FK506 binding protein (FKBP) 12, a molecule that forms a complex with FK506 capable of inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase activity in vitro. In this report, we establish that FKBP12 mediates FK506 inhibition of both calcineurin phosphatase activity and IgE activation-induced cytokine transcripts in a Kirsten murine sarcoma virus-immortalized mast cell line that is FKBP12 deficient. Overexpression of FKBP12 by transfection enhanced the ability of FK506 to inhibit calcineurin phosphatase activity (IC50 = 2 nM), compared with cells transfected with the expression vector alone (IC50 > 30 nM). The IC50 value for FK506 inhibition of IgE activation-induced transcripts for TNF-alpha decreased from 40 nM in vector control cells to 10 nM in FKBP12 transfectants. Similarly, the IC50 value for inhibition of IL-6 transcripts decreased from > 1000 nM in vector control cells to 35 nM in FKBP12 transfectants. In contrast, activation-elicited release of the secretory granule mediator beta-hexosaminidase was only partially inhibited by FK506 at 1000 nM, regardless of the levels of FKBP12 expressed by the cells. Thus, FKBP12 is the dominant cytosolic protein that mediates FK506 inhibition of TNF-alpha and IL-6 transcripts.",Genome engineering,complex fkbinding protein fk inhibits calcineurin phosphatase activity ige activationinduced cytokine transcript exocytosis mouse mast cell fk cyclosporin csa immunosuppressive agent inhibit il production activated cell csa inhibits ige activationinduced cytokine transcript mouse ildependent bone marrowderived mast cell bmmc previously associated resistance bmmc fk deficiency expression fk binding protein fkbp molecule form complex fk capable inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase activity vitro report establish fkbp mediates fk inhibition calcineurin phosphatase activity ige activationinduced cytokine transcript kirsten murine sarcoma virusimmortalized mast cell line fkbp deficient overexpression fkbp transfection enhanced ability fk inhibit calcineurin phosphatase activity ic nm compared cell transfected expression vector alone ic nm ic value fk inhibition ige activationinduced transcript tnfalpha decreased nm vector control cell nm fkbp transfectants similarly ic value inhibition il transcript decreased nm vector control cell nm fkbp transfectants contrast activationelicited release secretory granule mediator betahexosaminidase partially inhibited fk nm regardless level fkbp expressed cell thus fkbp dominant cytosolic protein mediates fk inhibition tnfalpha il transcript
7530672,"Correction of the cystic fibrosis defect by gene complementation in human intrahepatic biliary epithelial cell lines. Hepatobiliary disease is the second most common cause of mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). In the liver, only the intrahepatic biliary epithelial (IBE) cells express cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel. The aim of this study was to determine whether human CF-derived IBE cells can be infected with adenovirus and the CF phenotype complemented. IBE cells were isolated from 2 patients with CF and immortalized using retrovirus transduction of SV40 large T antigen. Immortalized cells were infected with the adenovirus vector Ad2/CFTR2 and assayed 2-31 days postinfection for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-induced halide efflux. Halide efflux was measured in single cells using fluorescence microscopy and the fluorescent probe 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)-quinolinium. CF-derived IBE cell lines express biliary specific markers and express no cAMP-inducible halide efflux. Following infection with the adenovirus vector Ad2/CFTR2, a cAMP-induced halide efflux was observed for 31 days, although the number of responsive cells decreased with time. Human CF-IBE cells can be infected by adenovirus and the defective CFTR complemented. The loss of responsive cells with time could be due to loss of construct and/or a reduced growth of cells that are overexpressing CFTR.

7529816,"Interaction of vitronectin with Pneumocystis carinii: evidence for binding via the heparin binding domain. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is a major opportunistic infection in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. P. carinii attachment to alveolar epithelial cells is considered necessary for growth and replication of the organism. Recent studies have focused on the role of adhesive proteins such as fibronectin and vitronectin in attachment mechanisms of P. carinii in the alveolar space. Whereas the role of fibronectin has been partially characterized, less is known about the mechanism of vitronectin interaction with P. carinii. To better understand the mechanism underlying this interaction, vitronectin-P. carinii binding was characterized with respect to monovalent and divalent cations and pH by using an iodine 125-labeled vitronectin binding assay to P. carinii. As an example, vitronectin-P. carinii binding was abolished in the presence of 1.0 mol/L NaCl and enhanced by Ca2+ and Mn2+. Further, periodate and heparin treatment of P. carinii significantly reduced vitronectin binding to the organism to 10% +/- 1.5% (p < 0.01) and 52% +/- 1.8% (p < 0.05) of control values, respectively. There was no competitive inhibition of vitronectin binding to P. carinii by using the peptide sequence arg-gly-asp-ser of the cell binding domain. The findings suggest that vitronectin, unlike fibronectin, binds to P. carinii by a predominantly electrostatic mechanism that likely involves the heparin binding domain of vitronectin.",Genome engineering,interaction vitronectin pneumocystis carinii evidence binding via heparin binding domain pneumocystis carinii pneumonia major opportunistic infection patient acquired immune deficiency syndrome carinii attachment alveolar epithelial cell considered necessary growth replication organism recent study focused role adhesive protein fibronectin vitronectin attachment mechanism carinii alveolar space whereas role fibronectin partially characterized le known mechanism vitronectin interaction carinii better understand mechanism underlying interaction vitronectinp carinii binding characterized respect monovalent divalent cation ph using iodine labeled vitronectin binding assay carinii example vitronectinp carinii binding abolished presence moll nacl enhanced ca mn periodate heparin treatment carinii significantly reduced vitronectin binding organism control value respectively competitive inhibition vitronectin binding carinii using peptide sequence argglyaspser cell binding domain finding suggest vitronectin unlike fibronectin bind carinii predominantly electrostatic mechanism likely involves heparin binding domain vitronectin

7529090,"Rubella surveillance to June 1994: third joint report from the PHLS and the National Congenital Rubella Surveillance Programme. A downward trend in the incidence of acquired rubella in England and Wales was reversed in 1993 when there were local outbreaks. These affected young adult males in particular, especially those living in college residences. Some spread to local antenatal populations occurred. Twenty-five confirmed infections were reported in pregnant women, most of whom were young and in their first pregnancy; this compares with totals of 12 and two in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Reports of congenital rubella have not risen since the 1993 outbreaks. Diagnosis lags behind birth, however, and further evaluation may be needed. Notifications of 14 infants, including one set of triplets, born with congenital infection since the beginning of 1991 have been received. Nine of the 12 mothers were immigrants, and three of these acquired their infection abroad. Data on antibody prevalence have revealed a large pool of susceptible males aged 10 to 25 years, which indicates that outbreaks in males would continue for some years if no action were taken. The national measles and rubella vaccination campaign in schools this month should abolish the difference in susceptibility between boys and girls up to 16 years of age and hasten progress towards the interruption of rubella transmission in the United Kingdom. Susceptibility in girls aged 13 to 14 years rose to 5.8% in 1993 from an average of 3.6% between 1986 and 1992.

7528719,"Characterization of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies directed against Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin. A panel of neutralizing murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin has been established, using formaline-inactivated alpha-toxin as an immunogen. Five independent groups of neutralizing epitopes have been identified representing five functionally important structures in the toxin molecule. Because none of the antibodies binds to overlapping decapeptides representing the toxin sequence or to bromocyanogen cleavage products of alpha-toxin, they may all bind to conformational epitopes. Nevertheless, they all bind to monomeric alpha-toxin in a Western blot. Three of the antibodies bind to the toxin monomer in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the presence, but not in the absence, of detergent. These epitopes are not accessible in hexameric toxin; two of them may represent the contact sites of the toxin monomers upon hexamerization and one is related to a structurally important glycine-rich central hinge region. Two different antibodies bind to monomeric toxin in an ELISA in the presence and absence of detergent and their epitopes are present more than once on oligomeric toxin; they bind strongly to hexameric toxin in a Western blot.

7523629,"Sodium/calcium exchange in rat cortical astrocytes. Regulation of the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) by an Na/Ca exchanger was studied in primary cultured rat cortical astrocytes. [Ca2+]cyt was measured by digital imaging in cells loaded with fura-2. The resting [Ca2+]cyt, approximately 150 nM, was only slightly increased by reducing the extracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]o) to 6.2 mM, or by treating the cells with ouabain for 15 min (to raise cytosolic Na+). Following treatment with ouabain, however, lowering [Na+]o caused [Ca2+]cyt to rise rapidly to approximately 1300 nM. When Ca2+ sequestration in intracellular stores was blocked by thapsigargin, lowering [Na+]o increased [Ca2+]cyt to approximately 1500 nM in the absence of ouabain. The low-[Na+]o-stimulated rise in [Ca2+]cyt was abolished by removal of external Ca2+, but was not blocked by the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil, or by caffeine or ryanodine, which deplete an intracellular Ca2+ store responsible for Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release. These data suggest that Na+ gradient reduction promotes net Ca2+ gain via Na/Ca exchange. Normally, however, a large rise in [Ca2+]cyt is prevented by sequestration of the entering Ca2+; this buffering of cytosolic Ca2+ can be circumvented by blocking sequestration with thapsigargin, or overwhelmed by enhancing net Ca2+ gain by pretreating the cells with ouabain. The presence of Na/Ca exchanger protein and mRNA in the astrocytes was confirmed by Western and Northern blot analyses, respectively. Immunohistochemistry revealed that exchanger molecules are distributed in a reticular pattern over the astrocyte surface. We suggest that the Na/Ca exchanger plays a role in regulating both [Ca2+]cyt and the intracellular stores of Ca2+ in astrocytes, and may thus contribute to the control of astrocyte responsiveness to neurotransmitters and neurotoxins.",Genome engineering,sodiumcalcium exchange rat cortical astrocyte regulation cytosolic free ca concentration cacyt naca exchanger studied primary cultured rat cortical astrocyte cacyt measured digital imaging cell loaded fura resting cacyt approximately nm slightly increased reducing extracellular na concentration nao mm treating cell ouabain min raise cytosolic na following treatment ouabain however lowering nao caused cacyt rise rapidly approximately nm ca sequestration intracellular store blocked thapsigargin lowering nao increased cacyt approximately nm absence ouabain lownaostimulated rise cacyt abolished removal external ca blocked ca channel blocker verapamil caffeine ryanodine deplete intracellular ca store responsible cainduced ca release data suggest na gradient reduction promotes net ca gain via naca exchange normally however large rise cacyt prevented sequestration entering ca buffering cytosolic ca circumvented blocking sequestration thapsigargin overwhelmed enhancing net ca gain pretreating cell ouabain presence naca exchanger protein mrna astrocyte confirmed western northern blot analysis respectively immunohistochemistry revealed exchanger molecule distributed reticular pattern astrocyte surface suggest naca exchanger play role regulating cacyt intracellular store ca astrocyte may thus contribute control astrocyte responsiveness neurotransmitter neurotoxin

The polyclonal nature of antimitochondrial autoantibodies and the limited success of generating human monoclonal antibodies have made analysis of fine specificity and antibody heterogeneity difficult to define. The major autoantigen of primary biliary cirrhosis is the E2 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase pathway (PDC-E2). To address the relative importance of the region(s) in the PDC-E2 inner lipoyl domain to antibody binding, we report herein detailed profiles of 12 PDC-E2-specific antigen-binding fragments, SP1 through SP12, derived by screening of a combinatorial immunoglobulin library (derived from a primary biliary cirrhosis patient) with full-length native PDC-E2. All antigen-binding fragments are IgG isotypes and include a similar number of lambda- and kappa-chains. The antigen-binding fragments react specifically to PDC-E2 with high affinity (kappa a = 10(-7) to 10(-10) mol/L-1) and recognize a conformational epitope in the inner lipoyl domain of PDC-E2. Furthermore, the antibodies demonstrate substantial heterogeneity in recognition of different recombinant PDC-E2 fragments and differential recognition patterns against mutant constructs of the human PDC-E2 inner lipoyl domain (amino acid residues 91 to 227). In addition, five of the antigen-binding fragment clones (SP1, 3, 4, 8 and 12) demonstrate different staining patterns on biliary epithelial cells of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis but not control liver disease; some antigen-binding fragments specifically stained the apical region of biliary epithelium, a pattern distinct from that of typical mitochondrial staining. The response to the inner lipoyl domain is not, however, monospecific, and there is much more heterogeneity in fine specificity than could be accounted for by arbitrary reshuffling of variable immunoglobulin heavy and light chains into unnatural combinations.",Genome engineering,heterogeneity combinatorial human autoantibody pdce biliary epithelial cell patient primary biliary cirrhosis polyclonal nature antimitochondrial autoantibody limited success generating human monoclonal antibody made analysis fine specificity antibody heterogeneity difficult define major autoantigen primary biliary cirrhosis component pyruvate dehydrogenase pathway pdce address relative importance region pdce inner lipoyl domain antibody binding report herein detailed profile pdcespecific antigenbinding fragment sp sp derived screening combinatorial immunoglobulin library derived primary biliary cirrhosis patient fulllength native pdce antigenbinding fragment igg isotypes include similar number lambda kappachains antigenbinding fragment react specifically pdce high affinity kappa moll recognize conformational epitope inner lipoyl domain pdce furthermore antibody demonstrate substantial heterogeneity recognition different recombinant pdce fragment differential recognition pattern mutant construct human pdce inner lipoyl domain amino acid residue addition five antigenbinding fragment clone sp demonstrate different staining pattern biliary epithelial cell patient primary biliary cirrhosis control liver disease antigenbinding fragment specifically stained apical region biliary epithelium pattern distinct typical mitochondrial staining response inner lipoyl domain however monospecific much heterogeneity fine specificity accounted arbitrary reshuffling variable immunoglobulin heavy light chain unnatural combination

7519984,"The stabilizing effects of hydrophobic cores on peptide folding of bovine-pancreatic-trypsin-inhibitor folding-intermediate model. A synthetic peptide model composed of alpha-helical and beta-sheet portions (P alpha P beta) is a crucial folding intermediate in the folding of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), which contains 30 amino acid residues, and provides a good model for studying the folding structure. Using this model the roles of hydrophobic cores, such as non-polar amino acids and a short beta strand, in the folding structure stability were investigated by deleting the hydrophobic amino acids or substituting with Ala. As a first step, a mutant peptide, P alpha 6 P beta 1, was made by removing the four residues (NNFK46) from the N-terminus of P alpha which make a short beta strand in native BPTI, and each of the hydrophobic cores, Phe45 of P alpha and Tyr21 of P beta, were substituted by Ala. Without the short beta strand the peptide still folds in spite of its low solubility, suggesting that a simple alpha helix and central antiparallel beta sheet contain sufficient information to direct the folding of this region of molecule. The peptide without Tyr21 was much more unstable than P alpha 6 P beta 1, such that most of the folding structure collapsed even at 0 degree C, whereas without Phe45 the structure was more stable than P alpha 6 P beta 1. This indicates that the hydrophobic interactions of Tyr21 in P beta are more important in BPTI folding.",Genome engineering,stabilizing effect hydrophobic core peptide folding bovinepancreatictrypsininhibitor foldingintermediate model synthetic peptide model composed alphahelical betasheet portion alpha beta crucial folding intermediate folding bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor bpti contains amino acid residue provides good model studying folding structure using model role hydrophobic core nonpolar amino acid short beta strand folding structure stability investigated deleting hydrophobic amino acid substituting ala first step mutant peptide alpha beta made removing four residue nnfk nterminus alpha make short beta strand native bpti hydrophobic core phe alpha tyr beta substituted ala without short beta strand peptide still fold spite low solubility suggesting simple alpha helix central antiparallel beta sheet contain sufficient information direct folding region molecule peptide without tyr much unstable alpha beta folding structure collapsed even degree whereas without phe structure stable alpha beta indicates hydrophobic interaction tyr beta important bpti folding
7517362,"T cell receptor stimulation, but not CD28 costimulation, is dependent on LFA-1-mediated events. Accessory molecules play a crucial role in the development of the T cell response to antigenic challenge. In this manuscript we specifically examine the role of two accessory molecules, CD28 and LFA-1, in modulating the T cell proliferative response to a variety of stimuli. We demonstrate that the proliferation induced by staphylococcal enterotoxins A and B in combination with CD28 costimulation is dependent on LFA-1-mediated events. This requirement for LFA-1 is independent of T cell-accessory cell adhesion. Similarly, an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction, which has previously been shown to be a CD28-dependent response, can be inhibited by blockade of LFA-1. This suggests LFA-1 plays an essential role in these responses, either by enhancing intercellular adhesion or by an independent signal transduction event. In contrast, when the primary activating stimulus is delivered by immobilized anti-CD3 antibody or by PMA, and the secondary stimulus by either alpha-CD28 or cell-bound CD28 ligand B7, there is no requirement for LFA-1. In addition, we demonstrate that cross-linking of LFA-1 with immobilized monoclonal antibody, or engagement of LFA-1 with ICAM-1 expressed on the surface of a CHO cell, provide an insufficient costimulus for T cell proliferation initiated by enterotoxin, immobilized alpha-CD3 or phorbol ester. Our data suggests that LFA-1, in contrast to CD28, functions not as a costimulatory molecule, but serves primarily to modulate the signal delivered through the T cell receptor.",Genome engineering,cell receptor stimulation cd costimulation dependent lfamediated event accessory molecule play crucial role development cell response antigenic challenge manuscript specifically examine role two accessory molecule cd lfa modulating cell proliferative response variety stimulus demonstrate proliferation induced staphylococcal enterotoxin combination cd costimulation dependent lfamediated event requirement lfa independent cellaccessory cell adhesion similarly allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction previously shown cddependent response inhibited blockade lfa suggests lfa play essential role response either enhancing intercellular adhesion independent signal transduction event contrast primary activating stimulus delivered immobilized anticd antibody pma secondary stimulus either alphacd cellbound cd ligand requirement lfa addition demonstrate crosslinking lfa immobilized monoclonal antibody engagement lfa icam expressed surface cho cell provide insufficient costimulus cell proliferation initiated enterotoxin immobilized alphacd phorbol ester data suggests lfa contrast cd function costimulatory molecule serf primarily modulate signal delivered cell receptor
7516281,"A field study of environmental impacts at a bleached kraft pulp mill site on the Baltic Sea coast. The rate of technical development in bleaching of chemical pulp and the upgrading of process control and wastewater treatment systems in the pulp industry have been extremely rapid over the past few years. When assessing the environmental impacts of bleached kraft pulp mill effluents (BKMEs), it is therefore more important than ever to carefully characterize the bleaching process, the composition of the treated effluent, and the degree of exposure of sensitive target organisms in the receiving water body. These requirements have not always been fulfilled in previous reports on biological effects of BKMEs in Scandinavia. This work presents the results of a comprehensive field study of the impacts of a 350,000-tonne kraft mill, bleaching softwood and hardwood pulp in campaigns according to the sequence O(D25,C70+D5)(EOP)D(EP)D. The effluent is treated in an aerated lagoon with a mean retention time of 8-9 days, practically eliminating chlorate and resin acids, and reducing the discharge of adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) to an average of 1 t/day (1.3 and 0.4 kg/ADt for softwood and hardwood, respectively). The treated effluent is discharged through a 1.3-km-long diffuser, at a water depth of 9-12 m, into a well ventilated coastal area, giving a 1000-fold dilution within 3-4 km from the diffuser. The actual exposure of the coastal ecosystem to BKME components was determined by analysis of extractable organic chlorine in suspended solids and of conjugates of chlorophenolics in the bile of feral perch. Despite a major damage to the benthic communities that occurred about 10 years ago, and was due to large chlorate discharges at the time, no direct detrimental effects on benthic flora and fauna could be ascribed to the present BKME discharge. Instead, a clear recovery of the Fucus community, although not yet completed, could be demonstrated. Studies of the composition, abundance and biomass of the fish community, the recruitment and survival of fish fry, and the physiological status of perch, using a set of biomarkers, revealed that even in the most BKME-exposed area, only minor effects were detected. These effects were related to eutrophication/enrichment rather than to the action of toxic substances. The general effect picture, thus, was essentially of a different type than the one recorded in previous studies of mills, which used older technology and less effective process and effluent treatment control, and which were discharging into enclosed, shallow bays of the Baltic Sea.",Genome engineering,field study environmental impact bleached kraft pulp mill site baltic sea coast rate technical development bleaching chemical pulp upgrading process control wastewater treatment system pulp industry extremely rapid past year assessing environmental impact bleached kraft pulp mill effluent bkmes therefore important ever carefully characterize bleaching process composition treated effluent degree exposure sensitive target organism receiving water body requirement always fulfilled previous report biological effect bkmes scandinavia work present result comprehensive field study impact tonne kraft mill bleaching softwood hardwood pulp campaign according sequence odcdeopdepd effluent treated aerated lagoon mean retention time day practically eliminating chlorate resin acid reducing discharge adsorbable organic halogen aox average tday kgadt softwood hardwood respectively treated effluent discharged kmlong diffuser water depth well ventilated coastal area giving fold dilution within km diffuser actual exposure coastal ecosystem bkme component determined analysis extractable organic chlorine suspended solid conjugate chlorophenolics bile feral perch despite major damage benthic community occurred year ago due large chlorate discharge time direct detrimental effect benthic flora fauna ascribed present bkme discharge instead clear recovery fucus community although yet completed demonstrated study composition abundance biomass fish community recruitment survival fish fry physiological status perch using set biomarkers revealed even bkmeexposed area minor effect detected effect related eutrophicationenrichment rather action toxic substance general effect picture thus essentially different type one recorded previous study mill used older technology le effective process effluent treatment control discharging enclosed shallow bay baltic sea
7516254,"Involvement of neurokinins in the non-cholinergic response to activation of 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors in guinea-pig ileum. 1. The involvement of neurokinins in the non-cholinergically-mediated contractile response induced by stimulation of 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors has been examined in the longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus preparation of the guinea-pig ileum. 2. The 5-HT3 receptor agonist, 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (2-methyl-5-HT), showed a lower potency in this preparation than the more selective 5-HT4 receptor agonist 5-methoxytryptamine. The effect of both drugs was markedly reduced by atropine. 3. Substance P (SP) and neurokinin B (NKB) produced biphasic concentration-response curves in the preparation. Neurokinin A (NKA), the NK1 receptor agonist, [Sar9,Met(O2)11]SP and the NK3 receptor agonist, senktide yielded monophasic concentration-response curves. 4. After desensitization of the NK1 receptor with SP or [Sar9,met(O2)11]SP, in the presence of atropine, the contractile response to 2-methyl-5-HT was entirely blocked. Desensitization of NK3 receptors with NKB, also in the presence of atropine, fully suppressed the 5-HT4 receptor-mediated contraction evoked by 5-methoxytryptamine. 5. In preparations prelabelled with [3H]-choline, SP produced a concentration-dependent increase in tritium overflow, an index of [3H]-acetylcholine release, while an inverse relationship was found with NKB. At low neurokinin concentrations, the releasing effect of NKB was much more marked. 6. It is suggested that in the response to 5-HT3 receptor stimulation, there is a role for SP and acetylcholine. NKB appears to be preferentially involved in the release of acetylcholine elicited by stimulation of 5-HT4 receptors.",Genome engineering,involvement neurokinins noncholinergic response activation ht ht receptor guineapig ileum involvement neurokinins noncholinergicallymediated contractile response induced stimulation ht ht receptor examined longitudinal musclemyenteric plexus preparation guineapig ileum ht receptor agonist methylhydroxytryptamine methylht showed lower potency preparation selective ht receptor agonist methoxytryptamine effect drug markedly reduced atropine substance sp neurokinin nkb produced biphasic concentrationresponse curve preparation neurokinin nka nk receptor agonist sarmetosp nk receptor agonist senktide yielded monophasic concentrationresponse curve desensitization nk receptor sp sarmetosp presence atropine contractile response methylht entirely blocked desensitization nk receptor nkb also presence atropine fully suppressed ht receptormediated contraction evoked methoxytryptamine preparation prelabelled hcholine sp produced concentrationdependent increase tritium overflow index hacetylcholine release inverse relationship found nkb low neurokinin concentration releasing effect nkb much marked suggested response ht receptor stimulation role sp acetylcholine nkb appears preferentially involved release acetylcholine elicited stimulation ht receptor
7516179,"Voltage-gated currents of rabbit A- and B-type horizontal cells in retinal monolayer cultures. In monolayer cultures prepared from immature early postnatal rabbit retina, small populations of neurons can be demonstrated to differentiate into apparently mature A- and B-type horizontal cells. Using whole-cell, single-channel, patch-clamp recording techniques, we have analyzed the pattern of voltage-gated conductances expressed by mammalian horizontal cells under these conditions. A total of six different voltage-dependent ionic currents were recorded. Tetrodotoxin-sensitive fast sodium inward currents (INa) were found in 81% of the A-type and 90% of the B-type cells. Inward calcium currents could be demonstrated in all cells tested after blockade of other conductances. Two types of outward potassium currents with properties of the 4-aminopyridine-sensitive transient IA and the tetraethylammonium sensitive delayed rectifier IK, respectively, could be characterized in whole-cell recordings. An inward rectifying potassium current (Ianom) typical for horizontal cells was activated in response to hyperpolarizing voltage steps. These types of currents have also been described in dissociated adult horizontal cells from lower vertebrates and cat. With single-channel recordings on inside-out patches excised from B-type cells, an additional Ca(2+)-dependent current (IK(Ca)) was observed which, so far, has not been described in horizontal cells developing in situ.

We have measured its concentration and those of alpha 2-macroglobulin, IgG and albumin in the CSF of 51 patients with AD and 50 healthy and disease control subjects. The mean levels of SAP were 12.8 ng/ml in AD and 8.5 ng/ml in controls (P < 0.0125); there was no difference in the levels of the other proteins studied. The observed concentrations of SAP were much lower than expected for a protein of molecular weight 254620.

7511771,"The relative contributions of transcription and translation to plasmid DNA supercoiling in Salmonella typhimurium. Mutations affecting DNA topoisomerase I (topA) in Salmonella typhimurium were isolated and graded on the basis of their ability to reverse the effects of gyrB mutations on his operon expression. Different topA and gyrB alleles (in otherwise isogenic strains) were used to gather insights into the transcription-dependent variability of plasmid DNA-linking deficit in growing bacteria. This study showed that modulation of DNA supercoiling by transcription results from the action of two components: one is highly dependent on the coupling of translation to RNA-chain elongation; and the other is unrelated to protein synthesis and entirely dependent on promoter determinants. The former greatly predominates in DNA topoisomerase I mutants (topA and topA gyrB) while the latter is the sole contributor to plasmid DNA-linking deficit in wild-type cells. Altogether, these data suggest that whereas translation acts by enhancing the formation of twin supercoiled domains during elongation, the promoter-dependent effects bear no relation to the twin-supercoiled-domain model and are better explained by a mechanism which responds to the binding/unwinding of template DNA by RNA polymerase.",Genome engineering,relative contribution transcription translation plasmid dna supercoiling salmonella typhimurium mutation affecting dna topoisomerase topa salmonella typhimurium isolated graded basis ability reverse effect gyrb mutation operon expression different topa gyrb allele otherwise isogenic strain used gather insight transcriptiondependent variability plasmid dnalinking deficit growing bacteria study showed modulation dna supercoiling transcription result action two component one highly dependent coupling translation rnachain elongation unrelated protein synthesis entirely dependent promoter determinant former greatly predominates dna topoisomerase mutant topa topa gyrb latter sole contributor plasmid dnalinking deficit wildtype cell altogether data suggest whereas translation act enhancing formation twin supercoiled domain elongation promoterdependent effect bear relation twinsupercoileddomain model better explained mechanism responds bindingunwinding template dna rna polymerase

C3H/HeN mice inoculated intravenously with either 2.25 x 10(3) or 2.25 x 10(5) Rickettsia conorii (Malish 7 strain) were observed for illness with sacrifice of animals for evaluation of pathologic lesions and host responses by light and electron microscopy, rickettsial content and location by plaque assay, immunohistology, and electron microscopy, and immune response by cytokine analyses and serology. Mice inoculated with a high dose of rickettsiae established disseminated endothelial infection on day 1, became ill with progressive increase in rickettsiae on day 4, and died with vascular injury-based meningoencephalitis and interstitial pneumonia on day 5 or 6. Mice inoculated with the low rickettsial dose became ill on day 5 and recovered by day 10. Clearance of rickettsiae was associated with lymphohistiocytic perivasculitis.

7511584,"Tinkering with transporters: periplasmic binding protein-dependent maltose transport in E. coli. Periplasmic binding protein-dependent transport systems represent a common mechanism for nutrient and ion uptake in bacteria. As a group, these systems are related to one another and to other transporters of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, based on sequence similarity within an ATP-binding subunit and overall structural organization. These transporters probably all use energy derived from ATP to pump substrates across membranes. Although there is considerable information about the sequences and identity of the transporters, there is little information about how they work. That is, where do ligands bind? Where do the subunits or domains interact with one another? How is the energy of nucleotide binding and/or hydrolysis converted to conformational changes? In order to address these questions we have taken a genetic approach that involves studying mutant forms of a transporter. Rather than study mutations that result in complete loss of function, the study of mutations which perturb or alter the normal function of the transporter in a defined manner has provided a limited insight into how the answers to these questions may be obtained.",Genome engineering,tinkering transporter periplasmic binding proteindependent maltose transport coli periplasmic binding proteindependent transport system represent common mechanism nutrient ion uptake bacteria group system related one another transporter prokaryote eukaryote based sequence similarity within atpbinding subunit overall structural organization transporter probably use energy derived atp pump substrate across membrane although considerable information sequence identity transporter little information work ligand bind subunit domain interact one another energy nucleotide binding andor hydrolysis converted conformational change order address question taken genetic approach involves studying mutant form transporter rather study mutation result complete loss function study mutation perturb alter normal function transporter defined manner provided limited insight answer question may obtained
7511531,"Control of cellular iron homeostasis by iron-responsive elements in vivo. It has recently been proposed that cellular iron homeostasis in mammalian cells is regulated at the post-transcriptional level by the reciprocal control of transferrin receptor and ferritin mRNA expression via an iron-regulatory factor. This iron-regulatory factor has been shown to be a cytoplasmic aconitase which can bind to iron-responsive elements in the corresponding mRNAs with greater or lesser affinity as a function of the iron status of the cell. In the present study, we show that in vivo the affinity of iron-regulatory factor for iron-responsive elements in liver reflects the long-term iron status of the tissue in animal models for iron overloading and iron deficiency, when combined with altered transferrin saturation and serum iron levels. In contrast hepatic iron overload achieved without altering such haematopoeitic indices, had a less pronounced effect. In both spleen and heart, the affinities of iron-regulatory factor changed in parallel with both altered iron status and haematological markers.

The X-gene product of human hepatitis B virus is a transacting transcriptional factor which activates a variety of heterologous viral and host promoters/enhancers. We have found that the X-gene product can significantly transactivate the regulatory sequences located at the 5'-upstream of the c-jun oncogene when a reporter plasmid containing the sequences was co-transfected to HepG2 cells with an X-gene expression plasmid. The results of mutational analysis indicate that the X-gene activation requires the AP-1 sequence of the c-jun gene. Furthermore, we also found that the X-gene is capable of activating the 5'-upstream sequence of the alpha-fetoprotein gene. There are at least two elements that respond to the X-gene transactivation. One is located in the sequences between -5,100 and -2,900, and the other is at the C/EBP site. Therefore, the X-gene activates the c-jun and alpha-fetoprotein genes through different host factors, namely AP-1 and C/EBP, respectively.

The albumin multigene family encodes proteins synthesized in the liver and secreted in the serum to fulfill ligand-carrier functions. The albumin (ALB), alpha 1-fetoprotein (AFP), and vitamin D-binding protein genes are syntenic, the ALB and AFP genes are organized in tandem, and the AFP gene is selectively expressed in the fetal liver. We now report the existence of a fourth member of the albumin gene family, located 10 kilobases downstream from the AFP locus. The new gene, named alpha-albumin (alpha ALB), is selectively expressed in the liver at late stages of development. The alpha ALB mRNA sequence encodes a predicted secreted protein with the typical triple domain disulfide cross-linked structure.

7509483,"The proliferative function of basal cells in the normal and hyperplastic human prostate. To obtain more insight into the proliferative function of basal and secretory cell types in human prostate, we studied the immunoprofile of three well-characterized proliferation-associated antigens (Ki-67, PCNA, MIB 1) in normal and hyperplastic prostate tissue. Distinction between labeled basal and secretory cell types was made by simultaneous demonstration of the proliferation-associated antigens and basal cell-specific cytokeratins in identical sections. In normal and hyperplastic acini, approximately 70% of labeled cells were of the basal cell phenotype. These data clearly suggest that the proliferative compartment of the normal and hyperplastic epithelium is located in the basal cell layer. Compared to normal and hyperplastic conditions, severe proliferative abnormalities were detected in high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasias (PIN), as documented by the extension of the proliferative compartment up to the luminal border. Conversely, approximately 70% of proliferating cells detected in atypical hyperplasias that progressed in invasive carcinomas were localized in the remaining basal cell layer. These findings may indicate the proliferative role of basal cells in the epithelial renewal, and the development of hyperplastic and neoplastic disorders in the human prostate.",Genome engineering,proliferative function basal cell normal hyperplastic human prostate obtain insight proliferative function basal secretory cell type human prostate studied immunoprofile three wellcharacterized proliferationassociated antigen ki pcna mib normal hyperplastic prostate tissue distinction labeled basal secretory cell type made simultaneous demonstration proliferationassociated antigen basal cellspecific cytokeratins identical section normal hyperplastic acinus approximately labeled cell basal cell phenotype data clearly suggest proliferative compartment normal hyperplastic epithelium located basal cell layer compared normal hyperplastic condition severe proliferative abnormality detected highgrade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia pin documented extension proliferative compartment luminal border conversely approximately proliferating cell detected atypical hyperplasia progressed invasive carcinoma localized remaining basal cell layer finding may indicate proliferative role basal cell epithelial renewal development hyperplastic neoplastic disorder human prostate

The interpretation of metal levels in hair is difficult because of the risk of external contamination. The aim of this study was to define the degree of external contamination of hair exposed in vitro to mercury vapor. Specimens of hair were exposed to concentration: 0.026, 0.21, and 2.7 mg Hg/m3 for 2-28 d. Mercury levels in hair increased during 28 d of exposure 2, 3 and 13, times, respectively, when compared to initial values. Mercury levels in hair exposed to the first and second (but not third) concentration of mercury vapor attained a steady state on the 21st d of exposure. The contamination of hair with mercury could not be removed by washing with water, solvent, and detergent.

7509140,"Organ-specific autoantigens induce transforming growth factor-beta mRNA expression in mononuclear cells in multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by patchy accumulations of inflammatory cells combined with demyelination. There are mononuclear cells in blood and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with MS that produce interferon-gamma and interleukin-4 in response to myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP). Here we describe autoantigen-induced production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). This multifunctional cytokine has inhibitory effects on the growth, differentiation, and effector functions of activated T cells. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid cells were exposed in short-term cultures to MBP and PLP and, after hybridization with complementary DNA oligonucleotide probes, they were evaluated for TGF-beta mRNA expression. Patients with MS had higher numbers of MBP- and PLP-responsive TGF-beta mRNA expressing cells in blood compared with control patients with other neurological diseases or myasthenia gravis and a five- and threefold further increment in their cerebrospinal fluid. In blood of patients with myasthenia gravis, where the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is a target for autoaggressive immunity, there were increased levels of AChR-responsive TGF-beta mRNA expressing cells. Thymectomized myasthenia gravis patients showed higher levels of TGF-beta mRNA expressing cells compared with patients not thymectomized. Numbers of cells responding to AChR in MS and MBP in myasthenia gravis did not differ from numbers found in absence of antigen. Patients with other neurological diseases showed infrequent and low responses to MBP, PLP, and AChR.

A new flow cell design for spectroscopic measurements of suspensions, the jet ring cell, is introduced. This cell exploits radial flow through a narrow ring-shaped gap to retain suspended particles within the detection region. This ring constitutes a detection volume of well-defined area from which the trapped particles can be instantaneously removed at will. The bed of particles thus forms a renewable surface, which can be probed by reflectance, fluorescence, or chemiluminescence using a microscope or optical fiber. This device should prove useful for microscopic study of cells, for automated immunoassays, and for preconcentration of analytes on sorbents with in situ spectroscopic detection.

7505944,"Inhibition by methylene blue of the L-arginine metabolism to L-citrulline coupled with nitric oxide synthesis in cultured endothelial cells. The effect of methylene blue on the metabolism of L-arginine to L-citrulline coupled with nitric oxide synthesis in cultured endothelial cells was investigated. The addition of the calcium ionophore ionomycin (10(-8)-10(-5) M) to endothelial cells stimulated L-citrulline formation from L-arginine. Ionomycin-stimulated L-citrulline formation was inhibited by NG-nitro-L-arginine (10(-6)-10(-4) M), a potent inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase. These results indicate that ionomycin-stimulated L-citrulline formation was coupled to nitric oxide synthesis. Therefore, L-citrulline formation from L-arginine was used as a marker for nitric oxide synthesis. Methylene blue (10(-4)-10(-3) M) inhibited ionomycin-stimulated L-citrulline formation in bovine aortic endothelial cells. Moreover, the formation of L-citrulline by the particulate fraction obtained from bovine cultured endothelial cells was also inhibited by methylene blue concentrations in excess of 10(-5) M. Although the addition of methylene blue to various tissues has been reported to release superoxide anions (Wolin et al., 1990; Marczin et al., 1992), inhibition of L-citrulline formation by methylene blue was not affected by the presence of superoxide dismutase (100 micrograms/mL) in either cultured endothelial cells or the particulate fraction.

7504954,"Analysis of nucleosome assembly and histone exchange using antibodies specific for acetylated H4. Using antibodies that specifically recognize the acetylated forms of histone H4, we show that it is possible to immunoprecipitate newly assembled (acetylated) nucleosomes. Newly replicated HeLa cell chromatin was labeled for 5-30 min with [3H]thymidine in the presence of sodium butyrate (thus inhibiting the deacetylation of newly deposited H4); bulk chromatin DNA was labeled for 24 h with [14C]thymidine. When soluble nucleosomes were incubated with immobilized antibodies, a comparison of the bound and unbound fractions showed up to a 65-fold enrichment for new chromatin DNA in the immunoprecipitate (bound), relative to the supernatant (unbound). No enrichment for new DNA was observed when preimmune control serum was used in a similar fashion. The enrichment for new DNA in the immunopellet was paralleled by a similar enrichment for all four newly synthesized histones. Acetylation was required for antibody recognition: When chromatin was replicated in the absence of butyrate (permitting histone deacetylation and chromatin maturation), equally low levels of new and old chromatin were immunoprecipitated, and no enrichment for new DNA was observed. Competition experiments confirmed these results. Analyses of histone deposition during the inhibition of DNA replication established that acetylated chromatin is the preferential target for H2A/H2B exchange. These experiments provide evidence for the highly selective assembly of newly synthesized H3, H2A, and H2B with acetylated H4, and for the involvement of histone acetylation in dynamic chromatin remodeling. In addition, immunoprecipitations of radiolabeled cytosolic extracts identified a possible somatic chromatin preassembly complex, containing newly synthesized H3 and new (acetylated) H4.",Genome engineering,analysis nucleosome assembly histone exchange using antibody specific acetylated using antibody specifically recognize acetylated form histone show possible immunoprecipitate newly assembled acetylated nucleosomes newly replicated hela cell chromatin labeled min hthymidine presence sodium butyrate thus inhibiting deacetylation newly deposited bulk chromatin dna labeled cthymidine soluble nucleosomes incubated immobilized antibody comparison bound unbound fraction showed fold enrichment new chromatin dna immunoprecipitate bound relative supernatant unbound enrichment new dna observed preimmune control serum used similar fashion enrichment new dna immunopellet paralleled similar enrichment four newly synthesized histone acetylation required antibody recognition chromatin replicated absence butyrate permitting histone deacetylation chromatin maturation equally low level new old chromatin immunoprecipitated enrichment new dna observed competition experiment confirmed result analysis histone deposition inhibition dna replication established acetylated chromatin preferential target hahb exchange experiment provide evidence highly selective assembly newly synthesized ha hb acetylated involvement histone acetylation dynamic chromatin remodeling addition immunoprecipitations radiolabeled cytosolic extract identified possible somatic chromatin preassembly complex containing newly synthesized new acetylated

Proton release from HeLa cells was stimulated by an external oxidant, potassium ferricyanide, or by the growth factor diferric transferrin. This stimulated proton release was inhibited by the antitumor sulfonylurea LY181984 [N-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-N'-(4-chlorophenyl)urea] over the concentration range 10 nM to 1 microM. The antitumor-inactive sulfonylurea analog LY181985 [N-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-N'-(phenyl)urea] was without effect at 1 microM and required 10-100 microM concentrations to inhibit proton release. Diferric transferrin-induced alkalization of the cytoplasm estimated by BCECF [2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5,(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein] fluorescence also was inhibited by 1 microM LY181984 but not by 1 microM LY181985. The inhibited component appeared to be amiloride resistant. The proton release induced by either ferricyanide or diferric transferrin was inhibited by about 35% at a near optimal amiloride concentration of 0.2 mM or at a dimethylamiloride concentration of 0.075 mM. However, the induced proton release was inhibited further by LY181984. Conversely, when proton release was inhibited fully by LY181984 at a near optimal concentration of 10 microM (50% inhibition), increasing concentrations of amiloride or dimethylamiloride resulted in additional inhibitions of 16 and 23%, respectively. However, the inhibitions by LY181984 and the amilorides were additive, suggesting that amiloride and the sulfonylureas may act independently. Evidence for an action of the sulfonylurea in inhibiting proton efflux differently from that of the amilorides came from measurements of sodium uptake either by fluorometry or by direct measurement with 22Na+. Sodium uptake was not inhibited by either LY181984 or LY181985 in HeLa cells at concentrations of LY181984 sufficient to inhibit proton efflux by 80% or more. The results show LY181984 to be a potent inhibitor of diferric transferrin- or ferricyanide-induced proton efflux and cytoplasmic alkalization in HeLa cells and that the inhibition may involve a component of proton transport that is resistant to amiloride.",Genome engineering,proton release hela cell alkalization cytoplasm induced diferric transferrin ferricyanide inhibition diarylsulfonylurea antitumor drug nmethylphenylsulfonylncholorophenyl urea ly proton release hela cell stimulated external oxidant potassium ferricyanide growth factor diferric transferrin stimulated proton release inhibited antitumor sulfonylurea ly nmethylphenylsulfonylnchlorophenylurea concentration range nm microm antitumorinactive sulfonylurea analog ly nmethylphenylsulfonylnphenylurea without effect microm required microm concentration inhibit proton release diferric transferrininduced alkalization cytoplasm estimated bcecf biscarboxyethyland carboxyfluorescein fluorescence also inhibited microm ly microm ly inhibited component appeared amiloride resistant proton release induced either ferricyanide diferric transferrin inhibited near optimal amiloride concentration mm dimethylamiloride concentration mm however induced proton release inhibited ly conversely proton release inhibited fully ly near optimal concentration microm inhibition increasing concentration amiloride dimethylamiloride resulted additional inhibition respectively however inhibition ly amilorides additive suggesting amiloride sulfonylurea may act independently evidence action sulfonylurea inhibiting proton efflux differently amilorides came measurement sodium uptake either fluorometry direct measurement na sodium uptake inhibited either ly ly hela cell concentration ly sufficient inhibit proton efflux result show ly potent inhibitor diferric transferrin ferricyanideinduced proton efflux cytoplasmic alkalization hela cell inhibition may involve component proton transport resistant amiloride

7543257,"Modulation of resistance artery force generation by extracellular Ca2+. We tested the hypothesis that increasing extracellular Ca2+ (Cao) over a physiological concentration range depresses vascular smooth muscle force generation by altering the intracellular Ca2+ (Cai)-force relationship. Mesenteric resistance arteries were isolated from Wistar rats; Cai and isometric force were measured using a fura-based method and wire myography. Vessels were depleted of releasable Cai by repeated contraction with norepinephrine; Cao was then cumulatively added back from 0.025-2.5 mM in the presence of an agonist. With norepinephrine, serotonin, prostaglandin F2 alpha, and K+, Cao from 0.025 to 0.8 mM induced a graded increase in Cai and active stress. With the receptor agonists but not K+ raising Cao from 0.8 to 1.6 mM and from 1.6 to 2.5 mM decreased active stress to 82 +/- 6 and 54 +/- 6% of maximum, respectively, P < 0.05. Although there was a transient decrease in Cai in response to both 1.6 and 2.5 mM Cao, steady-state Cai only decreased significantly in response to 2.5 mM Cao (85 +/- 3% of maximum).

7542175,"Inhibition of gap junctional communication by polyunsaturated fatty acids in WB cells: evidence that connexin 43 is not hyperphosphorylated. Polyunsaturated fatty acids have attracted much interest due to their wide spectrum of biological activities which include the modulation of gap junctional communication (GJC). Since gap junctions play critical roles in maintaining the functional integrity of organs and tissues, and loss of intercellular communication is associated with a number of pathological conditions, we investigated the effects of the n-6 and n-3 series of polyunsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives on GJC in WB cells as determined by the ability of Lucifer Yellow-loaded cells to transfer the dye to neighbouring recipient cells. Studies were also conducted to investigate the possible mechanisms of action of the fatty acids. Treatment of cells with 10 microM arachidonic acid (20:4 n-6) resulted in a rapid and transient loss of communication competence. The response to 20 microM 20:4 (n-6) was prolonged (> 210 min) but was readily reversible by washing the cells with fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Cells which had regained their communication competence responded to further additions of 20:4 (n-6). The fatty acids, 18:3 (n-6), 20:5 (n-3), 22:6 (n-3) and the 15-hydroxy- and the 15-hydroperoxy-derivatives of 20:4 (n-6) were also powerful inhibitors of GJC, while 23:4 (n-6) was a relatively weak inhibitor. The saturated 20 carbon fatty acid, 20:0, and the methyl ester of 20:4 (n-6) were without effect. This illustrates the importance of unsaturation and the carboxyl group as structural requirements for activity. 20:4 (n-6)-induced inhibition of dye transfer was not attenuated by pretreating the cells with either phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) or indomethacin, suggesting that regulation of gap junctional permeability by 20:4 (n-6) in WB cells was neither dependent on PMA-responsive isozymes of protein kinase C nor required the metabolism of the fatty acids by cyclo-oxygenase. However, the effect of 20:4 (n-6) was antagonized by preincubating WB cells with either nordihydroguaiaretic acid or (+/-)-isoproterenol and isobutylmethyl-xanthine. Western blot analysis of connexin 43 (Cx43), the major gap junctional protein expressed in these cells, revealed no detectable changes to the electrophoretic mobility of Cx43 even after 60 min of incubation in the presence of 20:4 (n-6). As expected, other inhibitors of gap junctional permeability including epidermal growth factor, phorbol ester or lysophosphatidic acid induced a retardation in the mobility of Cx43, indicating an enhancement in the phosphorylation of Cx43 protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Regulatory element,inhibition gap junctional communication polyunsaturated fatty acid wb cell evidence connexin hyperphosphorylated polyunsaturated fatty acid attracted much interest due wide spectrum biological activity include modulation gap junctional communication gjc since gap junction play critical role maintaining functional integrity organ tissue loss intercellular communication associated number pathological condition investigated effect series polyunsaturated fatty acid derivative gjc wb cell determined ability lucifer yellowloaded cell transfer dye neighbouring recipient cell study also conducted investigate possible mechanism action fatty acid treatment cell microm arachidonic acid resulted rapid transient loss communication competence response microm prolonged min readily reversible washing cell fatty acidfree bovine serum albumin cell regained communication competence responded addition fatty acid hydroxy hydroperoxyderivatives also powerful inhibitor gjc relatively weak inhibitor saturated carbon fatty acid methyl ester without effect illustrates importance unsaturation carboxyl group structural requirement activity ninduced inhibition dye transfer attenuated pretreating cell either phorbolmyristateacetate pma indomethacin suggesting regulation gap junctional permeability wb cell neither dependent pmaresponsive isozymes protein kinase required metabolism fatty acid cyclooxygenase however effect antagonized preincubating wb cell either nordihydroguaiaretic acid isoproterenol isobutylmethylxanthine western blot analysis connexin cx major gap junctional protein expressed cell revealed detectable change electrophoretic mobility cx even min incubation presence expected inhibitor gap junctional permeability including epidermal growth factor phorbol ester lysophosphatidic acid induced retardation mobility cx indicating enhancement phosphorylation cx proteinabstract truncated word
7542140,"Structure of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in a complex with the non-nucleoside inhibitor alpha-APA R 95845 at 2.8 A resolution. HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is a multifunctional enzyme that copies the RNA genome of HIV-1 into DNA. It is a heterodimer composed of a 66 kDa (p66) and a 51 kDa (p51) subunit. HIV-1 RT is a crucial target for structure-based drug design, and potent inhibitors have been identified, whose efficacy, however, is limited by drug resistance. The crystal structure of HIV-1 RT in complex with the non-nucleoside inhibitor alpha-anilinophenyl-acetamide (alpha-APA) R95845 has been determined at 2.8 A resolution. The inhibitor binds in a hydrophobic pocket near the polymerase active site. The pocket contains five aromatic amino acid residues and the interactions of the side chains of these residues with the aromatic rings of non-nucleoside inhibitors appear to be important for inhibitor binding. Most of the amino acid residues where mutations have been correlated with high levels of resistance to non-nucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 RT are located close to alpha-APA. The overall fold of HIV-1 RT in complex with alpha-APA is similar to that found when in complex with nevirapine, another non-nucleoside inhibitor, but there are significant conformational changes relative to an HIV-1 RT/DNA/Fab complex. The non-nucleoside inhibitor-binding pocket has a flexible structure whose mobility may be required for effective polymerization, and may be part of a hinge that permits relative movements of two subdomains of the p66 subunit denoted the 'palm' and 'thumb'. An understanding of the structure of the inhibitor-binding pocket, of the interactions between HIV-1 RT and alpha-APA, and of the locations of mutations that confer resistance to inhibitors provides a basis for structure-based design of chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of AIDS.",Regulatory element,structure hiv reverse transcriptase complex nonnucleoside inhibitor alphaapa resolution hiv reverse transcriptase rt multifunctional enzyme copy rna genome hiv dna heterodimer composed kda kda subunit hiv rt crucial target structurebased drug design potent inhibitor identified whose efficacy however limited drug resistance crystal structure hiv rt complex nonnucleoside inhibitor alphaanilinophenylacetamide alphaapa determined resolution inhibitor bind hydrophobic pocket near polymerase active site pocket contains five aromatic amino acid residue interaction side chain residue aromatic ring nonnucleoside inhibitor appear important inhibitor binding amino acid residue mutation correlated high level resistance nonnucleoside inhibitor hiv rt located close alphaapa overall fold hiv rt complex alphaapa similar found complex nevirapine another nonnucleoside inhibitor significant conformational change relative hiv rtdnafab complex nonnucleoside inhibitorbinding pocket flexible structure whose mobility may required effective polymerization may part hinge permit relative movement two subdomains subunit denoted palm thumb understanding structure inhibitorbinding pocket interaction hiv rt alphaapa location mutation confer resistance inhibitor provides basis structurebased design chemotherapeutic agent treatment aid

7541101,"Regional 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid production in humans. Veno-arterial plasma concentration differences and regional organ plasma flows were used to quantify the relative amounts of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) contributed by various sites into the peripheral circulation. Positive venoarterial concentration gradients were found in the hepatosplanchnic, forearm, cardiac and jugular vessels in the healthy subjects. The renal circulation was determined to be the principal site of 5-HIAA clearance, extracting 18 +/- 2 nmol/min. The gut was the greatest contributor to the total 5-HIAA plasma pool with the relative contributions of the various organs being as follows: hepatosplanchnic organs 58%, skeletal muscle 26%, brain 6% and the heart 3%. The source of 5-HIAA stemming from these regional beds remains unknown, it may derive from serotonin taken up by and deaminated in ubiquitous endothelial cells, enterochromaffin cells of the gut, peripheral serotonergic nerves, serotonin turnover in platelets or perhaps the metabolism of serotonin taken up by sympathetic nerves. To test the latter hypothesis we examined 23 patients with chronic congestive heart failure and 9 patients with pure autonomic failure to investigate the possible effects of sympathetic nervous system overactivity and underactivity on peripheral 5-HIAA production and plasma 5-HIAA concentration. The resting arterial plasma 5-HIAA concentration in the heart failure patients was increased three-fold. This elevated plasma 5-HIAA concentration was attributable to an increased rate of whole body 5-HIAA production. The arterial 5-HIAA plasma concentration in the autonomic failure patients was paradoxically elevated, being 70% greater than that of the healthy subjects. The increased 5-HIAA plasma concentration in these patients was accounted for by a reduction in 5-HIAA plasma clearance. In all subjects studied there was a weak relationship only between total body norepinephrine spillover to plasma and the arterial 5-HIAA plasma concentration.

7540125,"New therapeutic strategies involving radiation therapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Recent notable developments have occurred involving radiation therapy (RT) for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For patients with good performance status with unresected thoracic tumors, induction cisplatin-based chemotherapy followed by RT has resulted in a significant survival advantage over RT alone in two North American trials. However, the best sequence of administration of these two modalities in NSCLC remains to be determined. For palliation of tumor-related symptoms, efforts under way to improve control of brain metastases include the use of twice-daily cranial RT to a higher total dose, the use of focused radiation boost techniques like stereotactic radiosurgery to small metastatic deposits, and increased use of neurosurgical extirpation. For patients with NSCLC with symptomatic bone metastases, use of wider-field irradiation may benefit selected patients. Metastases to the adrenal gland, liver, and subcutaneous tissues can be palliated successfully by brief courses of RT. Intrathoracic tumor symptoms are well palliated by brief courses of thoracic RT. As adjuvant therapy following curative surgery, RT reduces the intrathoracic tumor recurrence rate among patients with metastatic tumor foci in hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes.",Regulatory element,new therapeutic strategy involving radiation therapy patient nonsmall cell lung cancer recent notable development occurred involving radiation therapy rt patient nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc patient good performance status unresected thoracic tumor induction cisplatinbased chemotherapy followed rt resulted significant survival advantage rt alone two north american trial however best sequence administration two modality nsclc remains determined palliation tumorrelated symptom effort way improve control brain metastasis include use twicedaily cranial rt higher total dose use focused radiation boost technique like stereotactic radiosurgery small metastatic deposit increased use neurosurgical extirpation patient nsclc symptomatic bone metastasis use widerfield irradiation may benefit selected patient metastasis adrenal gland liver subcutaneous tissue palliated successfully brief course rt intrathoracic tumor symptom well palliated brief course thoracic rt adjuvant therapy following curative surgery rt reduces intrathoracic tumor recurrence rate among patient metastatic tumor focus hilar mediastinal lymph node
7539903,"Expression of CD44 and its clinical implication in diffuse-type and intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinomas. Knowing the differential expression of CD44 isoforms in intestinal- and diffuse-type gastric carcinomas, we used antibodies against the standard form of CD44 (CD44s) and the domain encoded by exon v6 (CD44v6) in 103 patients with primary gastric adenocarcinomas to explore the role of CD44 isoforms in metastases of both types of gastric cancer. Carcinomas of the intestinal type were more frequently CD44s and CD44v6 positive than carcinomas of the diffuse type (p = 0.034 for CD44s and p = 0.022 for CD44v6). The reactivity to these two antibodies did not correlate with histopathological and clinical prognostic factors in intestinal-type carcinoma. In contrast, expression of CD44v6 was associated with infiltrative tumor growth (p = 0.021), depth of invasion (p = 0.012), lymph node involvement (p = 0.005) and a higher incidence of distant metastasis (p = 0.069) in cancers of the diffuse type. CD44s-expressing diffuse-type tumors had a higher incidence of distant metastasis at presentation (p = 0.001), but expression of CD44s was not correlated with other clinicopathologic indices. For all cases, there was a nonsignificant association between CD44s expression and poor survival. Unexpectedly, there was also no significant difference in survival regarding expression of CD44v6 for all cases or the diffuse-type subset.

7539754,"Phagocyte-induced antigen-specific activation of unprimed CD8+ T cells in vitro. The strict segregation of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II loading pathways has been challenged by recent reports indicating that MHC class I molecules can acquire antigen in the phagocytic pathway. We now show that this alternative peptide loading pathway can be used efficiently to generate macrophages able to activate unprimed antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells in vitro. Short peptides (8-11 residues), administered in the phagocytic pathway at nanomolar concentrations, were found to be effective in specifically activating naïve cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in vitro, but longer peptides or whole protein antigen were not. Whole protein antigen coated on beads did, however, render macrophages susceptible to lysis by an antigen-specific CTL clone. This indicates that proteolysis in the phagocytic pathway has limited capability for class I-restricted presentation. We propose a model for class I loading in the phagocytic pathway consisting of direct trafficking of nascent MHC class I from the trans-Golgi network to the phagosome, prior to appearance at the cell surface, and the use of the narrow cavity between bead and phagosomal membrane as a peptide exchange/loading compartment. Targeting immunogenic class I-binding peptide to the phagocytic pathway of macrophages facilitates presentation in association with class I.

7539514,"Resistance to APO-1 (CD95) induced apoptosis in T-ALL is determined by a BCL-2 independent anti-apoptotic program. Selective induction of programmed cell death, apoptosis, may represent a new approach to the treatment of cancer. Apoptosis can be induced by the monoclonal antibody anti-APO-1 directed against the cell surface receptor APO-1, a member of the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor/tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily. We determined APO-1 expression and sensitivity to anti-APO-1 mediated apoptosis in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells of T lymphocyte precursor phenotype (T-ALL). APO-1 was constitutively expressed by 21 of 30 T-ALL and by all T-ALL cell lines investigated. However, most APO-1 positive T-ALL were resistant to anti-APO-1 mediated apoptosis. Sensitivity to anti-APO-1 mediated apoptosis was independent of the density of APO-1 expression on the cell surface and independent of the amount of Bcl-2. Incubation of resistant T-ALL with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide reversed resistance and induced sensitivity to anti-APO-1 mediated apoptosis in most T-ALL. These data suggest that resistance to anti-APO-1 mediated apoptosis in T-ALL is maintained by an active cellular program. Reversion of resistance to sensitivity towards induction of apoptosis in tumors may provide a new basis for successful therapeutic intervention.",Regulatory element,resistance apo cd induced apoptosis tall determined bcl independent antiapoptotic program selective induction programmed cell death apoptosis may represent new approach treatment cancer apoptosis induced monoclonal antibody antiapo directed cell surface receptor apo member nerve growth factor ngf receptortumor necrosis factor tnf receptor superfamily determined apo expression sensitivity antiapo mediated apoptosis childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lymphocyte precursor phenotype tall apo constitutively expressed tall tall cell line investigated however apo positive tall resistant antiapo mediated apoptosis sensitivity antiapo mediated apoptosis independent density apo expression cell surface independent amount bcl incubation resistant tall protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide reversed resistance induced sensitivity antiapo mediated apoptosis tall data suggest resistance antiapo mediated apoptosis tall maintained active cellular program reversion resistance sensitivity towards induction apoptosis tumor may provide new basis successful therapeutic intervention

To determine the various roles of RNase H in reverse transcription, we generated a panel of mutations in the RNase H domain of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase based on sequence alignments and the crystal structures of Escherichia coli and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNases H (S. W. Blain and S. P. Goff, J. Biol. Chem. 268:23585-23592, 1993). These mutations were introduced into a full-length provirus, and the resulting genomes were tested for infectivity by transient transfection assays or after generation of stable producer lines. Several of the mutant viruses replicated normally, some showed significant delays in infectivity, and others were noninfectious. Virions were collected, and the products of the endogenous reverse transcription reaction were examined to determine which steps might be affected by these mutations. Some mutants left their minus-strand strong-stop DNA in RNA-DNA hybrid form, in a manner similar to that of RNase H null mutants. Some mutants showed increased polymerase pausing. Others were impaired in first-strand translocation, independently of their wild-type ability to degrade genomic RNA, suggesting a new role for RNase H in strand transfer. DNA products synthesized in vivo by the wild-type and mutant viruses were also examined. Whereas wild-type virus did not accumulate detectable levels of minus-strand strong-stop DNA, several mutants were blocked in translocation and did accumulate this intermediate.

7538195,"Camptothecin induction of a time- and concentration-dependent decrease of topoisomerase I and its implication in camptothecin activity. Camptothecin (CPT) has been shown to induce protein-linked DNA breaks (PLDB), which are stabilized intermediates of topoisomerase I (TOP1) activity. Due to the reversible nature of PLDB and the need for replication fork movement for CPT toxicity, both the time of CPT exposure and TOP1 levels are determinants of CPT toxicity. Therefore, the effects of CPT exposure on TOP1 over time were examined in an established human cell line, KB. Using an in vivo KCl-SDS co-precipitation assay, it was determined that 1 hr of CPT exposure resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in PLDB that reached a maximum at 5 microM CPT. However, prolonged incubations with CPT revealed a concentration- and time-dependent decrease in CPT-induced PLDB formation. The most rapid loss of PLDB was within 6 hr. Neither aphidicolin nor cycloheximide cotreatments altered the PLDB decrease induced by CPT. Immunoblot analysis revealed a reduction in TOP1 protein upon CPT exposure, whereas RNA analysis revealed no changes, which suggested a post-transciptional mechanism of TOP1 down-regulation. The CPT-induced reduction was specific for TOP1, because actin and tubulin levels were unaltered by CPT exposure. Finally, clonogenic assays revealed a small but statistically significant decrease in CPT toxicity throughout the CPT exposure period. Because PLDB formation based on TOP1 levels is an important step in the toxicity of CPT, the CPT-induced TOP1 reduction could be a transient mechanism of resistance for cells to avoid toxic levels of PLDB.",Regulatory element,camptothecin induction time concentrationdependent decrease topoisomerase implication camptothecin activity camptothecin cpt shown induce proteinlinked dna break pldb stabilized intermediate topoisomerase top activity due reversible nature pldb need replication fork movement cpt toxicity time cpt exposure top level determinant cpt toxicity therefore effect cpt exposure top time examined established human cell line kb using vivo kclsds coprecipitation assay determined hr cpt exposure resulted concentrationdependent increase pldb reached maximum microm cpt however prolonged incubation cpt revealed concentration timedependent decrease cptinduced pldb formation rapid loss pldb within hr neither aphidicolin cycloheximide cotreatments altered pldb decrease induced cpt immunoblot analysis revealed reduction top protein upon cpt exposure whereas rna analysis revealed change suggested posttransciptional mechanism top downregulation cptinduced reduction specific top actin tubulin level unaltered cpt exposure finally clonogenic assay revealed small statistically significant decrease cpt toxicity throughout cpt exposure period pldb formation based top level important step toxicity cpt cptinduced top reduction transient mechanism resistance cell avoid toxic level pldb

We analyzed the cytolytic activity of NK cells against thymocyte targets from normal and lpr mice, and found that the NK cells killed thymocytes from normal mice but not from lpr mice. On the other hand, splenic T cells did not show any cytotoxicity against either of the thymocyte targets. Similarly, NK cells exhibited cytotoxicity against transfectants expressing Fas antigen but not against parental cells or transfectants expressing a mutant Fas antigen with deleted cytoplasmic region.

7528765,"Dual binding capacity of mucosal immunoblasts to mucosal and synovial endothelium in humans: dissection of the molecular mechanisms. Lymphocytes continuously migrate throughout the body in search of antigens. Virgin lymphocytes recirculate freely between the blood and different lymphatic organs, whereas immunoblasts extravasate preferentially into sites similar to those where they initially responded to antigen. Tissue-specific extravasation of lymphocytes is largely controlled by distinct lymphocyte surface receptors that mediate lymphocyte binding to high endothelial venules (HEV). In the present study, the molecular mechanisms determining the specificity of human mucosal (lamina propria) lymphocyte binding to different endothelial recognition systems were analyzed. Mucosal immunoblasts adhered five times better than small mucosal lymphocytes to mucosal HEV. Importantly, mucosal immunoblasts also bound to synovial HEV almost as efficiently as to mucosal HEV, but they did not adhere to peripheral lymph node HEV. To study the impact of different homing-associated molecules in this dual endothelial binding, we used a gut-derived T cell line and freshly isolated mucosal immunoblasts. Both cell types expressed integrins alpha 4, beta 1, beta 7, and lymphocyte function associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), and were CD44 positive, but practically L-selectin negative. Binding of mucosal immunoblasts to mucosal HEV was almost completely abolished by pretreatment with anti-beta 7 monoclonal antibodies, but it was independent of alpha 4/beta 1 function. In contrast, alpha 4/beta 1 partially mediated immunoblast adherence to synovial HEV, whereas alpha 4/beta 7 had only a minor role in adherence of blasts at this site. CD44 and LFA-1 contributed to HEV-binding both in mucosa and synovium. Taken together, this is the first report that demonstrates a critical role for alpha 4/beta 7 in the binding of gut lymphocytes to mucosal venules in humans. Moreover, a hitherto unknown interaction between mucosal effector cells and synovial endothelial cells was shown to be only partially mediated by the currently known homing receptors. The dual endothelial binding capacity of mucosal blasts may help to explain the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis not uncommonly associated with inflammatory and infectious bowel disease.",Regulatory element,dual binding capacity mucosal immunoblasts mucosal synovial endothelium human dissection molecular mechanism lymphocyte continuously migrate throughout body search antigen virgin lymphocyte recirculate freely blood different lymphatic organ whereas immunoblasts extravasate preferentially site similar initially responded antigen tissuespecific extravasation lymphocyte largely controlled distinct lymphocyte surface receptor mediate lymphocyte binding high endothelial venule hev present study molecular mechanism determining specificity human mucosal lamina propria lymphocyte binding different endothelial recognition system analyzed mucosal immunoblasts adhered five time better small mucosal lymphocyte mucosal hev importantly mucosal immunoblasts also bound synovial hev almost efficiently mucosal hev adhere peripheral lymph node hev study impact different homingassociated molecule dual endothelial binding used gutderived cell line freshly isolated mucosal immunoblasts cell type expressed integrins alpha beta beta lymphocyte function associated antigen lfa cd positive practically lselectin negative binding mucosal immunoblasts mucosal hev almost completely abolished pretreatment antibeta monoclonal antibody independent alpha beta function contrast alpha beta partially mediated immunoblast adherence synovial hev whereas alpha beta minor role adherence blast site cd lfa contributed hevbinding mucosa synovium taken together first report demonstrates critical role alpha beta binding gut lymphocyte mucosal venule human moreover hitherto unknown interaction mucosal effector cell synovial endothelial cell shown partially mediated currently known homing receptor dual endothelial binding capacity mucosal blast may help explain pathogenesis reactive arthritis uncommonly associated inflammatory infectious bowel disease
7519947,"Bio-histochemical aspects of integrins (alpha 2 beta 1, alpha 6 beta 1) in invasive mammary carcinomas: an immunohistochemical study. Immunohistochemical expression of integrins was examined in 39 human invasive mammary carcinomas, of which 34.2% and 43.6% expressed integrins alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 1, respectively. Immuno-electron microscopy clearly demonstrated that the integrins were in the cell membrane of the carcinoma cells. Similar expression of integrin alpha 2 beta 1 or alpha 6 beta 1 in both the intraductal component and invasive portion of the same tumor was seen in 76.9% and 85.7% of cases, respectively. This suggested that invasive carcinoma cells retained their integrin expression after invasion through the basement membrane. Reciprocal expression of integrins alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 1 was seen in 20 cases. Expression of alpha 2 beta 1 was seen significantly less frequently in scirrhous carcinoma than in the more differentiated papillotubular or solid tubular carcinoma (Chi-squared test, P < 0.05). Intraductal components of carcinoma were present more frequently in cases expressing integrin alpha 2 beta 1 than in those that were negative.

The authors report the results of a series of dissections and anatomic sections of the fronto-basal region of the brain and of the anterior cranial fossa in human cadavers. The constant presence of an arachnoidal cistern above the olfactory nerve was verified. The arachnoid separates from the pial membrane and forms a bridge with the ventral part of the olfactory bulb and tract, from the lateral edge of the olfactory sulcus to the medial edge of the gyrus rectus. The cistern is wide in its anterior portion, between the gyrus rectus and the olfactory bulb, and is reduced to a virtual slit in its posterior portion where the tract is lodged in the olfactory sulcus. The olfactory nerve can be separated without damaging fronto-basal arachnoidial adhesions over several centimeters. Dissection of this region after intravascular injection of colored media shows the constant presence of an artery destined to the olfactory bulb and tract. It originates either from the lateral surface of the anterior cerebral a.

7537203,"Modulation of motor activity by cutaneous input: inhibition of the magnetic motor evoked potential by digital electrical stimulation. We examined the inhibitory effect of a brief train of digital (D2) electrical stimuli at 4 times perception threshold on transcranial magnetic motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded from abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscles ipsilateral to the side of D2 stimulation. We compared this to the inhibitory effect of ipsilateral D2 stimulation on averaged rectified EMG recorded at 10% maximum voluntary contraction and on F-responses and H-reflexes recorded from these same muscles. We also compared MEPs recorded following D2 stimulation just above perception threshold to MEPs following higher intensity D2 stimulation. As well, we assessed the effect of preceding D2 stimulation on MEPs recorded from a relaxed versus tonically contracted hand muscle. D2 stimulation elicited a triphasic response of modest MEP facilitation followed by inhibition and further facilitation. The duration and onset of MEP inhibition correlated with those of the initial period of rectified EMG inhibition, however, the magnitude of MEP inhibition was generally less than the magnitude of EMG inhibition, consistent with a greater inhibitory effect of digital afferents on smaller motor neurons. MEPs were not facilitated during the rebound of EMG activity (the E2 period) that usually followed the initial period of EMG inhibition (I1 period). The behavior of H-reflexes and F-responses following ipsilateral D2 stimulation suggested that inhibition of both EMG and MEPs is not mediated via presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents, and that inhibition is augmented by descending rather than segmental input to spinal motor neurons. Tonic contraction of the target muscle during D2 stimulation decreased the inhibitory effect of the preceding digital stimulus possibly due to recruitment of larger spinal motor neurons less likely to be inhibited by cutaneous input.",Regulatory element,modulation motor activity cutaneous input inhibition magnetic motor evoked potential digital electrical stimulation examined inhibitory effect brief train digital electrical stimulus time perception threshold transcranial magnetic motor evoked potential meps recorded abductor pollicis brevis apb flexor carpus radialis fcr muscle ipsilateral side stimulation compared inhibitory effect ipsilateral stimulation averaged rectified emg recorded maximum voluntary contraction fresponses hreflexes recorded muscle also compared meps recorded following stimulation perception threshold meps following higher intensity stimulation well assessed effect preceding stimulation meps recorded relaxed versus tonically contracted hand muscle stimulation elicited triphasic response modest mep facilitation followed inhibition facilitation duration onset mep inhibition correlated initial period rectified emg inhibition however magnitude mep inhibition generally le magnitude emg inhibition consistent greater inhibitory effect digital afferent smaller motor neuron meps facilitated rebound emg activity period usually followed initial period emg inhibition period behavior hreflexes fresponses following ipsilateral stimulation suggested inhibition emg meps mediated via presynaptic inhibition ia afferent inhibition augmented descending rather segmental input spinal motor neuron tonic contraction target muscle stimulation decreased inhibitory effect preceding digital stimulus possibly due recruitment larger spinal motor neuron le likely inhibited cutaneous input

Immunocytochemistry has often been used to identify tumor cells in bone marrow aspirate (BMA) of SCLC patients in order to improve the results of conventional histomorphology. However, whether the detection of bone marrow microlocalisation at diagnosis had implications for prognosis has not been clear. Eighty-four slides (44 patients) and 66 bone marrow biopsies (from 42/44 patients) were evaluated. Cytospins of BMA were incubated with the monoclonal antibody (MAb) NCC-LU-243, recognising the cluster 1 antigen (NCAM) and then stained by the APAAP (alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase) method. The relationship among BMA and PS (performance status), NSE (neuron-specific enolase), stage, survival was also studied. 33/84 (39%) BMA were positive for NCAM, compared with 8/66 (12%) bone marrow biopsies (p = 0.009), (17/44 and 6/42 patients, respectively). Moreover, BMA was positive for NCAM in 6/19 patients with limited disease.

The producer was taxonomically characterized as Streptomyces purpurascens. Active principles designated TAN-1323 A-D were isolated and determined to be 18-membered macrolide antibiotics; components C and D are new members of this group, while components A and B are identical to concanamycins C and A, respectively. When tested in the CAM assay, components B and D gave huge avascular zones at the extremely low doses of 10-100 ng/disk, although components A and C showed far weaker activity due to their preferential tissue-damaging effect on the CAM. The discovery that these 18-membered macrolide antibiotics are angiostatic substances prompted us to examine other types of macrolide antibiotics, leading to the discovery that 16-membered macrolide antibiotics such as bafilomycin C1, tylosin and leucomycin also show angiostatic activity on the CAM. Thus, angiostatic potential is widely distributed among macrolide antibiotics.

To elucidate the molecular basis of band 3 deficiency in a recently defined subset of patients with autosomal dominant hereditary spherocytosis (HS), we screened band 3 cDNA for single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). In 5 of 17 (29%) unrelated HS subjects with band 3 deficiency, we detected substitutions R760W, R760Q, R808C, and R870W that were all coinherited with the HS phenotype. The involved arginines are highly conserved throughout evolution. To examine whether or not the product of the mutant allele is inserted into the membrane, we studied one HS subject who was doubly heterozygous for the R760Q mutation and the K56E (band 3sMEMPHIS) polymorphism that results in altered electrophoretic mobility of the band 3 Memphis proteolytic fragments. We detected only the band 3MEMPHIS in the erythrocyte membrane indicating that the protein product of the mutant, R760Q, band 3 allele is absent from the red blood cell membrane.

7523559,"L-selectin mediates downregulation of neutrophil TNF receptors. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a potent activator of neutrophil granulocytes, which acts via two cell-surface receptors: the p55-TNF receptor (TNF-R55) and the p75-TNF receptor (TNF-R75). Proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular region of the receptors results in formation of soluble TNF-binding proteins, TNF-R55-BP and TNF-R75-BP. We recently reported that adherence alone, without any further stimuli, causes release of both TNF-R55-BP and TNF-R75-BP and that both leukocyte-integrin-dependent and non-integrin-dependent adherence mechanisms can modulate TNF receptor expression. In the present work we show that crosslinking of a mAb to the adhesion protein L-selectin (TQ1) on the surface of neutrophils results in downregulation of TNF-receptor binding capacity. Furthermore, when the fluctuations of cytosolic free calcium found in adherent neutrophils were blocked with the cell-permeable calcium chelator BAPTA, adherence-induced release of TNF-R55-BP was inhibited.

7521341,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 increases secretion of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-4 (IGFBP-4) by human osteoblast-like cells in vitro and elevates IGFBP-4 serum levels in vivo. Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) are thought to play an important role in the regulation of bone metabolism. In the present study, we investigated the effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25-(OH)2D3] on the expression and secretion of IGFBPs in human osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cells (MG63) and untransformed human bone-derived cells in vitro. Northern blot analysis revealed that 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10(-8) mol/L) increased IGFBP-4 messenger RNA maximally 11-fold over control level in MG63 cells (after 24 h treatment) and 2.8-fold in human bone-derived cells (at 10(-10) mol/L). 1,25-(OH)2D3 increased secretion of IGFBP-4 2- and 3-fold, respectively, in MG63 cells and in human bone-derived cells. In normal human bone-derived cells, 1,25-(OH)2D3 also stimulated messenger RNA expression (3.9-fold) and the secretion of IGFBP-3 (2.2-fold). 1,25-(OH)2D3 also increased IGFBP-4 expression in skin fibroblasts but not in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.

7519304,"T cell epitope recognition involved in the low-responsiveness to a region of hen egg lysozyme (46-61) in C57BL/6 mice. The predominant T cell epitope of hen egg lysozyme (HEL) in high-responder C3H mice has been previously identified as the HEL 46-61 region. In contrast, this region is poorly recognized by T cells from low-responder C57BL/6 mice upon immunization with HEL. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that several C57BL/6 derived T cell hybridomas reactive to this epitope and other HEL epitopes preferentially recognize phosphorylcholine (PC)-conjugated HEL over unconjugated HEL. To understand the mechanisms involved in this difference of T cell recognition, we have further analysed the reactivity of T cells and T cell hybridomas from low-responder C57BL/6 mice. T cells from HEL-immunized mice were preferentially reactive to HEL 47-60. These results suggest a potential deficiency in generating an appropriate T cell epitope from the 46-61 region of native HEL in low-responder C57BL/6 mice. The minimal T cell epitope of this region was defined as HEL 51-60 using the PCH4.1 T hybridoma clone. This minimal epitope represents a single amino acid shift from the minimal epitope of HEL high-responder C3H mice (HEL 52-61). Various peptides representing this region were synthesized with single alanine substitutions at each position. The residues at positions 51, 52, 53 and 57 of HEL appear to be involved in Ia binding and the residues at 55 and 56 in contracting the TCR. T cell reactivity to HEL 51-61 peptides with various substitutions at position 61 strongly suggest that primarily the size of the C-terminal residue interferes with binding to the Ia molecules of low-responder mice. In addition, substitutions of the TCR contacting residues at positions 55 and 56 with similar residues (isoleucine-->leucine or leucine-->isoleucine) significantly increased the T cell reactivity, suggesting a low reactivity with the native residues. Therefore, the requirement of many residues in the T cell epitope for interaction with Ia, the necessity for additional Ag processing to facilitate Ia binding, and the low affinity of the TCR contacting residues may together render C57BL/6 mice unresponsive to the HE 46-61 region.",Regulatory element,cell epitope recognition involved lowresponsiveness region hen egg lysozyme cbl mouse predominant cell epitope hen egg lysozyme hel highresponder ch mouse previously identified hel region contrast region poorly recognized cell lowresponder cbl mouse upon immunization hel previous study demonstrated several cbl derived cell hybridoma reactive epitope hel epitope preferentially recognize phosphorylcholine pcconjugated hel unconjugated hel understand mechanism involved difference cell recognition analysed reactivity cell cell hybridoma lowresponder cbl mouse cell helimmunized mouse preferentially reactive hel result suggest potential deficiency generating appropriate cell epitope region native hel lowresponder cbl mouse minimal cell epitope region defined hel using pch hybridoma clone minimal epitope represents single amino acid shift minimal epitope hel highresponder ch mouse hel various peptide representing region synthesized single alanine substitution position residue position hel appear involved ia binding residue contracting tcr cell reactivity hel peptide various substitution position strongly suggest primarily size cterminal residue interferes binding ia molecule lowresponder mouse addition substitution tcr contacting residue position similar residue isoleucineleucine leucineisoleucine significantly increased cell reactivity suggesting low reactivity native residue therefore requirement many residue cell epitope interaction ia necessity additional ag processing facilitate ia binding low affinity tcr contacting residue may together render cbl mouse unresponsive region
7473168,"Critical role for glucocorticoid receptors in stress- and ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization. Locomotor sensitization, the augmentation of the locomotor-activating effects of stimuli with repeated exposure, is being evaluated as a partial model for several phenomena including drug addiction. Alteration of dopaminergic systems has been found in sensitized animals and dopamine neurotransmission appears to be crucial for the expression of sensitized behaviors. However, stress hormones, which are released after exposure to many of the stimuli that produce sensitization, may also be involved in the development of this phenomenon. Corticosterone appears to be important in the development of amphetamine sensitization and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) have been hypothesized to mediate this effect. The purpose of these experiments was first, to determine whether repeated restraint stress sensitizes DBA/2J mice to the activating effect of ethanol (EtOH), and second, to explore the role of GR in stress- and EtOH-induced sensitization with the GR antagonist, RU 38486. This antagonist was administered before restraint or i.p. EtOH (1.5 g/kg) on each of 10 consecutive days of pretreatment. In addition, plasma corticosterone levels were determined at various points throughout the pretreatment period and on test days. The results demonstrated that 10 consecutive days of 2-hr restraint sensitized mice to EtOH's locomotor-stimulating effect.

The primary transcript of the calcitonin (CT)/calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is alternatively spliced in a cell-specific fashion to produce CT in thyroid C cells and CGRP in neuronal cells. The key step in this regulatory process is the recognition and inclusion of exon 4 to produce CT mRNA or nonrecognition and exclusion of exon 4 to produce CGRP mRNA. To determine whether inclusion/exclusion of CT exon is regulated independently of its position, we created a series of minigene constructs containing decreasing amounts of CT gene sequence. A human glioblastoma cell line, T98G, was tested and used as a CT exon exclusion cell line, while HeLa cells were used as a CT exon inclusion cell line. CT exon inclusion/exclusion was regulated when either the relative position of exon 4 within the CT gene was changed or when the exon with flanking sequence was inserted into a completely heterologous gene. Our results demonstrate that CT exon functions as a unit in a position-independent fashion in regulating its own inclusion/exclusion.

7535798,"P-selectin/ICAM-1 double mutant mice: acute emigration of neutrophils into the peritoneum is completely absent but is normal into pulmonary alveoli. Neutrophil emigration during an inflammatory response is mediated through interactions between adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and neutrophils. P-Selectin mediates rolling or slowing of neutrophils, while intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) contributes to the firm adhesion and emigration of neutrophils. Removing the function of either molecule partially prevents neutrophil emigration. To analyze further the role of P-selectin and ICAM-1, we have generated a line of mice with mutations in both of these molecules. While mice with either mutation alone show a 60-70% reduction in acute neutrophil emigration into the peritoneum during Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced peritonitis, double mutant mice show a complete loss of neutrophil emigration. In contrast, neutrophil emigration into the alveolar spaces during acute S. pneumoniae-induced pneumonia is normal in double mutant mice. These data demonstrate organ-specific differences, since emigration into the peritoneum requires both adhesion molecules while emigration into the lung requires neither.

The epitopes recognized by the four MAbs were characterized using BBI in its native form or modified by different methods. MAb 3B6 reacted with native BBI. Partial reduction of BBI with 720 Gy of gamma radiation in an oxygen-free solution of 100 mM formate increased the reactivity of BBI with 3B6; however, extensive reduction of BBI with 100 mM DL-dithiothreitol (DTT) completely abolished this antigenic reactivity. In contrast, the other three MAbs reacted with BBI molecules that had been reduced either with 720 Gy of radiation in formate solution or with DTT. Alkylation of the radiochemically reduced BBI with N-ethylmaleimide further increased the reactivity of BBI with 3E3, 4H8 and 5G2, possibly by preventing the formation of new disulfide bonds within the BBI molecules. The binding of 4H8 and 5G2 to BBI antigen was inhibited by the binding of 3E3, and vice versa. Thus, the epitopes recognized by 3E3, 4H8 and 5G2 are probably located close to one another on the reduced BBI molecules. These three MAbs were able to react with BBI metabolites in urine samples collected from volunteers after oral administration of BBI. The ability of these MAbs to detect BBI metabolites indicates that BBI may be reductively modified in vivo and these MAbs may be useful reagents for monitoring the uptake of BBI into human tissues in cancer chemoprevention studies with BBI.",Regulatory element,monoclonal antibody differentially reactive native reductively modified bowmanbirk protease inhibitor bowmanbirk protease inhibitor bbi potent anticarcinogen suppresses malignant transformation nanomolar concentration small amount bbi native form measured immunoassay using specific monoclonal antibody mabs however mabs currently available capable detecting bbi metabolite human body fluid develop new reagent study bbi exposure pharmacokinetics produced four mabs designated hybridoma derived mouse immunized reductively modified bbi epitope recognized four mabs characterized using bbi native form modified different method mab reacted native bbi partial reduction bbi gy gamma radiation oxygenfree solution mm formate increased reactivity bbi however extensive reduction bbi mm dldithiothreitol dtt completely abolished antigenic reactivity contrast three mabs reacted bbi molecule reduced either gy radiation formate solution dtt alkylation radiochemically reduced bbi nethylmaleimide increased reactivity bbi possibly preventing formation new disulfide bond within bbi molecule binding bbi antigen inhibited binding vice versa thus epitope recognized probably located close one another reduced bbi molecule three mabs able react bbi metabolite urine sample collected volunteer oral administration bbi ability mabs detect bbi metabolite indicates bbi may reductively modified vivo mabs may useful reagent monitoring uptake bbi human tissue cancer chemoprevention study bbi
7532634,"Effects of antigen retrieval by microwave heating in formalin-fixed tissue sections on a broad panel of antibodies. Formaldehyde fixation of biopsy specimens for routine purposes has often been held responsible for the poor reproducibility of immunohistochemical studies. Recently, antigen retrieval (AGR) using microwave irradiation was described as a potential tool to enhance immunostaining. A comparison of conventional staining and staining after microwave heating was performed for 52 markers, using tissues fixed in formaldehyde for 24 h, 1 to 6 weeks and 3 years respectively, as well as consultant case material. After adequate duration of fixation (24 h), only a few markers (17%) showed better results after AGR, but this percentage was increased to 50% when tissues were fixed for longer periods. Maximal enhancement was obtained in the group of consultant cases (58% of tested markers demonstrated better staining results), in which the period of fixation and tissue processing was unknown. To achieve reliable enhancement with AGR, continuous heating (100 degrees C) should not be shorter than 20 min. In conclusion, AGR may become the most important tool to simplify and equalize immunohistochemical techniques, if critically evaluated.",Regulatory element,effect antigen retrieval microwave heating formalinfixed tissue section broad panel antibody formaldehyde fixation biopsy specimen routine purpose often held responsible poor reproducibility immunohistochemical study recently antigen retrieval agr using microwave irradiation described potential tool enhance immunostaining comparison conventional staining staining microwave heating performed marker using tissue fixed formaldehyde week year respectively well consultant case material adequate duration fixation marker showed better result agr percentage increased tissue fixed longer period maximal enhancement obtained group consultant case tested marker demonstrated better staining result period fixation tissue processing unknown achieve reliable enhancement agr continuous heating degree shorter min conclusion agr may become important tool simplify equalize immunohistochemical technique critically evaluated
7532622,"Regulation of an oligodendrocyte progenitor cell line by the interleukin-6 family of cytokines. We report pleiotropic actions of the interleukin-6 family of cytokines on a rat cerebral cortical oligodendrocyte cell line, Central Glia-4 (CG-4). This is a bipotential oligodendrocyte type-2 astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor cell line that can be manipulated in vitro to become either a type-2 astrocyte or to follow a linear sequence of events into becoming a mature oligodendrocyte. Using Northern and Western analyses in conjunction with immunocytochemistry we have demonstrated that ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) cause a transient increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in oligodendrocyte type-2 astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor cells. At maximal cytokine concentrations, the largest increase in GFAP protein levels were observed for CNTF and LIF; albeit, IL-6 did increase GFAP but the order of magnitude was 6-7 times less. Moreover, in trophic factor deprived medium, CNTF and LIF protected immature (O4+/MBP-) and mature (MBP+) oligodendrocytes from the apoptotic mode of cell death, while IL-6 had no effect in enhancing oligodendrocyte cell survival. Analysis of the cytokine-induced early response genes (ERGs) revealed a strong degree of overlap for CNTF and LIF. The effect of IL-6 was different in the degree to which the ERGs were up-regulated and in their temporal patterns of expression. These findings suggest that ERGs may be important, at least in part, for determining the extent of functional overlap observed within this cytokine family.

7532611,"[Prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection among chronic hemodialysis patients]. A high prevalence of HCV (hepatitis C virus) antibodies have been reported in chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients. In this study, sera from 584 hemodialysis patients (378 males and 206 females) were examined for the 2nd generation HCV antibody by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and for HCV-RNA by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. The positive rates of HCV antibody and HCV-RNA were 22.0% (129/584) and 12.3% (72/584), respectively. In HD patients, HCV infections were considered to be caused by the contact with contaminated blood samples, the main cause of which is blood transfusions. However, a high prevalence of HCV markers even in HD patients without a history of blood transfusions indicates that there may be other ways of HCV transmission other than blood transfusions. While HCV-RNA was detected in about 50% of the HD patients with the HCV antibody, this rate was lower than that found in the general population with the HCV antibody. And the abnormality rate of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in HD patients with HCV-RNA was lower than that of the general population with HCV-RNA. On the other hand, the amounts of HCV-RNA which were semiquantified by RT-PCR using the end-point dilution method showed a correlation with serum ALT levels in both HD patients and chronic HCV infections. Moreover, HCV-RNA titers measured immediately after hemodialysis showed a marked decrease compared with those measured before hemodialysis. These results suggest that HCV was eliminated to certain extent with hemodialysis and that it might also be the cause of the low abnormality rate of serum ALT in HD patients with HCV-RNA.",Regulatory element,prevalence hepatitis virus infection among chronic hemodialysis patient high prevalence hcv hepatitis virus antibody reported chronic hemodialysis hd patient study serum hemodialysis patient male female examined nd generation hcv antibody enzyme immunoassay eia hcvrna reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction rtpcr method positive rate hcv antibody hcvrna respectively hd patient hcv infection considered caused contact contaminated blood sample main cause blood transfusion however high prevalence hcv marker even hd patient without history blood transfusion indicates may way hcv transmission blood transfusion hcvrna detected hd patient hcv antibody rate lower found general population hcv antibody abnormality rate serum alanine aminotransferase alt hd patient hcvrna lower general population hcvrna hand amount hcvrna semiquantified rtpcr using endpoint dilution method showed correlation serum alt level hd patient chronic hcv infection moreover hcvrna titer measured immediately hemodialysis showed marked decrease compared measured hemodialysis result suggest hcv eliminated certain extent hemodialysis might also cause low abnormality rate serum alt hd patient hcvrna
7531157,"The periaqueductal gray in the cat projects to lamina VIII and the medial part of lamina VII throughout the length of the spinal cord. The periaqueductal gray (PAG) plays an important role in analgesia as well as in motor activities, such as vocalization, cardiovascular changes, and movements of the neck, back, and hind limbs. Although the anatomical pathways for vocalization and cardiovascular control are rather well understood, this is not the case for the pathways controlling the neck, back, and hind limb movements. This led us to study the direct projections from the PAG to the spinal cord in the cat. In a retrograde tracing study horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was injected into different spinal levels, which resulted in large HRP-labeled neurons in the lateral and ventrolateral PAG and the adjacent mesencephalic tegmentum. Even after an injection in the S2 spinal segment a few of these large neurons were found in the PAG. Wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated HRP injections in the ventrolateral and lateral PAG resulted in anterogradely labeled fibers descending through the ventromedial, ventral, and lateral funiculi. These fibers terminated in lamina VIII and the medial part of lamina VII of the caudal cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spinal cord. Interneurons in these laminae have been demonstrated to project to axial and proximal muscle motoneurons. The strongest PAG-spinal projections were to the upper cervical cord, where the fibers terminated in the lateral parts of the intermediate zone (laminae V, VII, and the dorsal part of lamina VIII). These laminae contain the premotor interneurons of the neck muscles. This distribution pattern suggests that the PAG-spinal pathway is involved in the control of neck and back movements.

The process by which target cells acquire retinol is not fully elucidated, although a cell surface receptor for RBP has recently been identified. We show here that retinol is at least an order of magnitude more efficient at blocking the terminal differentiation of cultured normal human keratinocytes when administered as a complex with RBP than when administered free in solution. This inhibition of differentiation by RBP can be reversed by monoclonal antibody P142, reactive toward the RBP-binding membrane protein p63. These results demonstrate, at least in this in vitro system, the importance of the RBP receptor in the generation of a cellular response to retinol.",Regulatory element,retinolbinding protein mediates uptake retinol cultured human keratinocytes retinol vitamin circulates blood bound retinolbinding protein rbp process target cell acquire retinol fully elucidated although cell surface receptor rbp recently identified show retinol least order magnitude efficient blocking terminal differentiation cultured normal human keratinocytes administered complex rbp administered free solution inhibition differentiation rbp reversed monoclonal antibody reactive toward rbpbinding membrane protein result demonstrate least vitro system importance rbp receptor generation cellular response retinol

A total of 79 soft tissue sarcoma patients with frozen tumor tissue and histopathologic slides available for review. The RNA from the tumors was assayed by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. These assays detect PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR chimeric transcripts in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, EWS-FLI1 and EWS-ERG chimeric transcripts in Ewing's sarcoma, and EWS-WT1 chimeric transcripts in desmoplastic small round cell tumor. The polymerase chain reaction findings were compared with cytogenetic and histopathologic results. These assays detected chimeric transcripts in all cases in which translocations were found by standard cytogenetics as well as additional cases without cytogenetically detectable translocations. PAX3-FKHR or PAX7-FKHR fusions were present in 18 of 21 alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, two of 30 embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, and one of seven undifferentiated sarcomas.

7530394,Glycosylation and antigenic variation among Kunjin virus isolates. Previous studies have found Kunjin (KUN) virus isolates from within Australia to be genetically homogenous and that the envelope protein of the type strain (MRM61C) was unglycosylated and lacked a potential glycosylation site. We investigated the extent of antigenic variation between KUN virus isolates from Australia and Sarawak using an immunoperoxidase assay and a panel of six monoclonal antibodies. The glycosylation status of the E protein of each virus was also determined by N glycosidase F (PNGase F) digestion and limited sequence analysis. The results showed that KUN viruses isolated within Australia oscillated between three antigenic types defined by two epitopes whose expression was influenced by passage history and host cell type. In contrast an isolate from Sarawak formed a stable antigenic type that was not influenced by passage history and was distinct from all Australian isolates. PNGase F digestions of KUN isolates indicated that 19 of the 33 viruses possessed a glycosylated E protein. Nucleotide sequence of the 5' third of the E gene of selected KUN isolates revealed that a single base change in PNGase F sensitive strains changed the tripeptide N-Y-F (amino acids 154-156 of the published sequence) to the potential glycosylation site N-Y-S. Further analysis revealed that passage history also had a significant influence on glycosylation.,Regulatory element,glycosylation antigenic variation among kunjin virus isolates previous study found kunjin kun virus isolates within australia genetically homogenous envelope protein type strain mrmc unglycosylated lacked potential glycosylation site investigated extent antigenic variation kun virus isolates australia sarawak using immunoperoxidase assay panel six monoclonal antibody glycosylation status protein virus also determined glycosidase pngase digestion limited sequence analysis result showed kun virus isolated within australia oscillated three antigenic type defined two epitope whose expression influenced passage history host cell type contrast isolate sarawak formed stable antigenic type influenced passage history distinct australian isolates pngase digestion kun isolates indicated virus possessed glycosylated protein nucleotide sequence third gene selected kun isolates revealed single base change pngase sensitive strain changed tripeptide nyf amino acid published sequence potential glycosylation site ny analysis revealed passage history also significant influence glycosylation
7530253,"Identification of the major sites of phosphorylation in IGF binding protein-3. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) is the major carrier of insulin-like growth factor I and II in the circulation. IGFBP-3 is secreted by various tissues and cell lines as a glycosylated phosphoprotein. We have identified two major serine phosphorylation sites located at amino acids 111 and 113 of the human protein. These serine residues and neighboring amino acids potentially involved in defining a protein kinase recognition sequence were mutated to alanine using PCR. Single and double point mutants were stably transfected into CHO-cells and analyzed for their level of phosphorylation. Mutation of both serines reduced phosphorylation by > 80% in the full-length protein and completely abolished phosphorylation in a 17 kDa IGFBP-3 fragment, derived from digestion with EndoProteinase Lys-C. The 17 kDa fragment contained serines 111 and 113. S111A/S113A, a double serine-to-alanine mutant at positions 111 and 113, showed a strongly reduced glycosylation pattern that appears to be the result of amino acid substitutions rather than lack of phosphorylation. Mutant S111A/S113A, despite being non-phosphorylated and non-glycosylated, is functionally similar to the wild-type IGFBP-3 in terms of IGF-I binding.

7527760,"Porcine-derived lung surfactant. A review of the therapeutic efficacy and clinical tolerability of a natural surfactant preparation (Curosurf) in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Porcine-derived lung surfactant (PLS; Curosurf) has shown efficacy in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. PLS consists of phospholipids, mainly dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, the primary surface-active agent of natural lung surfactant, and pulmonary surfactant-associated proteins which facilitate spreading and adsorption of the surface-active agent at the air-alveolar interface. Intratracheal administration of a single dose of PLS 200 mg/kg significantly improves the survival rate and reduces the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 28 days in premature infants (birthweight 700 to 2000g) with severe respiratory distress syndrome (fraction of inspired oxygen > or = 0.60). PLS also reduces the incidence of air leak events such as pulmonary interstitial emphysema and pneumothorax. The response rate may be further improved by administration of additional 100 mg/kg doses at 12-hour intervals to infants showing a poor response or relapse after a single dose. PLS prophylaxis reduces the incidence and severity of respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants at high risk of developing the disease; however, it remains unclear whether the eventual clinical outcome is similar or superior to that observed in infants who receive rescue treatment. PLS is well tolerated and does not appear to increase the incidence of complications of prematurity or respiratory distress syndrome, including patent ductus arteriosus and intraventricular haemorrhage. Although its effect on long term development require further investigation, early indications are that PLS is not associated with any long term adverse sequelae. Comparative trials are clearly warranted to determine the efficacy and tolerability of PLS relative to that of other available surfactant preparations, particularly to explore preliminary indications that a more rapid effect of natural surfactants such as PLS (compared with synthetic products) may correlate with improved clinical outcomes, and that PLS may result in fewer complications than synthetic preparations. Thus, available data show PLS to be a very effective agent for the treatment and prophylaxis of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, and that it may have some advantages over synthetic preparations.",Regulatory element,porcinederived lung surfactant review therapeutic efficacy clinical tolerability natural surfactant preparation curosurf neonatal respiratory distress syndrome porcinederived lung surfactant pls curosurf shown efficacy neonatal respiratory distress syndrome pls consists phospholipid mainly dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine primary surfaceactive agent natural lung surfactant pulmonary surfactantassociated protein facilitate spreading adsorption surfaceactive agent airalveolar interface intratracheal administration single dose pls mgkg significantly improves survival rate reduces incidence bronchopulmonary dysplasia day premature infant birthweight severe respiratory distress syndrome fraction inspired oxygen pls also reduces incidence air leak event pulmonary interstitial emphysema pneumothorax response rate may improved administration additional mgkg dos hour interval infant showing poor response relapse single dose pls prophylaxis reduces incidence severity respiratory distress syndrome premature infant high risk developing disease however remains unclear whether eventual clinical outcome similar superior observed infant receive rescue treatment pls well tolerated appear increase incidence complication prematurity respiratory distress syndrome including patent ductus arteriosus intraventricular haemorrhage although effect long term development require investigation early indication pls associated long term adverse sequela comparative trial clearly warranted determine efficacy tolerability pls relative available surfactant preparation particularly explore preliminary indication rapid effect natural surfactant pls compared synthetic product may correlate improved clinical outcome pls may result fewer complication synthetic preparation thus available data show pls effective agent treatment prophylaxis neonatal respiratory distress syndrome may advantage synthetic preparation

Antibodies to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein are present in the majority of patients with chronic HCV infection. To characterize the corresponding determinants, synthetic peptides and various deletion clones of the core gene expressed in Escherichia coli were used to test human anti-core positive sera or rabbit anti-peptide antibodies in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, immunoblots, and competition assays. Two distinct linear antigenic determinants which are located within aa 1 to 20 and between aa 30 and 47 were found. Further studies using reactive serum after preabsorption of antibodies with N- and C-terminal-deleted HCV core proteins or with peptides directed to the linear epitopes revealed an additional determinant that requires for presentation the participation of the N-terminal 69 amino acids.

7520597,"[Proper use of prostate specific antigen]. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) has become the best marker for prostatic carcinoma. PSA is secreted by the glandular cells of prostatic epithelium and is specific for any normal, hyperplasic and tumoral prostatic tissue. PSA is excreted in blood that render its dosage accessible for clinical purpose. Two different tests are now used: Tandem test R is a radioimmunological test (N1:0-4 ng/mL), and Pros check test uses an immunoenzymatic method and is considered to be more sensitive (N1: < 2.5 ng/mL). PSA increases of 35 ng/mL for every other gram of hyperplastic prostatic tissue and of 3.5 ng/mL by gram of prostatic cancer. This test allows detection of prostate carcinoma with a positive predictive value of 49% when PSA > 4 ng/mL and 75% when PSA > 10 ng/mL. However, only biopsies will confirm the diagnostic of prostate cancer. For the patients with an increased PSA and no cancer founded by random biopsies, an increase of PSA level in the next year suggests prostate carcinoma. When the diagnostic of prostate cancer has been made, a PSA < 15 ng/mL suggests a low stage carcinoma (B1 or B2). When PSA > 75 ng/mL, there is a high probability that this cancer is node positive. Between this values, PSA cannot make the difference between stage B, C or D. The more sensitive test (Pros check) must give undetectable level after radical prostatectomy.

7520596,"[Surgical treatment of prostate cancer]. Surgical treatment of prostatic carcinoma is used at the two extremities of the course of the disease. In the initial stage when the tumour is confined to the prostate, radical prostatectomy entails the best prognosis for cure by removal of the tumour, at the cost of slight morbidity, particularly the risk of subsequent impotence. However, the volume of the tumour often is greatly underestimated and the surgical excision does not reach healthy tissue in almost one out of two cases; in this case, it cannot be considered fully curative. Surgery has an important role in the metastatic phase, either as hormonal treatment (surgical castration) or with the aim of re-establishing urine flux (transurethral prostatic resection or urine derivation).",Regulatory element,surgical treatment prostate cancer surgical treatment prostatic carcinoma used two extremity course disease initial stage tumour confined prostate radical prostatectomy entail best prognosis cure removal tumour cost slight morbidity particularly risk subsequent impotence however volume tumour often greatly underestimated surgical excision reach healthy tissue almost one two case case considered fully curative surgery important role metastatic phase either hormonal treatment surgical castration aim reestablishing urine flux transurethral prostatic resection urine derivation

The equine-1 influenza virus A/Cornell/74 (H7N7) hemagglutinin (HA) is cleaved to HA1 and HA2 in the trans Golgi network (TGN) of infected cells. The avian influenza virus A/chicken/Germany/34 (fowl plague virus Rostock) H7 HA is also cleaved to HA1 and HA2 intracellularly in the TGN. To maintain the fowl plague virus Rostock HA in its native form during transport through the TGN, a functioning M2 ion channel activity is required, otherwise the HA undergoes its transition to the low-pH form (Sugrue et al., 1990, EMBO J. 9, 3469-3476). Studies were initiated to investigate if the equine H7 HA has intracellular requirements different from those of the fowl plague virus Rostock HA. We report here that the pH of transition to the low-pH form of the equine-1 HA is approximately pH 5.3 and that the M2 protein ion channel blocker, amantadine, does not have a discernable effect on the native conformation of equine-1 HA during transport through the TGN.

7517561,"Paradoxical fate and biological action of peroxynitrite on human platelets. Peroxynitrite (ONOO-), which is formed from the reaction of nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O2-), has been suggested to be responsible for some of the cytotoxic effects of these molecules. When protonated, ONOO- gives rise to hydroxyl (OH.) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) radicals, which are capable of inducing tissue damage. We have investigated the effects of ONOO- on human platelets in vitro in order to explore the potential of this oxidant to contribute to tissue damage. ONOO- caused aggregation of washed platelets and reversed the inhibition of aggregation induced by S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP), prostacyclin, and indomethacin. However, in platelet-rich plasma, ONOO- not only did not possess proaggregatory properties but acted as an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. This reversal of the aggregatory effect of ONOO- could also be achieved in washed platelets by adding low concentrations of plasma, human serum albumin, or glutathione and was inhibited by hemoglobin. An analysis of the reaction products of ONOO- and glutathione revealed the presence of both NO and S-nitrosoglutathione in quantities sufficient to account for the antiaggregatory effects observed. Thus the fate and therefore the actions of ONOO- in biological systems are critically dependent on the biological environment in which this oxidant is present.",Regulatory element,paradoxical fate biological action peroxynitrite human platelet peroxynitrite onoo formed reaction nitric oxide superoxide suggested responsible cytotoxic effect molecule protonated onoo give rise hydroxyl oh nitrogen dioxide radical capable inducing tissue damage investigated effect onoo human platelet vitro order explore potential oxidant contribute tissue damage onoo caused aggregation washed platelet reversed inhibition aggregation induced snitrosonacetyldlpenicillamine snap prostacyclin indomethacin however plateletrich plasma onoo posse proaggregatory property acted inhibitor platelet aggregation reversal aggregatory effect onoo also achieved washed platelet adding low concentration plasma human serum albumin glutathione inhibited hemoglobin analysis reaction product onoo glutathione revealed presence snitrosoglutathione quantity sufficient account antiaggregatory effect observed thus fate therefore action onoo biological system critically dependent biological environment oxidant present

TH1 cytokine secretion was examined in response to synthetic peptides of the 85A component of the major secreted, fibronectin-binding antigen 85 complex from Mycobacterium tuberculosis in seven different mouse strains infected with live M. bovis BCG. Twenty-eight overlapping 20-mer peptides covering the complete mature 295-amino-acid (AA) protein were synthesized. Significant interleukin-2 (IL-2) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) secretion could be measured following in vitro stimulation of spleen cells with these peptides. H-2d haplotype mice reacted preferentially against the amino-terminal half of the protein, i.e., against peptide 5 (AA 41 to 60) and especially against peptide 11 (AA 101 to 120), which contained an I-Ed binding motif. H-2b haplotype mice, on the other hand, reacted against peptides from both amino- and carboxy-terminal halves of the protein, peptide 25 (AA 241 to 260) being the most potent stimulator of IL-2 and IFN-gamma production. (BALB/c x C57BL/6)F1 animals with the H-2d/b haplotype weakly recognized peptides specific for both parental lines. Finally, CBA/J (H-2k) and major histocompatibility complex class II mutant B6.C.bm12 mice, carrying a mutant I-A beta bm12 allele on an H-2b background, reacted only very weakly to the 85A peptides.

7506005,"Twin pregnancies in the second trimester in women in an alpha-fetoprotein screening program: sonographic evaluation and outcome. We correlated sonographic findings with fetal outcomes in women with unsuspected twin pregnancies who had sonography in the second trimester as part of a screening program for maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) level and history of neural tube defect. The study group consisted of 97 women with twin pregnancies who participated in a screening program for MSAFP level and history of neural tube defect. Seventy-three had normal MSAFP levels, 21 had elevated MSAFP levels, and two had low MSAFP levels. One patient had a family history of anencephaly. All 97 patients had sonography during their second trimester of pregnancy. Sonographic findings were reviewed retrospectively for information on gestational age, fetal anomalies, sex of the fetus, location of the placenta, presence and thickness of a dividing membrane, and interpretation of amnionicity and chorionicity. Information on fetal outcome included gestational age at delivery, survival, birth weight, sex, congenital anomalies, obstetric complications, amnionicity, chorionicity, and placental abnormalities. Amnionicity and chorionicity were correctly detected on sonograms in 44 (90%) of 49 diamniotic-dichorionic gestations, 23 (72%) of 32 diamniotic-monochorionic gestations, and two (50%) of four monoamniotic-monochorionic gestations. Fetal anomalies were present at delivery in five neonates and had been correctly detected at sonography in one (hemivertebra); one fetus with duodenal atresia had abnormal sonographic findings in the third trimester. Missed anomalies included absent forearm, cleft lip and palate, and imperforate anus. Sex of the fetuses was correctly predicted on the basis of sonographic findings in 40 of 43 pairs. Nine twin pairs had possible twin-twin transfusion syndrome suspected sonographically on the basis of abnormal fluid volumes, discrepant growth measurements, and abnormal findings on Doppler studies. Outcomes included two confirmed cases of the syndrome (two survivors, two deaths) and three probable cases (six deaths); four pregnancies resulted in eight survivors who were delivered after 34.4 weeks' gestation and had birth weights in the 25th percentile or higher. Survival rates for diamniotic-dichorionic, diamniotic-monochorionic, and monoamniotic-monochorionic gestations were 90%, 91%, and 50%, respectively. Fetuses in women with MSAFP levels greater than 4.5 multiples of the median and with monochorionic placentation had lower survival rates than fetuses in women with normal MSAFP levels and monochorionic placentation (67% vs 96%). Half the fetuses delivered after 20 weeks' gestation had birth-weight discordance of less than 10%. Premature deliveries occurred in 56% of pregnancies. The results suggest that (1) sonography is useful in predicting placentation, (2) placentation may be helpful in predicting fetal outcome, (3) increased MSAFP levels correlate with increased perinatal mortality in diamniotic-monochorionic pregnancies, and (4) caution should be taken in diagnosing and determining prognosis for suspected twin-twin transfusion syndrome in the second trimester.",Regulatory element,twin pregnancy second trimester woman alphafetoprotein screening program sonographic evaluation outcome correlated sonographic finding fetal outcome woman unsuspected twin pregnancy sonography second trimester part screening program maternal serum alphafetoprotein msafp level history neural tube defect study group consisted woman twin pregnancy participated screening program msafp level history neural tube defect seventythree normal msafp level elevated msafp level two low msafp level one patient family history anencephaly patient sonography second trimester pregnancy sonographic finding reviewed retrospectively information gestational age fetal anomaly sex fetus location placenta presence thickness dividing membrane interpretation amnionicity chorionicity information fetal outcome included gestational age delivery survival birth weight sex congenital anomaly obstetric complication amnionicity chorionicity placental abnormality amnionicity chorionicity correctly detected sonogram diamnioticdichorionic gestation diamnioticmonochorionic gestation two four monoamnioticmonochorionic gestation fetal anomaly present delivery five neonate correctly detected sonography one hemivertebra one fetus duodenal atresia abnormal sonographic finding third trimester missed anomaly included absent forearm cleft lip palate imperforate anus sex fetus correctly predicted basis sonographic finding pair nine twin pair possible twintwin transfusion syndrome suspected sonographically basis abnormal fluid volume discrepant growth measurement abnormal finding doppler study outcome included two confirmed case syndrome two survivor two death three probable case six death four pregnancy resulted eight survivor delivered week gestation birth weight th percentile higher survival rate diamnioticdichorionic diamnioticmonochorionic monoamnioticmonochorionic gestation respectively fetus woman msafp level greater multiple median monochorionic placentation lower survival rate fetus woman normal msafp level monochorionic placentation v half fetus delivered week gestation birthweight discordance le premature delivery occurred pregnancy result suggest sonography useful predicting placentation placentation may helpful predicting fetal outcome increased msafp level correlate increased perinatal mortality diamnioticmonochorionic pregnancy caution taken diagnosing determining prognosis suspected twintwin transfusion syndrome second trimester

To determine the tick species hindering the cattle industry in Costa Rica and to assess infection rates of ticks with three important hemoparasite species, cattle were monitored during a period of six months (October 1992-March 1993). Four farms were located in the dry pacific region of the canton of Tilarán and a fifth farm on the slopes of the Poás volcano in a cool tropical cloud-forest ecosystem. On each farm 3 to 5 animals of 6 to 24 months of age were selected at random. All ticks were removed on a monthly basis from the right half side of each animal, while the site of attachment was recorded. Ticks were counted and differentiated according to species, developmental stage and sex. Moreover, engorged female ticks were assayed for the presence of Babesia bigemina, Babesia bovis and Anaplasma marginale using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) multiplex system. Two species of ticks, Amblyomma cajennense and Boophilus microplus, were encountered on the cattle in the Tilarán region and one species, B. microplus, was detected in the Poás region. Two to ten times as many ticks were encountered in the Tilarán region than in the Poás region, which is in accordance with a stable enzootic protozoan disease situation in the former region and an unstable epizootic situation in the latter region.

The effects of E-4031, a new class III antiarrhythmic agent, on atrial fibrillation threshold (AFT), atrial effective refractory period (ERP), and interatrial conduction time (ACT) were investigated in Langendorff-perfused guinea pig hearts; the results were then compared with those of the class I agents disopyramide, procainamide, lidocaine, and flecainide. Whole guinea pig hearts were perfused with Tyrode's solution containing acetylcholine (ACh 3 x 10(-7) M). The three indexes were measured before and after administration of the test drugs, using right atrial extrastimulus and 50-Hz continuous stimulation. Disopyramide, procainamide, and flecainide (> or = 10(-6) M) significantly increased AFT. Although E-4031 (> or = 3 x 10(-6) M) also increased AFT, this effect was less potent than that observed with the other drugs. E-4031 (> or = 10(-6) M) significantly prolonged ERP, and this prolongation was less pronounced than that observed with disopyramide but similar to that observed with procainamide or flecainide. E-4031 did not affect ACT, and the greatest prolongation of ACT was observed with flecainide. Lidocaine had no effect on any of the indexes.

7528744,"The beta D-sheet residues of the Lck-derived SH2 domain determine specificity of the interaction with tyrosine-phosphorylated ligands in Ramos B cells. Src homology 2 (SH2) domains are noncatalytic regions that are conserved among a group of cellular signaling proteins. SH2 domains share the common property of binding phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. Previously, we showed that SH2 domains expressed as recombinant glutathione S-transferase-fusion proteins (GST-SH2) from GTPase-activating protein, Shc, zeta-chain-associated protein tyrosine kinase Zap-70, and Src-like tyrosine kinases precipitated distinct sets of phospho-proteins from activated B cells. To determine the intrinsic structural motifs responsible for the binding specificity within the different SH2 domains, we created chimeric SH2 domains especially focusing on crystal structure-defined contact residues. Recombinant SH2 domains of Lck, Zap-70, and Shc were tested in Ramos B cell lysates for phosphotyrosine-dependent protein binding.

7528382,"Correlation between urinary flow rate, voided volume, and patient age in a community-based population. This investigation is unique in that is the first study to use a large number of randomly chosen men from the community to establish the relationship between: 1) urinary flow rate and voided volume, 2) urinary flow rate and patient age, 3) voided volume and patient age, and 4) the time to achieve peak urinary flow rate and patient age. The results clearly indicate that both the peak and mean urinary flow rate decreases with advancing age. The voided volume also diminishes with increasing age. The time required to achieve the peak urinary flow rate, however, appears to be independent of the patient's age. Irrespective of age, approximately 9 seconds are required to achieve the maximum urinary flow rate. Because the urinary flow rate is dependent upon both the quantity of urine voided and the patient's age, it is necessary to account for the influence of both parameters when establishing the ""normal range"" for peak urinary flow rate. To this end, nomograms estimating the peak urinary flow rate percentile as a function of voided volume and patient age have been generated and are included in this report. These nomograms, based on a large, randomly selected population, should make peak urinary flow rate a more reliable diagnostic modality for assessing bladder outlet obstruction. They also should be most useful to the practicing clinician when interpreting the results of a peak urinary flow rate determination for a patient presenting with symptoms of prostatism.",Regulatory element,correlation urinary flow rate voided volume patient age communitybased population investigation unique first study use large number randomly chosen men community establish relationship urinary flow rate voided volume urinary flow rate patient age voided volume patient age time achieve peak urinary flow rate patient age result clearly indicate peak mean urinary flow rate decrease advancing age voided volume also diminishes increasing age time required achieve peak urinary flow rate however appears independent patient age irrespective age approximately second required achieve maximum urinary flow rate urinary flow rate dependent upon quantity urine voided patient age necessary account influence parameter establishing normal range peak urinary flow rate end nomogram estimating peak urinary flow rate percentile function voided volume patient age generated included report nomogram based large randomly selected population make peak urinary flow rate reliable diagnostic modality assessing bladder outlet obstruction also useful practicing clinician interpreting result peak urinary flow rate determination patient presenting symptom prostatism
7528078,"A noninvasive method for recording the electrical activity of the human uterus in vivo. Development of an electrohysterograph (EHG) for recording the electrical activity of the uterus in vivo has been blocked for 60 years by problems with artifacts and extraneous/reactive electrical activity. This study reevaluates a method of cervical recording that does not appear to have these limitations. A set of cervical electrode cups was used to record uterine activity of 33 normal subjects and patients who had dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, or chronic pelvic pain. The electrode cups were atraumatic, able to be fitted to all subjects, and showed exceptional positional stability. Unipolar and bipolar recordings from the cervix showed the same infrequent spikes and spike bursts reported from other studies along with continuous, mildly irregular, undulating slow-wave activity, which was present throughout the recordings. The frequencies and amplitudes of these slow waves changed in relation to exogenous estrogen, diagnosis, intrauterine catheters, and the intensity of the subject's pain. Spikes and spike bursts were common only during menses and at midcycle. The cervical electrode cups proved easy to use and were well accepted by the subjects. The findings indicated that the spikes and slow waves were probably uterine in origin and not artifact or extraneous/reactive activity. There were also direct and indirect indications that the slow waves may represent the ionic propagation of uterine electrophysiologic activity through a network of uterine intercellular ionic channels (gap junctions). The limited but fairly consistent evidence from a number of perspectives indicates that recording spike and slow-wave activity from the cervix is a viable and practical EHG method.",Regulatory element,noninvasive method recording electrical activity human uterus vivo development electrohysterograph ehg recording electrical activity uterus vivo blocked year problem artifact extraneousreactive electrical activity study reevaluates method cervical recording appear limitation set cervical electrode cup used record uterine activity normal subject patient dysmenorrhea endometriosis chronic pelvic pain electrode cup atraumatic able fitted subject showed exceptional positional stability unipolar bipolar recording cervix showed infrequent spike spike burst reported study along continuous mildly irregular undulating slowwave activity present throughout recording frequency amplitude slow wave changed relation exogenous estrogen diagnosis intrauterine catheter intensity subject pain spike spike burst common menses midcycle cervical electrode cup proved easy use well accepted subject finding indicated spike slow wave probably uterine origin artifact extraneousreactive activity also direct indirect indication slow wave may represent ionic propagation uterine electrophysiologic activity network uterine intercellular ionic channel gap junction limited fairly consistent evidence number perspective indicates recording spike slowwave activity cervix viable practical ehg method

The decapeptide 810 (QDLTMKYQIF) contains the antigenic epitope (KYQI) recognized by human mAb L92. This sequence is found in a 43-kDa protein associated with human melanoma M14. We examined the expression of 810 in human cells and its involvement in the cellular immune responses of melanoma patients. Nineteen stage III melanoma patients and 19 normal donors were studied for their responses to 810. All patients were immunized in vivo with an allogeneic melanoma cell vaccine. PBMC cytotoxicity was tested on autologous EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (BCL) pulsed with 810 and autologous melanomas. Proliferative responses of PBMC to 810 were evaluated by using [3H]Tdr incorporation assays. Western blotting revealed that the 43-kDa protein was not specific to melanoma but was common to various cells. However, the percentage of cytotoxicity of PBMC against autologous 810-pulsed BCL was significantly greater in melanoma patients than in normal controls (p < 0.005). Cytotoxicity was increased after melanoma cell vaccine immunization in 15 patients (78%). Proliferative responses to 810 were observed only in melanoma patients and were enhanced in 12 patients (63%) after vaccination. Restimulation of PBMC from vaccinated patients with 810 increased cytotoxicity against both autologous 810-pulsed BCL and melanomas. These targets were lysed by CD8+ T lymphocytes in an HLA class I-restricted manner. HLA-A2 and -A11 seemed to serve as the 810-presenting molecule.

7523403,"Interleukin-6 signaling via four transcription factors binding palindromic enhancers of different genes. Interferons (IFNs), as well as some interleukins, growth factors, and hormones, all induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and additional transcription factors of similar sizes. These factors are activated to translocate to nucleus and bind to enhancers of consensus sequence TTnCnnnAA (gamma-IFN activated sequence-like enhancers). In mammary cells or hybridoma B9 cells, four distinct tyrosine-phosphorylated transcription complexes activated by interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IFN-beta were observed: pIRFA and complexes I, II, and III (of increasing electrophoretic mobility). The factors have unequal affinities for enhancers of different genes; they are activated with distinct kinetics and to different extents by IL-6 and IFNs. The pIRFA band isolated from IL-6-stimulated B9 hybridoma cells revealed three DNA-interacting components: two large subunits of 91 and 98 kDa, as well as a small component of 46 kDa not seen in other complexes analyzed. One of the large pIRFA subunits may be APRF/STAT3, since pIRFA reacted with anti-APRF antibodies as do complexes I and II. However, pIRFA did not react with antibodies to STAT1, indicating STAT1 is not the other large component of pIRFA. Complex II, which reacted to anti-acute phase response factor antibodies also reacted to anti-STAT1 antibodies, whereas complex III reacted only to anti-STAT1 and was the only complex resistant to N-ethylmaleimide. By its multimeric subunit structure and its cytokine and enhancer sequence specificities, the slowly migrating pIRFA band appears as a novel tyrosine-phosphorylated transcription complex acting on a subset of gamma-IFN activated sequence-like enhancers.",Regulatory element,interleukin signaling via four transcription factor binding palindromic enhancer different gene interferon ifns well interleukin growth factor hormone induce tyrosine phosphorylation stat additional transcription factor similar size factor activated translocate nucleus bind enhancer consensus sequence ttncnnnaa gammaifn activated sequencelike enhancer mammary cell hybridoma cell four distinct tyrosinephosphorylated transcription complex activated interleukin il ifnbeta observed pirfa complex ii iii increasing electrophoretic mobility factor unequal affinity enhancer different gene activated distinct kinetics different extent il ifns pirfa band isolated ilstimulated hybridoma cell revealed three dnainteracting component two large subunit kda well small component kda seen complex analyzed one large pirfa subunit may aprfstat since pirfa reacted antiaprf antibody complex ii however pirfa react antibody stat indicating stat large component pirfa complex ii reacted antiacute phase response factor antibody also reacted antistat antibody whereas complex iii reacted antistat complex resistant nethylmaleimide multimeric subunit structure cytokine enhancer sequence specificity slowly migrating pirfa band appears novel tyrosinephosphorylated transcription complex acting subset gammaifn activated sequencelike enhancer
7522891,"The use of G-CSF or GM-CSF mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) alone or to augment marrow as hematologic support of single or multiple cycle high-dose chemotherapy. High dose chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow support (ABMT) can achieve prolonged relapse-free survival in relapsed lymphomas, leukemias, and certain solid tumors. The principal morbidity and mortality relate to the infectious complications that occur during the 3-4 week aplasia until the marrow autograft recovers. Progenitor cells can be mobilized into the peripheral blood compartment by hematopoietic growth factors, used alone or after chemotherapy. We describe four trials using cytokine-mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). In the first trial, PBPC collected after GM-CSF administration were used to augment marrow. Reconstitution of trilineage marrow function occurred promptly, resulting in short hospital stays and fewer platelet transfusions. In a second study, GM-CSF/chemotherapy-mobilized PBPC were used as the sole hematopoietic support during high dose chemotherapy. Granulocyte and platelet reconstitution was rapid. Time to hematopoietic recovery, transfusion requirements, and duration of hospital stay were all significantly improved for the patients receiving PBPC compared with similar patients receiving marrow alone. While most patients experienced prompt hematopoietic recovery they showed sluggish platelet engraftment. The next two trials built on the observation that a few PBPC alone could support both granulocyte and platelet recovery and were designed to test the feasibility of sequential high-dose therapies. In one trial, PBPC given with and without marrow made it possible to deliver two sequential cycles of high-dose therapy. The second trial utilized PBPC plus cytokines to deliver four cycles of dose-intensive chemotherapy at doses that could not be given with cytokine support alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Regulatory element,use gcsf gmcsf mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cell pbpc alone augment marrow hematologic support single multiple cycle highdose chemotherapy high dose chemotherapy autologous bone marrow support abmt achieve prolonged relapsefree survival relapsed lymphoma leukemia certain solid tumor principal morbidity mortality relate infectious complication occur week aplasia marrow autograft recovers progenitor cell mobilized peripheral blood compartment hematopoietic growth factor used alone chemotherapy describe four trial using cytokinemobilized peripheral blood progenitor cell pbpc first trial pbpc collected gmcsf administration used augment marrow reconstitution trilineage marrow function occurred promptly resulting short hospital stay fewer platelet transfusion second study gmcsfchemotherapymobilized pbpc used sole hematopoietic support high dose chemotherapy granulocyte platelet reconstitution rapid time hematopoietic recovery transfusion requirement duration hospital stay significantly improved patient receiving pbpc compared similar patient receiving marrow alone patient experienced prompt hematopoietic recovery showed sluggish platelet engraftment next two trial built observation pbpc alone support granulocyte platelet recovery designed test feasibility sequential highdose therapy one trial pbpc given without marrow made possible deliver two sequential cycle highdose therapy second trial utilized pbpc plus cytokine deliver four cycle doseintensive chemotherapy dos given cytokine support aloneabstract truncated word

7520897,"Epitope specificity of HLA class I alloantibodies. I. Frequency analysis of antibodies to private versus public specificities in potential transplant recipients. Sera obtained sequentially from 419 patients awaiting solid organ transplantation were screened and analyzed for HLA class I epitope specificity. Antibodies detected in each serum were defined as ""private"" if reactivity could only be demonstrated against a single specificity within one of the eight major CREGs, or as ""public"" if reactivity in a serum could be demonstrated against two or more specificities within a single CREG. A total of 139 sera contained % PRA > 0, in which 147 specific antibodies were identified. Of the 103 positive sera, 93 (90%) contained antipublic antibodies, with or without additional antiprivate antibodies, whereas just 10 (10%) sera contained only apparent antiprivate antibodies. The success rate in defining antibody specificities was low at PRA values of 1%-20% due to weak reactivity and high false-positive rates. Specificity analysis with high test sensitivity and specificity was achieved with PRA values between 40% and 80%. At PRA values > 80%, test sensitivity remained high but specificity declined. We conclude that most anti-HLA antibodies are directed against high frequency public epitope clusters (CREGs), and highly sensitized patients develop antibodies in a fairly predictable fashion, a feature that significantly improved the success rate of specificity analysis. Since high frequency antipublic antibodies are common sequelae of CREG mismatches, further definition of HLA class I public epitopes eventually may be important in donor-recipient matching.",Regulatory element,epitope specificity hla class alloantibody frequency analysis antibody private versus public specificity potential transplant recipient serum obtained sequentially patient awaiting solid organ transplantation screened analyzed hla class epitope specificity antibody detected serum defined private reactivity demonstrated single specificity within one eight major cregs public reactivity serum demonstrated two specificity within single creg total serum contained pra specific antibody identified positive serum contained antipublic antibody without additional antiprivate antibody whereas serum contained apparent antiprivate antibody success rate defining antibody specificity low pra value due weak reactivity high falsepositive rate specificity analysis high test sensitivity specificity achieved pra value pra value test sensitivity remained high specificity declined conclude antihla antibody directed high frequency public epitope cluster cregs highly sensitized patient develop antibody fairly predictable fashion feature significantly improved success rate specificity analysis since high frequency antipublic antibody common sequela creg mismatch definition hla class public epitope eventually may important donorrecipient matching

The fate of E-selectin expressed on TNF-activated monolayers of HUVEC was investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cytokine-activated endothelial cells internalized mAb to E-selectin in a very rapid, energy-dependent fashion. By contrast, mAb against ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 remained surface bound. The E-selectin mAb was recovered in intracellular compartments with a tubular morphology, some of which appeared to be interconnected. Cathepsin B, a ubiquitously expressed lysosomal protease, was found to co-localize in these structures. Functional specificity of E-selectin-internalization was observed upon addition of the fluorescent SLex-oligosaccharide to the activated HUVEC monolayers. Uptake into the same E-selectin-positive compartments was observed, whereas the control oligosaccharide Lex was not internalized at all. The process of internalization was found to be unaffected by most inhibitors of protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent PKA, or protein tyrosine kinase activity. Whereas cytochalasin B preincubation of HUVEC failed to inhibit the internalization process, colchicine and vinblastine, reagents that interfere with the metabolism of tubulin, prevented the formation of the elongated structures in which E-selectin would normally be internalized.

One hundred and twenty patients with homozygous beta thalassaemia were selected to determine the clinical effects of certain genetic factors which may modify disease severity. Genetic analysis defined specific beta thalassaemia mutations, the alpha thalassaemia genotype, and the presence of an XmnI restriction enzyme site, associated with increased fetal haemoglobin (HbF) production under certain conditions. Genotypic data with globin chain synthesis were related to the age when regular transfusions began and subsequent pubertal development. This study showed that the major determinants of disease severity in beta thalassaemia were the beta thalassaemia mutations, with co-inheritance of alpha thalassaemia trait and coinheritance of a high HbF determinant acting as ameliorating factors. The presence of an alpha thalassaemia deletion significantly reduced initial disease severity, although the effect on pubertal development was less clear.

7506079,"Synergy between cyclosporin A and a monoclonal antibody to B7 in blocking alloantigen-induced T-cell activation. Costimulatory signals are absolutely required for T-cell activation after T-cell receptor/major histocompatibility complex-peptide interaction. So far, the best-known candidate essential costimulatory signal is mediated by interaction of CD28 on T cells with B7 on antigen-presenting cells. Using an allogeneic B7+ Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell line as stimulator, we found that addition of a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to B7 that efficiently blocks B7-CD28 interaction only partially inhibited proliferation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in primary and secondary mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR), whereas the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) was not affected. Inhibition of primary or secondary MLR-induced T-cell activation with cyclosporin A (CsA) at nontoxic concentrations also was never complete. However, the combination of CsA and anti-B7 MoAb B7-24 synergistically blocked allogeneic B cell-induced T-cell proliferation, IL-2 production, and CTL generation.

While shotgun sequencing infers a DNA sequence given the sequences of overlapping fragments, a recent and complementary method, called sequencing by hybridization (SBH), infers a DNA sequence given the set of oligomers that represents all subwords of some fixed length, k.

7483666,"Central role of radical cations in metabolic activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. 1. Development of the chemistry of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) radical cations has provided evidence that these intermediates play a major role in the metabolism of PAHs by P450 and in their binding to DNA. 2. Fluoro substitution of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) represents a suitable probe for studying mechanisms of oxygen transfer in the P450-catalysed formation of quinones and phenols from BP. Formation of BP-1,6-, -3,6- and -6,12-dione from the metabolism of 6-fluoroBP (6-FBP) is mediated by the intermediate 6-FBP+. Similarly, metabolism of 1-FBP and 3-FBP by rat liver microsomes produces BP-1,6-dione and BP-3,6-dione respectively. These results demonstrate that formation of quinones and phenols occurs via an initial electron transfer from BP to P450 and subsequent transfer of oxygen from the iron-oxo complex of P450 to BP. 3. Radical cations also play a major role in the formation of DNA adducts by the potent carcinogens 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), BP and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DB[a,l]P). In the binding of BP both in vitro and in vivo, 80% of the adducts are formed by one-electron oxidation, namely, 8-(BP-6-yl)guanine (BP-6-C8Gua), BP-6-N7Gua and BP-6-N7adenine (Ade), and are lost from the DNA by depurination. For DB[a,l]P, depurinating adducts formed from the radical cation, DB[a,l]P-10-C8Gua, DB[a,l]P-10-N7Gua, DB[a,l]P-10-N7Ade, and DB[a,l]P-10-N3Ade comprise 50% of the total DNA adducts. For DMBA, 99% of the adducts are depurinating adducts formed from the radical cation, 7-CH3BA-12-CH2-N7Gua and 7-CH3BA-12-CH2-N7Ade. 4. In summary, radical cations of PAHs play a major role in both the metabolism and metabolic activation leading to formation of DNA adducts that are critical in the mechanism of tumour initiation.",Regulatory element,central role radical cation metabolic activation polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon development chemistry polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah radical cation provided evidence intermediate play major role metabolism pahs binding dna fluoro substitution benzoapyrene bp represents suitable probe studying mechanism oxygen transfer pcatalysed formation quinone phenol bp formation bp dione metabolism fluorobp fbp mediated intermediate fbp similarly metabolism fbp fbp rat liver microsome produce bpdione bpdione respectively result demonstrate formation quinone phenol occurs via initial electron transfer bp subsequent transfer oxygen ironoxo complex bp radical cation also play major role formation dna adduct potent carcinogen dimethylbenzaanthracene dmba bp dibenzoalpyrene dbalp binding bp vitro vivo adduct formed oneelectron oxidation namely bpylguanine bpcgua bpngua bpnadenine ade lost dna depurination dbalp depurinating adduct formed radical cation dbalpcgua dbalpngua dbalpnade dbalpnade comprise total dna adduct dmba adduct depurinating adduct formed radical cation chbachngua chbachnade summary radical cation pahs play major role metabolism metabolic activation leading formation dna adduct critical mechanism tumour initiation
7527334,"Expression and regulation of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding protein messenger ribonucleic acid levels in tissues of hypophysectomized rats infused with IGF-I and growth hormone. The expression and regulation of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2), -3, -4, and -5 messages were studied in liver, kidney, spleen, thymus, heart, brain, skeletal muscle, testes, and epididymal (white) adipose tissue (WAT) from hypophysectomized rats infused with saline, recombinant human (rh) IGF-I, or rhGH and compared with tissue messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in age-matched normal rats. The IGF-I message was present in all of these tissues. It was most abundant in liver and WAT, but was barely detectable in kidney, brain, and thymus. GH dependence was most pronounced in liver, skeletal muscle, and WAT and less so in heart, testes, kidney, spleen, and thymus. The IGF-I message in brain was not influenced by hypophysectomy. IGF-I infusion induced a small increase in its own mRNA in skeletal muscle and WAT, whereas it decreased its own message in liver. IGFBPs were expressed in a tissue-specific manner; IGFBP-2 mRNA was most abundant in testes and hypophysectomized liver, IGFBP-3 mRNA was most abundant in spleen, kidney, WAT, and liver, IGFBP-4 mRNA was most abundant in liver, and IGFBP-5 mRNA was most abundant in kidney, WAT, and skeletal muscle. After hypophysectomy, significant decreases in IGFBP expression were observed in liver (except IGFBP-2), skeletal muscle, brain, WAT (except IGFBP-4), and testes (except IGFBP-2), in contrast to heart, kidney, spleen, and thymus. GH infusion did not affect IGFBP-2 mRNA levels in liver (in contrast to IGF-I infusion) or brain. Like GH, IGF-I normalized IGFBP-3 mRNA levels in liver, but, in contrast to GH, had no effect on IGFBP-5 mRNA in WAT. It was considerably less effective than GH in raising IGFBP-5 mRNA levels in skeletal muscle. Thus, GH infusion can exert different effects on IGF-I and IGFBP expression than infused rhIGF-I.

Initial definitions of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) were often broad enough to include almost any acquired polyneuropathy with demyelinating features. However, subdivision of acquired demyelinating polyneuropathies into different categories seems justified because 1) several distinct clinical syndromes have been identified, 2) characteristic and distinctive patterns of serum antibody binding are associated with each specific clinical syndrome and, 3) the syndromes respond differently to immune modulating treatments (Table 1).

We studied the expression of bcl-2 oncoprotein in the gerbil hippocampus after transient ischemia. Immunostaining using monoclonal antibody raised against bcl-2 oncoprotein revealed intense immunoreactivity in the CA1 area following 2 min of ischemia, which induced tolerance to subsequent ischemia and prevented delayed neuronal death (DND). Following ischemia for 5 min, however, bcl-2 oncoprotein immunoreactivity was decreased, reflecting neuronal death in the CA1 area. However, pretreatment with ischemia of 2 min that prevented DND due to subsequent ischemia for 5 min, showed increased immunoreactivity. On the other hand, following 1 min of ischemia which failed to induce tolerance, no increase in the bcl-2 oncoprotein was observed.

We report two cases of extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma revealed by large volume thoracic tumour lesions, occurring in a clinical context of an alteration in general health. The tumour mass was occupying the upper half of the left hemithorax, and was invading the thoracic wall posteriorly in the first case; it occupied the whole of the right hemithorax with invasion of the first three ribs in the second case. The first patient received five treatments with chemotherapy, using cyclophosphamide in association with adriamycin, which led to a partial response and was completed with surgical excision and a further five doses of chemotherapy using cyclophosphamide in association with etoposide. Subsequently radiotherapy was given. There was an unfavorable outcome, with recurrence in the 13th month. The second patient received three courses of chemotherapy using cyclophosphamide in association with actinomycin D and vincristine, which allowed for an 80% reduction in the tumour volume. Surgical resection was then carried out, followed by five courses with the same chemotherapy protocol. Forty-two months after the diagnosis this patient remained in complete remission.

7525241,"Quantitative surface EMG of pericranial muscles in headache. A population study. Quantitative EMG from the right frontal and both temporal muscles was studied in 547 adults randomly selected from the general population. The study was part of a multifaceted, epidemiological study of different headache disorders. Surface EMG was recorded by an observer blinded to the persons' history of headache, previous illness and mental state. The present study provides data on amplitude and mean and median frequency levels in migraine and tension-type headache. Chronic headache sufferers had higher amplitude values at rest in their temporal muscles than migraineurs, subjects with episodic tension-type headache and subjects without any experience of headache, probably due to insufficient relaxation. Frequency values during maximal voluntary contraction were decreased in chronic headache subjects and decreased with increasing frequency of headache in the previous year, indicating that chronic fatigue and/or changed fiber type composition exist in frequent headache sufferers. During experimental cold and pain stimulation no significant differences between headache subjects and the rest of the population were detected. Only subjects without any experience of headache had increased amplitude values during pain stimulation. No significant relation of amplitude values to frequency of tension-type headache or migraine in the previous year was detected. In 66 subjects with actual headache amplitude values were increased in the frontal muscle during rest indicating increased tension. Moreover, amplitude values were decreased in both the temporal and the frontal muscles during maximal voluntary contraction indicating submaximal contraction during pain. The present study supports the importance of peripheral factors such as increased fatigability, morphological, and/or metabolic changes in the pathogenesis of tension-type headache.

Thirty-eight volunteers were randomized to receive 0 micrograms, 30 micrograms, or 300 micrograms per day. Baseline neutrophil counts (ANC), peak ANCs, and the rate of attaining the peak ANC were similar in both age groups at both doses. The peak ANC was increased 5-fold at 30 micrograms and 15-fold at 300 micrograms in both the young and elderly. Daily tests of PMN function, as measured by an automated chemiluminescence system, showed nearly identical responses to several agonists for both age groups. Marrow proliferative activity as reflected by the percentage of cells in the marrow neutrophil mitotic pool also increased similarly for both age groups at both doses. In contrast, there was an age-related change in blood colony formation as measured by the blood CFU-GM assay.

7518705,"250-GHz electron spin resonance studies of polarity gradients along the aliphatic chains in phospholipid membranes. Rigid-limit 250-GHz electron spin resonance (FIR-ESR) spectra have been studied for a series of phosphatidylcholine spin labels (n-PC, where n = 5, 7, 10, 12, 16) in pure lipid dispersions of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), as well as dispersions of DPPC containing the peptide gramicidin A (GA) in a 1:1 molar ratio. The enhanced g-tensor resolution of 250-GHz ESR for these spin labels permitted a careful study of the nitroxide g-tensor as a function of spin probe location and membrane composition. In particular, as the spin label is displaced from the polar head group, Azz decreases and gxx increases as they assume values typical of a nonpolar environment, appropriate for the hydrophobic alkyl chains in the case of pure lipid dispersions. The field shifts of spectral features due to changes in gxx are an order of magnitude larger than those from changes in Azz. The magnetic tensor parameters measured in the presence of GA were characteristic of a polar environment and showed only a very weak dependence of Azz and gxx on label position. These results demonstrate the significant influence of GA on the local polarity along the lipid molecule, and may reflect increased penetration of water into the alkyl chain region of the lipid in the presence of GA. The spectra from the pure lipid dispersions also exhibit a broad background signal that is most significant for 7-, 10-, and 12-PC, and is more pronounced in DPPC than in POPC. It is attributed to spin probe aggregation yielding spin exchange narrowing. The addition of GA to DPPC essentially suppressed the broad background signal observed in pure DPPC dispersions.",Regulatory element,ghz electron spin resonance study polarity gradient along aliphatic chain phospholipid membrane rigidlimit ghz electron spin resonance firesr spectrum studied series phosphatidylcholine spin label npc pure lipid dispersion dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine dppc palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine popc well dispersion dppc containing peptide gramicidin ga molar ratio enhanced gtensor resolution ghz esr spin label permitted careful study nitroxide gtensor function spin probe location membrane composition particular spin label displaced polar head group azz decrease gxx increase assume value typical nonpolar environment appropriate hydrophobic alkyl chain case pure lipid dispersion field shift spectral feature due change gxx order magnitude larger change azz magnetic tensor parameter measured presence ga characteristic polar environment showed weak dependence azz gxx label position result demonstrate significant influence ga local polarity along lipid molecule may reflect increased penetration water alkyl chain region lipid presence ga spectrum pure lipid dispersion also exhibit broad background signal significant pc pronounced dppc popc attributed spin probe aggregation yielding spin exchange narrowing addition ga dppc essentially suppressed broad background signal observed pure dppc dispersion
7514027,"p53 immunohistochemical analysis in breast cancer with four monoclonal antibodies: comparison of staining and PCR-SSCP results. The expression of p53 protein was examined in a series of 136 primary breast carcinomas, 106 of which were analysed with a panel of four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs 1801, 240, DO7 and DO1). p53 expression was detected with at least one antibody in 40 tumours (38%), whereas only 15 tumours (14%) were positive with all four antibodies. Some variability in the immunostaining could be observed depending on the antibody used. This was noticeable both for the number of positive cells within a section and for the intensity of staining. We therefore selected a panel of 17 tumour sections (nine were highly positive, three with medium to low staining and five with low to negative staining), which we analysed by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (PCR-SSCP) for the presence of a p53 mutation at the molecular level. Mutations were identified in 15 cases. Therefore the proportion of p53-stained cells does not seem to be an exact representation of the number of cancer cells bearing a mutation within a tumour. A statistically significant correlation was observed between p53 expression, regardless of the number of positive antibodies, and grade III disease (P < 0.0001), oestrogen (P < 0.0001) or progesterone receptor negativity (P = 0.0061), increased Ki 67 index (P = 0.0018), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) positivity (P = 0.0076) and aneuploidy (P = 0.037).

The most robust MAbs were DuPont p24 and Olympus p55, which produced excellent staining regardless of the fixative used. Embedding in paraffin variability influenced the capacity of MAbs to detect HIV-1 epitopes on fixed cells. Certain antibodies (e.g., DuPont gp24, Olympus p24B) produced good staining, whereas other epitopes (e.g., DuPont gp120, formaldehyde) were destroyed. In some cases, paraffin embedding revealed antigenic sites that had been formerly masked (e.g., Olympus gp120 and p24A; formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde fixation).

7543904,"Progesterone receptor does not form oligomeric (8S), non-DNA-binding complex in intact cell nuclei. We raised a polyclonal antibody, alpha D, against a synthetic peptide (amino acids 522-535) of chicken progesterone receptor (PR). The sequence is located between the DNA-binding domain and the hormone-binding domain in the region within the sequences required for stability of the oligomeric form of PR. In the immunoblot, alpha D reacted with both A and B forms of PR. In the sucrose gradient and dot-blot the antibody did not recognize the so-called 8S form of PR, which is an oligomeric complex of PR and other proteins. When the oligomeric complex was dissociated by salt treatment, the antibody recognized the resulting 4S form of PR. This would suggest that the epitope is masked in the 8S form of PR and exposed in the 4S form. To study whether a similar complex exists in vivo, we used the antibody for immunohistochemistry. Two different fixation techniques were employed, freeze-drying-vapor fixation and liquid fixation. In the animals not treated with progesterone, intensive nuclear staining was detected independent of the fixation technique. When receptor from similarly treated animals was analyzed by sucrose gradient, all of the receptor molecules were in the oligomeric complex (8S). Ligand binding is known to promote a dissociation of this complex. Thus progesterone treatment should lead to an increased immunodetection of the epitope; however, progesterone treatment decreased the intensity of PR immunostaining. These results suggest that the oligomeric complex (8S), present in tissue extracts, does not exist in intact cell nuclei. They also call into question the proposed role of hsp90 in regulating progesterone receptor function.",Sequence,progesterone receptor form oligomeric nondnabinding complex intact cell nucleus raised polyclonal antibody alpha synthetic peptide amino acid chicken progesterone receptor pr sequence located dnabinding domain hormonebinding domain region within sequence required stability oligomeric form pr immunoblot alpha reacted form pr sucrose gradient dotblot antibody recognize socalled form pr oligomeric complex pr protein oligomeric complex dissociated salt treatment antibody recognized resulting form pr suggest epitope masked form pr exposed form study whether similar complex exists vivo used antibody immunohistochemistry two different fixation technique employed freezedryingvapor fixation liquid fixation animal treated progesterone intensive nuclear staining detected independent fixation technique receptor similarly treated animal analyzed sucrose gradient receptor molecule oligomeric complex ligand binding known promote dissociation complex thus progesterone treatment lead increased immunodetection epitope however progesterone treatment decreased intensity pr immunostaining result suggest oligomeric complex present tissue extract exist intact cell nucleus also call question proposed role hsp regulating progesterone receptor function

The efficiency of a freeze-thaw method, a proteinase K/Tween 20 lysis method and a guanidinium isothiocyanate/silica beads method for DNA extraction from fixed and Papanicolaou-stained cells from the cervical cancer cell line Siha was measured by beta-globin polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The GTC/silica beads method, which appeared superior, revealed a human papillomavirus (HPV) general primer-mediated PCR sensitivity of 50-500 copies of HPV 16 per sample using dilutions of fixed and stained Siha cells. Application to archival cervical smears (n = 116) revealed that the yield and size of amplifiable DNA decreases with storage time. The longer the storage time, the more repetitions of the whole procedure, including the lysis step, were required to extract sufficient amplifiable DNA. In this way, an overall beta-globin PCR positivity for 98% of the smears was reached. Further analysis revealed that a maximum size of 200 bp could be amplified from smears stored for up to 9 years. The method was validated by demonstrating by PCR the same HPV types in archival smears and corresponding cervical biopsies of cervical cancer patients. In conclusion, the GTC/silica beads method appears suitable to process archival cervical smears for HPV detection by PCR. provided that stepwise adjustments are made until beta-globin PCR positivity is obtained and primers are chosen which amplify a maximum of about 200 bp.",Sequence,processing longstored archival cervical smear human papillomavirus detection polymerase chain reaction efficiency freezethaw method proteinase ktween lysis method guanidinium isothiocyanatesilica bead method dna extraction fixed papanicolaoustained cell cervical cancer cell line siha measured betaglobin polymerase chain reaction pcr gtcsilica bead method appeared superior revealed human papillomavirus hpv general primermediated pcr sensitivity copy hpv per sample using dilution fixed stained siha cell application archival cervical smear revealed yield size amplifiable dna decrease storage time longer storage time repetition whole procedure including lysis step required extract sufficient amplifiable dna way overall betaglobin pcr positivity smear reached analysis revealed maximum size bp amplified smear stored year method validated demonstrating pcr hpv type archival smear corresponding cervical biopsy cervical cancer patient conclusion gtcsilica bead method appears suitable process archival cervical smear hpv detection pcr provided stepwise adjustment made betaglobin pcr positivity obtained primer chosen amplify maximum bp

7543190,"Evidence for 5-HT4 receptor subtype involvement in the enhancement of striatal dopamine release induced by serotonin: a microdialysis study in the halothane-anesthetized rat. The present study, using the in vivo intracerebral microdialysis method, investigated the role of different serotonin receptor subtypes in the control of dopamine (DA) release exerted by serotonin (5-HT) in the striatum of halothane-anesthetized rats. Striatal dialysate DA content was reduced following the blockade of voltage-dependent Na+ channels by tetrodotoxin or by the removal of Ca2+ from the perfusion medium, and increased following depolarization with K+ ions. These findings demonstrate that under our experimental conditions, DA content reflects the neuronal origin of the neurotransmitter release. Drugs were locally applied by means of the microdialysis probe. One, 2.5 and 5 microM 5-HT significantly enhanced DA release in a concentration-dependent manner up to 157, 253 and 446% of basal values respectively. The effect induced by 1 microM 5-HT was not blocked by 10 microM (-)pindolol, a 5-HT1 receptor antagonist, 1 microM ketanserin or 10 microM cinanserin, both 5-HT2A antagonists. One or 10 microM ondansetron (GR 38032F), a selective 5-HT3 antagonist, were also ineffective. In contrast, 10 or 100 microM DAU 6285, a 5-HT3/4 antagonist, significantly reduced the effect of 5-HT on DA release (-20% and -60% respectively). Moreover, 100 microM BIMU 8, a selective 5-HT4 agonist, enhanced DA release (+85%) and this effect was reduced by 100 microM DAU 6285 (-40%). These results demonstrate that in vivo 5-HT exerts a facilitatory influence on striatal DA release and that the 5-HT4, but not the 5-HT1, 5-HT2 or 5-HT3, receptor subtype is implicated, at least partially, in this effect.",Sequence,evidence ht receptor subtype involvement enhancement striatal dopamine release induced serotonin microdialysis study halothaneanesthetized rat present study using vivo intracerebral microdialysis method investigated role different serotonin receptor subtypes control dopamine da release exerted serotonin ht striatum halothaneanesthetized rat striatal dialysate da content reduced following blockade voltagedependent na channel tetrodotoxin removal ca perfusion medium increased following depolarization ion finding demonstrate experimental condition da content reflects neuronal origin neurotransmitter release drug locally applied mean microdialysis probe one microm ht significantly enhanced da release concentrationdependent manner basal value respectively effect induced microm ht blocked microm pindolol ht receptor antagonist microm ketanserin microm cinanserin hta antagonist one microm ondansetron gr selective ht antagonist also ineffective contrast microm dau ht antagonist significantly reduced effect ht da release respectively moreover microm bimu selective ht agonist enhanced da release effect reduced microm dau result demonstrate vivo ht exerts facilitatory influence striatal da release ht ht ht ht receptor subtype implicated least partially effect

7542764,"Differential regulation of the activity of the 42 kD mitogen activated protein kinase (p42mapk) during enterocyte differentiation in vivo. The family of mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases appear to play a central role in relaying signals generated by receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RPTK) from the cell surface to the nucleus. We previously demonstrated that undifferentiated and mitotically active crypt cells have high levels of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins (DR Burgess, W Jiang, S Mamajiwalla and W Kinsey. 1989. J. Cell Biol., 109: 2139) possibly due to the activation of RPTKs and also have high pp60c-src protein tyrosine kinase activity (CA Cartwright, SN Mamajiwalla, SA Skolnik, W Eckhart and DR Burgess. 1993. Oncogene. 8: 1033) when compared to differentiated, non-mitotic villus cells. Since activation of RPTKs leading to cell proliferation or differentiation involves activation of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway, we chose to determine in this study if the activity of the MAP kinases were also regulated during differentiation of normal adult enterocytes. Our data show that although the 42 kD MAP kinase (p42mapk) was expressed in both crypt and villus cells, it was phosphorylated on tyrosine and active only in the crypt cells. Our data further suggest that p42mapk is inactivated during differentiation, possibly by a protein tyrosine phosphatase. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that p42mapk localized to the nuclei in both undifferentiated and differentiated enterocytes and colocalized with phosphotyrosine containing proteins at the region of the junctional complex. These results suggest that p42mapk and its regulators are tightly controlled during enterocyte differentiation in vivo and implicate p42mapk as a key regulatory molecule in the normal development of the adult intestinal epithelium.",Sequence,differential regulation activity kd mitogen activated protein kinase pmapk enterocyte differentiation vivo family mitogen activated protein map kinase appear play central role relaying signal generated receptor protein tyrosine kinase rptk cell surface nucleus previously demonstrated undifferentiated mitotically active crypt cell high level tyrosine phosphorylated protein dr burgess jiang mamajiwalla kinsey cell biol possibly due activation rptks also high ppcsrc protein tyrosine kinase activity ca cartwright sn mamajiwalla sa skolnik eckhart dr burgess oncogene compared differentiated nonmitotic villus cell since activation rptks leading cell proliferation differentiation involves activation rasmap kinase pathway chose determine study activity map kinase also regulated differentiation normal adult enterocytes data show although kd map kinase pmapk expressed crypt villus cell phosphorylated tyrosine active crypt cell data suggest pmapk inactivated differentiation possibly protein tyrosine phosphatase immunofluorescence study revealed pmapk localized nucleus undifferentiated differentiated enterocytes colocalized phosphotyrosine containing protein region junctional complex result suggest pmapk regulator tightly controlled enterocyte differentiation vivo implicate pmapk key regulatory molecule normal development adult intestinal epithelium

Diabetic patients with sensory neuropathy are predisposed to disorders of the musculoskeletal system. It has been postulated that altered neurogenic inflammation, involving the neuropeptide substance P, may play a part in this phenomenon. We investigated the effect of streptozotocin-induced (STZ) diabetes on the development of an antigenic (mBSA) monoarthritis in the rat with particular reference to changes in substance P levels in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and knee joint synovium. We found that STZ-induced diabetes of 24 weeks duration reduced the substance P content of L4/L5 DRG and knee joint synovial tissue. Induction of mBSA arthritis in diabetic rats resulted in diminished increases in synovial substance P and knee joint swelling compared to non-diabetic arthritic controls. The results show that chronic STZ diabetes reduces neurogenic inflammatory responses in the rat knee which may render the joint more susceptible to arthritic attack.",Sequence,streptozotocininduced diabetes decrease substance level experimental arthritis rat knee diabetic patient sensory neuropathy predisposed disorder musculoskeletal system postulated altered neurogenic inflammation involving neuropeptide substance may play part phenomenon investigated effect streptozotocininduced stz diabetes development antigenic mbsa monoarthritis rat particular reference change substance level dorsal root ganglion drg knee joint synovium found stzinduced diabetes week duration reduced substance content drg knee joint synovial tissue induction mbsa arthritis diabetic rat resulted diminished increase synovial substance knee joint swelling compared nondiabetic arthritic control result show chronic stz diabetes reduces neurogenic inflammatory response rat knee may render joint susceptible arthritic attack
7542741,"Calcineurin, the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, is essential in yeast mutants with cell integrity defects and in mutants that lack a functional vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. Calcineurin is a conserved Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase that plays a critical role in Ca(2+)-mediated signaling in many cells. Yeast cells lacking functional calcineurin (cna1 cna2 or cnb1 mutants) display growth defects under specific environmental conditions, for example, in the presence of high concentrations of Na+, Li+, Mn2+, or OH- but are indistinguishable from wild-type cells under standard culture conditions. To characterize regulatory pathways that may overlap with calcineurin, we performed a synthetic lethal screen to identify mutants that require calcineurin on standard growth media. The characterization of one such mutant, cnd1-8, is presented. The CND1 gene was cloned, and sequence analysis predicts that it encodes a novel protein 1,876 amino acids in length with multiple membrane-spanning domains. CND1 is identical to the gene identified previously as FKS1, ETG1, and CWH53, cnd1 mutants are sensitive to FK506 and cyclosporin A and exhibit slow growth that is improved by the addition of osmotic stabilizing agents. This osmotic agent-remedial growth defect and microscopic evidence of spontaneous cell lysis in cnd1 cultures suggest that cell integrity is compromised in these mutants. Mutations in the genes for yeast protein kinase C (pkc1) and a MAP kinase (mpk1/slt2) disrupt a Ca(2+)-dependent signaling pathway required to maintain a normal cell wall and cell integrity. We show that pkc1 and mpk1/slt2 growth defects are more severe in the absence of calcineurin function and less severe in the presence of a constitutively active form of calcineurin. These observations suggest that calcineurin and protein kinase C perform independent but physiologically related functions in yeast cells. We show that several mutants that lack a functional vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (vma) require calcineurin for vegetative growth. We discuss possible roles for calcineurin in regulating intracellular ion homeostasis and in maintaining cell integrity.",Sequence,calcineurin cacalmodulindependent protein phosphatase essential yeast mutant cell integrity defect mutant lack functional vacuolar hatpase calcineurin conserved cacalmodulindependent protein phosphatase play critical role camediated signaling many cell yeast cell lacking functional calcineurin cna cna cnb mutant display growth defect specific environmental condition example presence high concentration na li mn oh indistinguishable wildtype cell standard culture condition characterize regulatory pathway may overlap calcineurin performed synthetic lethal screen identify mutant require calcineurin standard growth medium characterization one mutant cnd presented cnd gene cloned sequence analysis predicts encodes novel protein amino acid length multiple membranespanning domain cnd identical gene identified previously fks etg cwh cnd mutant sensitive fk cyclosporin exhibit slow growth improved addition osmotic stabilizing agent osmotic agentremedial growth defect microscopic evidence spontaneous cell lysis cnd culture suggest cell integrity compromised mutant mutation gene yeast protein kinase pkc map kinase mpkslt disrupt cadependent signaling pathway required maintain normal cell wall cell integrity show pkc mpkslt growth defect severe absence calcineurin function le severe presence constitutively active form calcineurin observation suggest calcineurin protein kinase perform independent physiologically related function yeast cell show several mutant lack functional vacuolar hatpase vma require calcineurin vegetative growth discus possible role calcineurin regulating intracellular ion homeostasis maintaining cell integrity

7542717,"Metoprine, an inhibitor of histamine N-methyltransferase but not catechol-O-methyltransferase, suppresses feeding in sated and in food deprived rats. Metoprine is a histamine N-methyltransferase (HMT) inhibitor often used to elevate endogenous histamine (HA) levels when studying the role of brain HA. Since central histaminergic systems may be involved in the regulation of feeding, the effect of metoprine on food intake was studied in sated and in food deprived rats. The treatment caused a dose-dependent decrease in food intake in sated rats. It also suppressed deprivation-induced feeding. To clarify the specificity of the treatment, the effect of metoprine on another methylating enzyme, catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), was examined indirectly by examining the ratio of the non-methylated dopamine metabolite, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) to that of its methylated product homovanillic acid (HVA). The dopamine metabolites did not change in a manner consistent with COMT inhibition, but instead a transient decrease in DOPAC levels was observed. However, the suppression of feeding is considered to be related to the metoprine-induced inhibition of brain HA catabolism and not with the changes in dopaminergic systems. Metoprine had no effect on brain concentration of serotonin (5-HT) or its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA).

Fibers were categorized as either fast, slow, or fast and slow (Fast-Slow) based on monoclonal antibody labeling. Slow fibers had low Quant-mATPase activity and stained lightly with Alk-mATPase and darkly with Acid-mATPase. Fast fibers had high Quant-mATPase activity (approximately twice that of slow fibers) and stained darkly with Alk-mATPase and lightly with Acid-mATPase. Fast-Slow fibers had intermediate Quant-mATPase activity and stained intermediately for Acid-mATPase and darkly for Alk-mATPase.

7542608,"Transition and determinants of orthodontic root resorption-repair sequence. When severe root resorption is observed during orthodontic treatment the clinician needs to know how the active process can be stopped. It is generally assumed that if active force is discontinued, the root resorption will end. The determinants of the resorption/repair sequence are, however, not well understood. The aim of the present study was to register and analyse determinants that may influence the extent of resorbed root surface, as well as the transition of a process of active root resorption into a process of tissue deposition/repair in the resorption lacunae. Using an experimental model that would simulate the first force-activation cycle, the upper first molars of rats were moved mesially by a fixed orthodontic appliance for periods between 2 and 21 days. The results revealed that (1) the extent of root resorption after 21 days corresponded with the maximal extent of the hyalinized zone; (2) a process of repair started from the periphery in the resorbed lacunae where the periodontal ligament (PDL) had been re-established, while ongoing active resorption was observed beneath the existing hyalinized tissue; and (3) root resorption continued in the area where hyalinized tissue persisted even after active force had terminated. It is hypothesized that determinants of continued resorption/repair generally seem to be associated with the persistence and removal of the necrotic tissue.",Sequence,transition determinant orthodontic root resorptionrepair sequence severe root resorption observed orthodontic treatment clinician need know active process stopped generally assumed active force discontinued root resorption end determinant resorptionrepair sequence however well understood aim present study register analyse determinant may influence extent resorbed root surface well transition process active root resorption process tissue depositionrepair resorption lacuna using experimental model simulate first forceactivation cycle upper first molar rat moved mesially fixed orthodontic appliance period day result revealed extent root resorption day corresponded maximal extent hyalinized zone process repair started periphery resorbed lacuna periodontal ligament pdl reestablished ongoing active resorption observed beneath existing hyalinized tissue root resorption continued area hyalinized tissue persisted even active force terminated hypothesized determinant continued resorptionrepair generally seem associated persistence removal necrotic tissue
7542578,"Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and MxA-protein expression in blood leucocytes. The underlying immunopathogenic mechanism of CVID has been suspected to involve a chronic viral infection or an autoimmune condition. However, formal proof of viral infection is lacking. Measurement of MxA-protein in leucocyte lysates is a sensitive test for evaluating the activation of the host's interferon system. Both viral infections and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) strongly induce MxA-protein in peripheral leucocytes. We therefore examined 15 patients with longlasting hypogammaglobulinaemia for MxA-protein induction in vivo: 13 patients suffered from CVID, one from hyper-IgM syndrome, and one patient had chronic B lymphocytic leukaemia associated with immunoglobulin deficiency and chronic papilloma virus infection (condylomata accuminata). Only the latter patient exhibited a strong MxA-protein expression; two CVID patients were borderline positive, and the remaining 12 patients including the hyper-IgM syndrome were MxA-protein-negative. There was no relationship between MxA expression and low CD4/CD8 ratios or increased CD8/CD57+ T cell counts, although both conditions are often observed in CVID as well as in chronic viral infections. When exposed in vitro to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), peripheral blood leucocytes of four MxA-negative patients were capable of producing normal amounts of MxA-protein.

To evaluate the effect of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), dextran 70 and their combination on platelet adhesion and fibrinogen uptake in ePTFE grafts in an experimental sheep model. Prospective open study. Animal Laboratory of a University Hospital. Early thrombogenicity of ePTFE grafts was studied after interposition in the two common carotid arteries of 40 adult sheep. The animals received one of four different treatment regimens in a double blind randomised way: enoxaparin and polygeline, saline and dextran 70, enoxaparin and dextran 70 or saline and polygeline (control). The substances were administered i.v. with a total dose of 73 antifactor-Xa U/kg for enoxaparin and 1.0 g/kg for dextran 70. Polygeline and saline were used as placebo substances in equivalent volumes. On one side (random allocation) the carotid blood flow was restricted to 25 ml/min, on the other side it was left unrestricted. The following variables were studied: 1) fibrinogen uptake; 2) platelet uptake; 3) early graft patency; 4) blood flow in patient grafts; 5) visible presence of graft thrombus; 6) thrombus weight. The results verified the importance of adequate blood flow as only 30% of grafts with restricted blood flow in the control group were patent compared with 80% of those with unrestricted blood flow (p = 0.038).

7542540,"Reduction of AMPA-selective glutamate receptor subunits in the entorhinal cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease pathology: a biochemical study. Using biochemical techniques we determined concentrations of the AMPA-selective glutamate receptor subunits GluR1 and GluR2/3 in the entorhinal cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease pathology and age-matched controls. Tangle density was also determined in anatomically matched samples and correlated with GluR1 and GluR2/3 receptor concentration. In Alzheimer's disease brain, Western blot analysis revealed average reductions of 43% and 38% for GluR1 and GluR2/3, respectively. Based on previous immunohistochemical studies, we infer that the majority of protein reduction was due to decreases in GluR1 and GluR2/3 immunolabeled elements in the more superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex (layers II and III). These layers of the entorhinal cortex contained numerous neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease, but neither GluR1 nor GluR2/3 protein concentration correlated significantly with tangle density.

We have previously reported the presence of posthypoxic, audiogenic myoclonus in rats after cardiac arrest and the ability of the 5-HT precursor, 5-HTP, to attenuate these muscle jerks. In addition, we have recently shown that 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 agonists can reduce the severity of myoclonus in these animals, suggesting a deficiency in serotonergic neurotransmission. In the present study, the levels of 5-HTP, 5-HT, and 5-HIAA were measured in seven regions of the brain in myoclonic and normal rats to identify the areas of the brain in which a serotonergic dysfunction resides. Similar to previous studies, we observed pronounced posthypoxic, audiogenic myoclonus 3 and 14 days after resuscitation from cardiac arrest, with a resolution of the abnormal movements by 45 days postarrest. HPLC measurements revealed significant changes in indole levels in the following areas of the brain: cortical 5-HIAA, striatal 5-HT, striatal 5-HIAA, hippocampal 5-HT, mesencephalic 5-HIAA, myelencephalic 5-HT, myelencephalic 5-HIAA, cerebellar 5-HTP, and cerebellar 5-HT. The changes in striatal 5-HT, cortical 5-HIAA, and mesencephalic 5-HIAA appear most relevant to the pathophysiology of posthypoxic myoclonus because regression analyses showed significant correlations between the myoclonus scores of the animals and the levels of these indoles.

7542333,"Mechanisms of acylcarnitine-mediated enhancement of calcium transport in the Caco-2 cell monolayer model. The overall objective of this study was to determine the mechanisms of acylcarnitine-mediated enhancement of calcium transport across Caco-2 cells. The different mechanisms of enhancement postulated are (a) loosening of tight junctions, thereby promoting paracellular transport; (b) opening of calcium channels, thus increasing calcium entry; and (c) stimulation of the basolateral Ca-ATPase pump, thereby aiding calcium extrusion. Although the existence of calcium channels and the reversal of verapamil-mediated inhibition of calcium uptake by acylcarnitines were demonstrated for the first time in Caco-2 cells, the channels do not appear to be a major contributing factor to the enhancement of calcium transport by acylcarnitines. Calmidazolium, a potent Ca-ATPase pump inhibitor in tissues such as rat intestinal segments, failed to inhibit this pump in Caco-2 cells. Thus, the predominant mechanism of enhancement of calcium transport by acylcarnitines in the Caco-2 model appears to be via promotion of paracellular transport.",Sequence,mechanism acylcarnitinemediated enhancement calcium transport caco cell monolayer model overall objective study determine mechanism acylcarnitinemediated enhancement calcium transport across caco cell different mechanism enhancement postulated loosening tight junction thereby promoting paracellular transport opening calcium channel thus increasing calcium entry stimulation basolateral caatpase pump thereby aiding calcium extrusion although existence calcium channel reversal verapamilmediated inhibition calcium uptake acylcarnitines demonstrated first time caco cell channel appear major contributing factor enhancement calcium transport acylcarnitines calmidazolium potent caatpase pump inhibitor tissue rat intestinal segment failed inhibit pump caco cell thus predominant mechanism enhancement calcium transport acylcarnitines caco model appears via promotion paracellular transport

7542145,"Effects of morphine and morphine withdrawal on adrenergic neurons of the rat rostral ventrolateral medulla. In urethane anesthetized rats, iontophoretic application of morphine or alpha-methylnoradrenaline (alpha-MNE) inhibited (80-100%) the discharges of all putative adrenergic (C1) cells of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). The effect of morphine was blocked selectively by naloxone while that of alpha-MNE was blocked selectively by the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist idazoxan. Putative C1 cells were inhibited (75-100%) by low i.v. doses of clonidine (10-15 micrograms/kg). Most cells (7/10) were also inhibited by morphine i.v. (81% at 7 mg/kg). Two cells were slightly excited at doses below 2 mg/kg and inhibited at higher doses. Three cells were excited only. All effects of morphine i.v. were reversed by naloxone (1 mg/kg, i.v.). Intravenous administration of naloxone to morphine-dependent rats increased significantly the firing rate of all putative C1 adrenergic cells (from 5.8 +/- 0.9 spikes/s to 12.3 +/- 1.5 spikes/s; n = 8). During withdrawal these cells could still be inhibited (80-100%) by i.v. injection of clonidine (15 micrograms/kg). C-Fos expression induced by naltrexone-precipitated withdrawal was examined in the brainstem of freely moving morphine-dependent rats pretreated with clonidine or saline before injection of the opioid antagonist. The locus coeruleus (LC) of the same rats was examined for comparison. Morphine withdrawal without clonidine treatment significantly increased the number of Fos-like-immunoreactive (Fos-LIR) cells in the RVLM and LC. Clonidine pretreatment (1 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced the number of withdrawal-activated Fos-LIR cells in LC by 81%. In the RVLM this reduction averaged 37% for all cell types and 48% for C1 adrenergic cells. Further, a very large proportion of RVLM neurons that expressed c-Fos during morphine withdrawal (83%) were immunoreactive for alpha 2A-adrenergic receptors. This study suggests that, like noradrenergic cells of the LC, C1 adrenergic neurons of the RVLM are: (i) inhibited by both opiate and alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonists; and (ii) activated during naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal. Since C1 cells are considered essential to sympathetic tone generation, their inhibition by morphine may contribute to the hypotensive effects of this opioid agonist in non-dependent individuals. Their excitation during opiate withdrawal may also contribute to the autonomic activation that characterizes this syndrome. Finally, inhibition of C1 cells by clonidine may contribute to the clinically recognized efficacy of this drug to attenuate autonomic signs of opiate withdrawal.",Sequence,effect morphine morphine withdrawal adrenergic neuron rat rostral ventrolateral medulla urethane anesthetized rat iontophoretic application morphine alphamethylnoradrenaline alphamne inhibited discharge putative adrenergic cell rostral ventrolateral medulla rvlm effect morphine blocked selectively naloxone alphamne blocked selectively alpha adrenergic antagonist idazoxan putative cell inhibited low iv dos clonidine microgramskg cell also inhibited morphine iv mgkg two cell slightly excited dos mgkg inhibited higher dos three cell excited effect morphine iv reversed naloxone mgkg iv intravenous administration naloxone morphinedependent rat increased significantly firing rate putative adrenergic cell spike spike withdrawal cell still inhibited iv injection clonidine microgramskg cfo expression induced naltrexoneprecipitated withdrawal examined brainstem freely moving morphinedependent rat pretreated clonidine saline injection opioid antagonist locus coeruleus lc rat examined comparison morphine withdrawal without clonidine treatment significantly increased number foslikeimmunoreactive foslir cell rvlm lc clonidine pretreatment mgkg ip reduced number withdrawalactivated foslir cell lc rvlm reduction averaged cell type adrenergic cell large proportion rvlm neuron expressed cfo morphine withdrawal immunoreactive alpha aadrenergic receptor study suggests like noradrenergic cell lc adrenergic neuron rvlm inhibited opiate alpha adrenergic receptor agonist ii activated naloxoneprecipitated morphine withdrawal since cell considered essential sympathetic tone generation inhibition morphine may contribute hypotensive effect opioid agonist nondependent individual excitation opiate withdrawal may also contribute autonomic activation characterizes syndrome finally inhibition cell clonidine may contribute clinically recognized efficacy drug attenuate autonomic sign opiate withdrawal
7542126,"The extracellular matrix molecule tenascin: expression in the developing chick retinotectal system and substrate properties for retinal ganglion cell neurites in vitro. To investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the outgrowth of retinal ganglion cell axons in the tectum, the expression of the extracellular matrix molecule tenascin was analysed in the tectum and retina of chickens by immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization. Tissue was analysed between embryonic days 4 and 12, just before and during the period when retinal ganglion cell axons innervate their target region, the optic tectum. In the tectum, tenascin immunoreactivity becomes detectable at the anterior pole at embryonic day 4, 2 days before retinal ganglion cell axons arrive, and spreads caudally with increasing age. At early stages, tenascin is predominantly accumulated in the stratum opticum, the zone of ingrowing retinal ganglion cell axons, and along their prospective pathway. In the stratum opticum, the molecule is associated with radial glial fibres, glial endfeet and retinal ganglion cell axons located in the immediate neighbourhood of radial glial fibres. At all ages investigated, tenascin mRNA is mainly restricted to cells located in the periventricular region, suggesting that the molecule is synthesized by radial glial cells. In the retina, tenascin is expressed by amacrine, displaced amacrine and horizontal cells but not by retinal ganglion cells. To investigate whether the accumulation of tenascin in the developing and prospective pathway of retinal ganglion cell axons may affect their rate of growth we assayed the substrate properties of tenascin for retinal ganglion cell neurites in vitro. When retinal ganglion cell suspensions from 6-day-old chick embryos were maintained on homogeneous mouse or chick tenascin/polyornithine substrates, neurite length was significantly increased when compared to polyornithine substrates at coating concentrations of 10 or 20 micrograms/ml. Higher coating concentrations (35 or 70 micrograms/ml) resulted in neurite lengths comparable to control values. Together, these observations suggest that tenascin in the developing and prospective stratum opticum might serve as a performed pathway to support growth of retinal ganglion cell axons in the tectum.",Sequence,extracellular matrix molecule tenascin expression developing chick retinotectal system substrate property retinal ganglion cell neurites vitro investigate molecular mechanism involved outgrowth retinal ganglion cell axon tectum expression extracellular matrix molecule tenascin analysed tectum retina chicken immunocytochemistry situ hybridization tissue analysed embryonic day period retinal ganglion cell axon innervate target region optic tectum tectum tenascin immunoreactivity becomes detectable anterior pole embryonic day day retinal ganglion cell axon arrive spread caudally increasing age early stage tenascin predominantly accumulated stratum opticum zone ingrowing retinal ganglion cell axon along prospective pathway stratum opticum molecule associated radial glial fibre glial endfeet retinal ganglion cell axon located immediate neighbourhood radial glial fibre age investigated tenascin mrna mainly restricted cell located periventricular region suggesting molecule synthesized radial glial cell retina tenascin expressed amacrine displaced amacrine horizontal cell retinal ganglion cell investigate whether accumulation tenascin developing prospective pathway retinal ganglion cell axon may affect rate growth assayed substrate property tenascin retinal ganglion cell neurites vitro retinal ganglion cell suspension dayold chick embryo maintained homogeneous mouse chick tenascinpolyornithine substrate neurite length significantly increased compared polyornithine substrate coating concentration microgramsml higher coating concentration microgramsml resulted neurite length comparable control value together observation suggest tenascin developing prospective stratum opticum might serve performed pathway support growth retinal ganglion cell axon tectum

The clinical effects of finasteride, a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Forty-six patients with symptomatic BPH were randomly assigned to 2 groups, the finasteride group and the placebo group. The finasteride group received 5 mg of finasteride daily for 6 months. Prostate volume, urinary flow, urinary symptoms, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and adverse events were determined before and after treatment. After 6 months of treatment the patients treated with 5 mg of finasteride per day had a 30% decrease in their total urinary symptom score, a 14% decrease in prostate volume and a 0.9 ng/dL decrease of PSA. Their maximal urinary flow rate increased by 1.42 mL per second and the mean urinary flow rate increased by 0.64 mL per second. The patients given placebo showed no significant changes in their prostate volume, serum PSA and maximal and mean urinary flow rate. However, the symptom scores in the placebo group also decreased significantly. When compared with the placebo group, those in the finasteride group had significantly lower prostate volume, serum PSA, maximal urinary flow rate and urinary symptoms, but not mean urinary flow rate.

All sections of human heart tissue demonstrate tryptase- and chymase-containing mast cells (HHMCs) which have for the first time been isolated, partially purified and studied in vitro. HHMCs contain similar histamine levels as lung and skin mast cells, but tryptase levels are lower than in skin and higher than in lung mast cells. Complement C5a causes rapid dose-dependent release of histamine from HHMCs, but they are refractory to substance P and fMLP. Cross-linking IgE receptors on HHMCs leads to arachidonic acid metabolism through both the cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase pathways.

7541534,"Interaction with the recombination hot spot chi in vivo converts the RecBCD enzyme of Escherichia coli into a chi-independent recombinase by inactivation of the RecD subunit. The RecBCD enzyme of Escherichia coli promotes recombination preferentially at chi nucleotide sequences and has in vivo helicase and strong duplex DNA exonuclease (exoV) activities. The enzyme without the RecD subunit, as in a recD null mutant, promotes recombination efficiently but independently of chi and has no nucleolytic activity. Employing phage lambda red gam crosses, phage T4 2- survival measurements, and exoV assays, it is shown that E. coli cells in which RecBCD has extensive opportunity to interact with linear chi-containing DNA (produced by rolling circle replication of a plasmid with chi or by bleomycin-induced fragmentation of the cellular chromosome) acquire the phenotype of a recD mutant and maintain this for approximately 2 h. It is concluded that RecBCD is converted into RecBC during interaction with chi by irreversible inactivation of RecD. After conversion, the enzyme is released and initiates recombination on other DNA molecules in a chi-independent fashion. Overexpression of recD+ (from a plasmid) prevented the phenotypic change and providing RecD after the change restored chi-stimulated recombination. The observed recA+ dependence of the downregulation of exoV could explain the previously noted ""reckless"" DNA degradation of recA mutants. It is proposed that chi sites are regulatory elements for the RecBCD to RecBC switch and thereby function as cis- and trans-acting stimulators of RecBC-dependent recombination.",Sequence,interaction recombination hot spot chi vivo convert recbcd enzyme escherichia coli chiindependent recombinase inactivation recd subunit recbcd enzyme escherichia coli promotes recombination preferentially chi nucleotide sequence vivo helicase strong duplex dna exonuclease exov activity enzyme without recd subunit recd null mutant promotes recombination efficiently independently chi nucleolytic activity employing phage lambda red gam cross phage survival measurement exov assay shown coli cell recbcd extensive opportunity interact linear chicontaining dna produced rolling circle replication plasmid chi bleomycininduced fragmentation cellular chromosome acquire phenotype recd mutant maintain approximately concluded recbcd converted recbc interaction chi irreversible inactivation recd conversion enzyme released initiate recombination dna molecule chiindependent fashion overexpression recd plasmid prevented phenotypic change providing recd change restored chistimulated recombination observed reca dependence downregulation exov explain previously noted reckless dna degradation reca mutant proposed chi site regulatory element recbcd recbc switch thereby function ci transacting stimulators recbcdependent recombination

Luteinizing hormone (LH), total testosterone (T), and free T were measured on stored AM sera by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Free T was also calculated from the measured concentrations of total T and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). The median number of repeated sex steroid measurements ranged from 6-9 over a period from 7-25 years prior to the diagnosis of prostate disease. There were no significant differences in age-adjusted LH, total T, SHBG, or calculated free T levels among the groups at 0-5, 5-10, and 10-15 years before diagnosis.

The study was designed to assess the toxicity and activity of high-dose ifosfamide (HDI) administered by continuous infusion at a dose of 4 g/m2/d over 3 days every 4 weeks in adult patients with advanced soft tissue sarcomas (ASTS) pretreated with doxorubicin and/or a standard-dose ifosfamide (SDI)-containing regimen. Between January 1991 and November 1993, 40 patients with progressive ASTS were entered onto the study. Twenty-eight patients had been pretreated with a multidrug regimen that contained SDI and were classified as follows: SDI-refractory (n = 21), SDI-resistant (n = 2), and indeterminate SDI-sensitive (n = 5). Patients were treated until progression or major toxicity. One hundred forty-seven cycles of HDI were administered. Neutropenia was dose-limiting, with 100% of patients experiencing grade 3 to 4 toxicity and 12 admissions for febrile neutropenia (30% of patients). Neurotoxicity (17% of patients) was significantly associated with acute renal failure (n = 4) (P < .001), grade 4 thrombocytopenia (P < .01) and febrile neutropenia (P = .048). Chronic renal toxicity (n = 4) was significantly associated with retroperitoneal masses and/or prior nephrectomy (P = .008).

It is demonstrated that recurrent pulmonary embolism may cause pulmonary hypertention. In recent years, P-selectin (granule membrane protein, GMP140) was found to be a surface marker for platelet activation. In order to investigate the role of platelet in chronic cor pulmonale, the changes of P-selectin on platelet membrane and its effect on platelet adhesiveness (PAdT) and platelet aggregation (PAgT) were studied. The results showed that the changes of P-selectin PAdT and PAgT in chronic cor pulmonale were significant than those in chronic pulmonary diseases and controls (P < 0.01).

7541320,"Characterization of c-kit-positive neurons in the dorsal root ganglion of mouse. Previously, we showed that c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase is expressed by a subpopulation of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and that the ligand for the c-kit receptor, stem cell factor (SCF), induces the neurite outgrowth and supports the survival of these neurons in culture [16]. However, it is unknown which class of DRG neurons express c-kit receptor and which factor regulates differentiation and survival of c-kit-positive neurons. In the present study, we attempted to characterize c-kit positive neurons in the mouse DRG. The c-kit-positive neurons were small or medium in size, and 44% of these neurons contained substance P. Central fibers of the c-kit-positive neurons terminated in laminae I and II of the gray matter of the spinal cord. These results suggest that c-kit-positive neurons in the DRG belong to a functional subpopulation. The c-kit receptor protein was presented on the membrane of processes and growth cones in neurons. When DRG cells of embryonic day 15.5 or 17.5 were cultured, the survival of c-kit-positive neurons was supported by SCF, nerve growth factor (NGF) or leukemia inhibitory factor. SCF and NGF synergistically supported the survival of c-kit-positive neurons at submaximal concentrations. c-kit-positive DRG neurons from neonatal mice survived without addition of any factor in culture, suggesting that the requirement for trophic support in c-kit-positive neurons changes during development.",Sequence,characterization ckitpositive neuron dorsal root ganglion mouse previously showed ckit receptor tyrosine kinase expressed subpopulation dorsal root ganglion drg neuron ligand ckit receptor stem cell factor scf induces neurite outgrowth support survival neuron culture however unknown class drg neuron express ckit receptor factor regulates differentiation survival ckitpositive neuron present study attempted characterize ckit positive neuron mouse drg ckitpositive neuron small medium size neuron contained substance central fiber ckitpositive neuron terminated lamina ii gray matter spinal cord result suggest ckitpositive neuron drg belong functional subpopulation ckit receptor protein presented membrane process growth cone neuron drg cell embryonic day cultured survival ckitpositive neuron supported scf nerve growth factor ngf leukemia inhibitory factor scf ngf synergistically supported survival ckitpositive neuron submaximal concentration ckitpositive drg neuron neonatal mouse survived without addition factor culture suggesting requirement trophic support ckitpositive neuron change development

We have analysed changes in tau protein immunoreactivity in rat embryonic neurons degenerating in response to treatment with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), non-NMDA and metabotropic agonists. Glutamate agonists were applied in Mg(++)-free and glycine-supplemented medium 8 days after initial plating. Cell viability was assessed by fluorescein diacetate staining and neuronal survival was evaluated by cell counting. Immunocytochemical and confocal laser microscopic studies used a tau2 monoclonal antibody. Acute and chronic NMDA treatment induced a concentration-dependent increase in intraneuronal tau immunoreactivity. Increased tau immunolabelling during chronic NMDA toxicity was dramatically attenuated by tetrodotoxin and also by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione. Non-NMDA and metabotropic receptor agonist treatment produced a weaker augmentation in tau2 immunoreactivity.

7541286,"Expression of a serotonin-gated ion channel in embryonic neural and nonneural tissues. The neurotransmitter serotonin (5HT) has been implicated in morphogenesis of central nervous system and craniofacial structures. The actions of serotonin are mediated by multiple receptor subtypes, one of which, the 5HT3 receptor, is a ligand-gated ion channel. To determine whether this channel may contribute to the proposed morphogenic actions of serotonin, the expression of 5HT3 receptor transcripts was examined during mouse embryogenesis and correlated with the distribution of serotonin transporter mRNA and serotonin immunoreactivity. The pattern of 5HT3 receptor mRNA expression within the brain suggests possible roles for this receptor in the proliferation, differentiation, or migration of CNS neurons. In the peripheral nervous system, 5HT3 receptor transcripts were observed within cranial nerve sensory ganglia, olfactory neuroepithelia, and sympathoadrenal and enteric nervous systems during the initial stages of their formation. Striking expression of 5HT3 receptor transcripts occurred outside the nervous system, in association with regions of active chondrogenesis in the vertebral column, limbs, and craniofacial region, suggesting a possible involvement of this receptor subtype in the morphogenesis of olfactory receptor neurons, teeth, and genitalia.",Sequence,expression serotoningated ion channel embryonic neural nonneural tissue neurotransmitter serotonin ht implicated morphogenesis central nervous system craniofacial structure action serotonin mediated multiple receptor subtypes one ht receptor ligandgated ion channel determine whether channel may contribute proposed morphogenic action serotonin expression ht receptor transcript examined mouse embryogenesis correlated distribution serotonin transporter mrna serotonin immunoreactivity pattern ht receptor mrna expression within brain suggests possible role receptor proliferation differentiation migration cns neuron peripheral nervous system ht receptor transcript observed within cranial nerve sensory ganglion olfactory neuroepithelia sympathoadrenal enteric nervous system initial stage formation striking expression ht receptor transcript occurred outside nervous system association region active chondrogenesis vertebral column limb craniofacial region suggesting possible involvement receptor subtype morphogenesis olfactory receptor neuron teeth genitalia

Thirty-six male Wistar rats (225g average b.w.) were studied after direct He-Ne laser irradiation (632.8 nm, 5 mW) of the surgically-exposed pineal gland. Total irradiation time was 5 minutes, with rest intervals of 1 minute for every minute of irradiation. The animals were sacrificed in groups of 4 (controls, irradiated animals and sham-operated rats--i.e., craniotomy without irradiation) on days 3, 7 and 10 postirradiation. A significant increase was seen (p < 0.0001) in the medullary and cortical karyometric indices of the pineal body in all experimental, control and sham-operated animals. The increase was greatest (over 50%) on day 3 postirradiation among the experimental animals, with respect to the control and sham-operated groups. A progressive and significant decrease in karyometric index (p < 0.05) was in turn observed on days 7 and 10 postirradiation, although the values remained higher than among the controls. Ultrastructurally, there were cytoplasmic signs of an increase in metabolic activity in the experimental animals on days 3 and 7, followed by a decrease in activity by day 10 with the appearance of numerous lipid droplets, pericanallicular dark cells and mesoglial cells.

7540930,"Effects of combined or separate 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine lesions of the dorsal and median raphe nuclei on responding maintained by a DRL 20s schedule of food reinforcement. Previous studies have shown that long-term 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) depletion induced by combined dorsal and median raphe injections of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) leads to impairments in the acquisition and performance of behaviour maintained under a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate (DRL) schedule of reinforcement. The present studies examined the relative importance of dorsal versus median raphe 5-HT projections in mediating these effects by investigating the impact of separate versus combined infusions of 5,7-DHT into these sites on DRL responding. Adult male rats received injections of 3 micrograms 5,7-DHT into both dorsal raphe and median raphe, dorsal raphe only, or median raphe only. Sham-operated controls received vehicle injections. Animals were then trained to respond on a DRL 20s schedule for 36 days. Combined dorsal raphe and median raphe 5,7-DHT infusions depleted striatal and hippocampal 5-HT by > 90%, increased responding, decreased the number of reinforcers earned, lowered the mean inter-response time (IRT), and shifted the frequency distribution of IRTs to the left. Median raphe 5,7-DHT infusions induced similar behavioural effects and reduced hippocampal 5-HT by 64%. Dorsal raphe 5,7-DHT lesions, that depleted striatal 5-HT by 56%, and hippocampal 5-HT by 30%, had no effect on behaviour. In a final experiment it was shown that providing an external cue light to signal food availability, and that removed the need to rely on internal timing processes, resulted in rapid acquisition of responding, and prevented the behavioural deficits in 5,7-DHT-lesioned rats. Following removal of this cue, responding deteriorated, and the 5,7-DHT treated animals performed worse than controls. These results suggest that destruction of 5-HT neurons arising from the median raphe is sufficient to disrupt behaviour maintained by a DRL 20s schedule, and that the behavioural changes observed may involve a deficit in timing.",Sequence,effect combined separate dihydroxytryptamine lesion dorsal median raphe nucleus responding maintained drl schedule food reinforcement previous study shown longterm hydroxytryptamine ht depletion induced combined dorsal median raphe injection dihydroxytryptamine dht lead impairment acquisition performance behaviour maintained differentialreinforcementoflowrate drl schedule reinforcement present study examined relative importance dorsal versus median raphe ht projection mediating effect investigating impact separate versus combined infusion dht site drl responding adult male rat received injection microgram dht dorsal raphe median raphe dorsal raphe median raphe shamoperated control received vehicle injection animal trained respond drl schedule day combined dorsal raphe median raphe dht infusion depleted striatal hippocampal ht increased responding decreased number reinforcer earned lowered mean interresponse time irt shifted frequency distribution irts left median raphe dht infusion induced similar behavioural effect reduced hippocampal ht dorsal raphe dht lesion depleted striatal ht hippocampal ht effect behaviour final experiment shown providing external cue light signal food availability removed need rely internal timing process resulted rapid acquisition responding prevented behavioural deficit dhtlesioned rat following removal cue responding deteriorated dht treated animal performed worse control result suggest destruction ht neuron arising median raphe sufficient disrupt behaviour maintained drl schedule behavioural change observed may involve deficit timing

7540211,"Ranking potential binding peptides to MHC molecules by a computational threading approach. In this paper, an approach developed to address the inverse protein folding problem is applied to prediction of potential binding peptides to a specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. Overlapping peptides, spanning the entire protein sequence, are threaded through the backbone coordinates of a known peptide fold in the MHC groove, and their interaction energies are evaluated using statistical pairwise contact potentials. With currently available tables for pairwise potentials, promising results are obtained for MHC-peptide complexes where hydrophobic interactions predominate. By ranking the peptides in an ascending order according to their energy values, it is demonstrated that, in most cases, known antigenic peptides are highly ranked. Furthermore, predicted hierarchies are consistent with experimental binding results. Currently, predictions of potential binding peptides to a specific MHC molecule are based on the identification of allele-specific binding motifs. However, it has been demonstrated that these motifs are neither sufficient nor strictly required to ensure binding. The computational procedure presented here succeeds in determining the MHC binding potential of peptides along a protein amino acid sequence, without relying on binding motifs. The proposed scheme may significantly reduce the number of peptides to be tested, identify good binders that do not necessarily show the known allele-specific binding motifs, and identify the best candidates among those with the motifs. In general, when structural information about a protein-peptide complex is available, the current application of the threading approach can be used to screen a large library of peptides for selection of the best binders to the target protein.",Sequence,ranking potential binding peptide mhc molecule computational threading approach paper approach developed address inverse protein folding problem applied prediction potential binding peptide specific major histocompatibility complex mhc molecule overlapping peptide spanning entire protein sequence threaded backbone coordinate known peptide fold mhc groove interaction energy evaluated using statistical pairwise contact potential currently available table pairwise potential promising result obtained mhcpeptide complex hydrophobic interaction predominate ranking peptide ascending order according energy value demonstrated case known antigenic peptide highly ranked furthermore predicted hierarchy consistent experimental binding result currently prediction potential binding peptide specific mhc molecule based identification allelespecific binding motif however demonstrated motif neither sufficient strictly required ensure binding computational procedure presented succeeds determining mhc binding potential peptide along protein amino acid sequence without relying binding motif proposed scheme may significantly reduce number peptide tested identify good binder necessarily show known allelespecific binding motif identify best candidate among motif general structural information proteinpeptide complex available current application threading approach used screen large library peptide selection best binder target protein
7540195,"Intercellular adhesion molecule 3, a candidate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 co-receptor on lymphoid and monocytoid cells. The CD4 molecule serves as the principal cell surface receptor common to both the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV). Since binding to CD4 is not sufficient to permit virus entry, HIV 'co-receptors' have been implicated in mediating the fusion of viral and cellular membranes necessary for completing the entry process. In order to identify candidate co-receptor molecules, a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against adhesion molecules was tested for the ability of the MAbs to inhibit HIV-1-induced cell fusion (syncytium formation) and HIV-1 entry. Certain antibodies directed against CD18, CD11b and CD11c inhibited HIV-1-induced syncytium formation but not entry, in agreement with previous reports. Interestingly, certain antibodies to ICAM-3 (intercellular adhesion molecule 3) (CD50) significantly inhibited HIV-1-specific entry but not syncytium formation using human SupT1 cells.

In Ca2+ electrode experiments, DBHC (100 microM) markedly inhibited Ca2+ release from the heavy fraction of sarcoplasmic reticulum (HSR) induced by caffeine (1 mM) and BED (10 microM). 3. DBHC (0.1 to 100 microM) inhibited 45Ca2+ release induced by Ca2+ from HSR in a concentration-dependent manner. 4.

N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists have been proposed as potential therapeutic agents in different neurological diseases, including Parkinson's disease. The effects of gene expression of a chronic treatment with the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, dizocilpine maleate (0.8 mg/kg day, per os for 50 days) were analysed in rat striata. Using quantitative in situ hybridization, we measured the messenger RNA expression of the genes encoding D1, D2 dopamine receptors, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, preproenkephalin A and substance P. Chronic treatment with dizocilpine maleate induced a moderate but significant increase in messenger RNA of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 subunit in the striatum and the adjacent cortex, suggesting an action of dizocilpine maleate in these two regions. This treatment did not induce any change in D1 receptor, preproenkephalin A or substance P messenger RNA content in the striatum, whereas D2 receptor messenger RNA was increased in the striatum of treated rats. Microscopic analysis revealed that it was the number of medium-sized neurons expressing D2 receptor messenger RNA that was significantly enhanced, while the mean amount of message per cell remained unchanged.

7539492,"Regulation of angiogenesis by extracellular matrix: the growth and the glue. Angiogenesis is broadly defined as the growth of new capillaries from extant vessels and constitutes a major part of developmental morphogenesis, response to injury and pathogenesis. Two regulatory pathways are proposed by which angiogenesis is thought to proceed. The proliferative pathway depends on various cytokines and other factors that both stimulate and inhibit the proliferation of endothelial cells. One of these components, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), might function at several levels to control the progression of neovessels. Proteolysis of this component (e.g. by plasmin) results in the release of peptides containing the sequence Gly-His-Lys, which are angiogenic in vitro and in vivo. At later stages of angiogenesis when endothelial cell proliferation ceases, the intact protein is proposed to exert its known inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression. The morphogenetic pathway depends on the synthesis and assembly of fibrillar type I collagen, which can be used as a template for endothelial cell migration and lumen formation. Endothelial cells interact with substrates of type I collagen and form networks based on the establishment of traction centers. These planar cellular networks, in some respects, resemble developing vasculature in vivo. An understanding of how proliferation and morphogenesis are controlled during vascular growth is likely to reconcile several models with respect to the factors that regulate this dynamic process.",Sequence,regulation angiogenesis extracellular matrix growth glue angiogenesis broadly defined growth new capillary extant vessel constitutes major part developmental morphogenesis response injury pathogenesis two regulatory pathway proposed angiogenesis thought proceed proliferative pathway depends various cytokine factor stimulate inhibit proliferation endothelial cell one component secreted protein acidic rich cysteine sparc might function several level control progression neovessels proteolysis component eg plasmin result release peptide containing sequence glyhislys angiogenic vitro vivo later stage angiogenesis endothelial cell proliferation cease intact protein proposed exert known inhibitory effect cell cycle progression morphogenetic pathway depends synthesis assembly fibrillar type collagen used template endothelial cell migration lumen formation endothelial cell interact substrate type collagen form network based establishment traction center planar cellular network respect resemble developing vasculature vivo understanding proliferation morphogenesis controlled vascular growth likely reconcile several model respect factor regulate dynamic process

Electron-microscopic examination confirmed that these axons were unmyelinated. Nerve bundles in this region contained both myelinated and unmyelinated axons; however, immunoreactivity was detected exclusively in unmyelinated axons. Fine NOS-immunoreactive nerve fibers with terminal varicosities were often seen in the atrioventricular node. Close contact between NOS-immunoreactive axon varicosity and specialized cardiac muscle cell was observed. Intranodal ganglia were observed among the specialized cardiac muscles. They were surrounded by numerous axons, some of them were immunoreactive. Direct axo-somatic synapses from NOS-immunoreactive terminals to the intranodal ganglion cells were observed.

7539454,"Specific binding of endocrine transforming growth factor-beta 1 to vascular endothelium. The presentation of recombinant biologically active 125I-TGF-beta 1 via the bloodstream to potential target cells in mice and rats was evaluated by quantitative light and electron microscope radioautography. Specificity was evaluated by in vivo competition with excess unlabeled TGF-beta 1, and integrity of the ligand at the binding site was demonstrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation after extraction from tissues. The distribution of radiolabel at 2.5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after 125I-TGF-beta 1 injection revealed radiolabel principally over microvasculature endothelium but at times > 2.5 min over endothelial endocytic components indicative of internalization. Nonspecific binding of 125I-TGF-beta 1 to the apex of the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney indicated it as the likely site of rapid clearance of TGF-beta 1 from the circulation, while a comparison of the binding of 125I-TGF-beta 1 (endothelial) to that of 125I-TGF-beta 1 complexed with alpha 2-macroglobulin-methylamine (liver parenchyma) indicated that clearance of TGF-beta 1 complexed alpha 2-macroglobulin was likely via the hepatic alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor.

7539446,"Site and menstrual cycle-dependent expression of proteins of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, and BCL-2 oncoprotein and phase-specific production of TNF alpha in human endometrium. Apoptosis in human endometrial epithelium progressively increases from early to late secretory/menstrual phases and remains consistently more prominent in the basalis. It has been suggested that tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha secreted during the secretory/menstrual phases plays a role in induction of programmed cell death in these cells. In the present study, we characterized expression of receptors of TNF alpha, Fas antigen and BCL-2 in endometrial cells to gain insight as to whether this type of cell death in endometrium may be related to differential or preferential expression of these proteins at specific phases of the menstrual cycle. In addition, to relate production of TNF alpha to the development of apoptosis, the amount of TNF alpha released by human endometrium was measured. Immunostaining demonstrated that the TNF receptor (TNFr; p55/60)-I, TNFr-II (p75/80) as well as Fas protein were expressed in endometrial epithelium throughout the entire menstrual cycle. This expression was progressively diminished from the basalis towards the upper functionalis. In the proliferative phase, the expression of BCL-2 was prominent in the endometrial glands particularly in those residing in the basalis. This expression became weak as early as the third post-ovulatory day and remained low during the remaining phases of the menstrual cycle. The amount of TNF alpha released by endometrial fragments obtained from various phases of the menstrual cycle was determined. The amount of TNF alpha released into the culture medium by the endometrium was low in the proliferative phase. However, the amount of released TNF alpha progressively increased in the secretory phase and peaked in the menstrual phase. TNFr-I, TNFr-II, Fas, BCL-2 and TNF alpha could be identified by Western blot analysis of proteins extracted from endometrium. Therefore, endometrial epithelium by virtue of expression of receptors of TNF alpha as well as Fas protein is properly poised to respond to ligand signals that regulate apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis in endometrial epithelium and menstrual shedding may be related to loss of the protective effect of BCL-2 as well as to the amount of TNF alpha.",Sequence,site menstrual cycledependent expression protein tumour necrosis factor tnf receptor family bcl oncoprotein phasespecific production tnf alpha human endometrium apoptosis human endometrial epithelium progressively increase early late secretorymenstrual phase remains consistently prominent basalis suggested tumour necrosis factor tnf alpha secreted secretorymenstrual phase play role induction programmed cell death cell present study characterized expression receptor tnf alpha fa antigen bcl endometrial cell gain insight whether type cell death endometrium may related differential preferential expression protein specific phase menstrual cycle addition relate production tnf alpha development apoptosis amount tnf alpha released human endometrium measured immunostaining demonstrated tnf receptor tnfr pi tnfrii well fa protein expressed endometrial epithelium throughout entire menstrual cycle expression progressively diminished basalis towards upper functionalis proliferative phase expression bcl prominent endometrial gland particularly residing basalis expression became weak early third postovulatory day remained low remaining phase menstrual cycle amount tnf alpha released endometrial fragment obtained various phase menstrual cycle determined amount tnf alpha released culture medium endometrium low proliferative phase however amount released tnf alpha progressively increased secretory phase peaked menstrual phase tnfri tnfrii fa bcl tnf alpha identified western blot analysis protein extracted endometrium therefore endometrial epithelium virtue expression receptor tnf alpha well fa protein properly poised respond ligand signal regulate apoptosis induction apoptosis endometrial epithelium menstrual shedding may related loss protective effect bcl well amount tnf alpha
7539434,"Evidence of redox-linked signaling for producing a giant signal complex. Previously we showed that a thiol-reactive heavy metal, HgCl2, crosslinked multiple cell surface receptors through a ligand-independent pathway, which produced massive aggregates of phosphotyrosine (PTYR)-containing proteins beneath plasma membrane [Nakashima et al. (1994): J Immunol 152: 1064-1071]. In this study we characterized these unique aggregates at the molecular level. The lysates in Brij 96 of thymocytes treated with HgCl2 were separated into the supernatant and pellet fractions by simple centrifugation. Selected PTYR-containing proteins and p56lck appeared in the pellet fraction as quickly as 5 s after exposure to HgCl2, and were further increased in amount by 5 min. Although the mechanism of triggering these events was redox-linked, the majority of proteins in the Brij 96-insoluble aggregates were dissociated in SDS-PAGE under nonreducing condition. This suggested that PTYR-containing proteins and p56lck themselves do not form dimer or polymer directly by thiol-mediated bond. The pellet fraction was further found to include some other signal delivery elements, such as GTPase activating protein, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, all of these signal elements and selected PTYR-containing proteins were collected in the same fraction by the sucrose density gradient centrifugation.

7539406,"Cloning, characterization, and antigen specificity of T-lymphocyte subsets extracted from gingival tissue of chronic adult periodontitis patients. Chronic periodontitis is characterized by dense infiltrations of B and T lymphocytes within the gingival connective tissue. Distinct anaerobic gram-negative bacteria as well as autoimmunity to collagen have been reported to play a role in the etiology and the pathogenesis of this disease. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes isolated from inflamed gingival tissue obtained from four patients with chronic periodontitis. Clones were raised with phytohemagglutinin and interleukin-2 and tested for proliferation in response to whole-cell antigens of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, human collagen type I, and two bacterial heat shock proteins. CD4+ T-cell clones reactive with collagen type I were obtained from all four patients. Eighty percent of these clones had phenotypes resembling the mouse type 2 T helper (Th) phenotype, i.e., they produced high levels of interleukin-4 and low levels of gamma interferon. No collagen-type-I-reactive CD8+ clones were obtained. Bacterial-antigen-reactive CD4+ and/or CD8+ T-cell clones were also obtained from each patient, and the majority of the clones showed a Th0-like cytokine pattern and produced equal amounts of interleukin-4 and gamma interferon. Although most clones were reactive with P. intermedia, it seems that the immune response is not strictly directed against this particular microorganism, as clones reactive with one of the other bacteria were also obtained from two patients. We propose that collagen-specific CD4+ Th2-like T cells contribute to the chronicity of periodontitis but that their modes of activation might be controlled by Th0-like T cells specific for periodontitis-associated bacteria.",Sequence,cloning characterization antigen specificity tlymphocyte subset extracted gingival tissue chronic adult periodontitis patient chronic periodontitis characterized dense infiltration lymphocyte within gingival connective tissue distinct anaerobic gramnegative bacteria well autoimmunity collagen reported play role etiology pathogenesis disease describe cloning characterization cd cd lymphocyte isolated inflamed gingival tissue obtained four patient chronic periodontitis clone raised phytohemagglutinin interleukin tested proliferation response wholecell antigen porphyromonas gingivalis prevotella intermedia actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans human collagen type two bacterial heat shock protein cd tcell clone reactive collagen type obtained four patient eighty percent clone phenotype resembling mouse type helper th phenotype ie produced high level interleukin low level gamma interferon collagentypeireactive cd clone obtained bacterialantigenreactive cd andor cd tcell clone also obtained patient majority clone showed thlike cytokine pattern produced equal amount interleukin gamma interferon although clone reactive intermedia seems immune response strictly directed particular microorganism clone reactive one bacteria also obtained two patient propose collagenspecific cd thlike cell contribute chronicity periodontitis mode activation might controlled thlike cell specific periodontitisassociated bacteria
7539401,"Peptides with carboxyl-terminal sequence of alanine-proline: detection by a human monoclonal antibody. A human B lymphoblastoid cell line JWCI-L94 secretes an IgM human monoclonal antibody (HuMAb) that reacts with human melanoma cell lines, M14 and M12. To identify the antigenic epitope of this antibody, we screened lambda gt11 expression libraries constructed from M14 and M12. A total of 12 immunoreactive clones were isolated, and their DNA sequences were determined. The only sequence shared by all these clones was alanine-proline (A-P) at the carboxyl (C) terminal. HuMAb L94 reacted not only with C-terminal A-P-containing fusion proteins, but also with the synthetic dipeptide A-P. None of the peptides containing A-P internally or amino terminally reacted to HuMAb L94. Proline or alanine alone had no ability to bind to HuMAb L94. When alanine was replaced by glycine (G-P) or proline (P-P), the binding activity of these peptides was similar to that of A-P. On the other hand, when alanine was replaced by serine, valine, leucine, glutamine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, or hydroxyl proline, the resulting peptide completely lost the antigenic activity of HuMAb L94. These results demonstrate that HuMAb L94 recognizes C-terminal A-P, G-P, or P-P, and that a human antibody can recognize peptides as small as a two-amino acid residue.",Sequence,peptide carboxylterminal sequence alanineproline detection human monoclonal antibody human lymphoblastoid cell line jwcil secretes igm human monoclonal antibody humab reacts human melanoma cell line identify antigenic epitope antibody screened lambda gt expression library constructed total immunoreactive clone isolated dna sequence determined sequence shared clone alanineproline ap carboxyl terminal humab reacted cterminal apcontaining fusion protein also synthetic dipeptide ap none peptide containing ap internally amino terminally reacted humab proline alanine alone ability bind humab alanine replaced glycine gp proline pp binding activity peptide similar ap hand alanine replaced serine valine leucine glutamine lysine methionine phenylalanine hydroxyl proline resulting peptide completely lost antigenic activity humab result demonstrate humab recognizes cterminal ap gp pp human antibody recognize peptide small twoamino acid residue
7539381,"Separation and characterization of mobilized and unmobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells by counterflow centrifugal elutriation. Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvests are highly contaminated with lymphocytes. In allogeneic transplantations with PBSC, this might lead to an increased risk of graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD). Marrow graft T cells depletion (TCD) by counterflow centrifugal elutriation (CCE) has been performed to decrease the incidence of GVHD, but in some cases, it has also led to a reduction in the PBSC content of the graft due to the distinct elutriation properties of these cells. We studied the ability of CCE to deplete lymphocytes from recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF)-mobilized PB mononuclear cells (PBMNC) and from unmobilized PBMNC from healthy volunteers. We characterized the elutriation properties of circulating mobilized and unmobilized hematopoietic progenitors. With an experimental three-flow rate CCE procedure, originally described for separation of bone marrow, fractions 24, 28, and Rotor Off (RO) were obtained without impairing yield or viability. This CCE procedure can also be used for the separation of PBMNC harvests by reducing the T cell contamination to or below the range seen in bone marrow grafts; CD3+ cell contamination in the RO fractions of mobilized and unmobilized PBMNC was reduced to < 10% of the input. This could bring allogeneic PBSCT within the range of feasibility. In unmobilized PBMNC, 25% of the recovered CD34+ cells were found in fraction 24, where no colonies were detected, and 50% of the recovered CD34+ cells were found in fraction RO, where most of the colonies were detected. In mobilized PBMNC, 80% of the recovered CD34+ cells were found in fraction RO, together with 90% of the colonies, but almost no colonies or CD34+ cells were detected in fraction 24. CD34+ cells in fraction 24 expressed less CD13, and antigen found on more mature myeloid cells. Mobilization with rhG-CSF causes a shift of CD34+ cells from smaller cells (fraction 24) to larger cells (fractions 28 and RO).",Sequence,separation characterization mobilized unmobilized peripheral blood progenitor cell counterflow centrifugal elutriation peripheral blood stem cell pbsc harvest highly contaminated lymphocyte allogeneic transplantation pbsc might lead increased risk graftvshost disease gvhd marrow graft cell depletion tcd counterflow centrifugal elutriation cce performed decrease incidence gvhd case also led reduction pbsc content graft due distinct elutriation property cell studied ability cce deplete lymphocyte recombinant human granulocyte colonystimulating factor rhgcsfmobilized pb mononuclear cell pbmnc unmobilized pbmnc healthy volunteer characterized elutriation property circulating mobilized unmobilized hematopoietic progenitor experimental threeflow rate cce procedure originally described separation bone marrow fraction rotor ro obtained without impairing yield viability cce procedure also used separation pbmnc harvest reducing cell contamination range seen bone marrow graft cd cell contamination ro fraction mobilized unmobilized pbmnc reduced input bring allogeneic pbsct within range feasibility unmobilized pbmnc recovered cd cell found fraction colony detected recovered cd cell found fraction ro colony detected mobilized pbmnc recovered cd cell found fraction ro together colony almost colony cd cell detected fraction cd cell fraction expressed le cd antigen found mature myeloid cell mobilization rhgcsf cause shift cd cell smaller cell fraction larger cell fraction ro

Compound 48/80 and substance P dose dependently elicited the scratching behavior, but histamine, capsaicin and dilute formalin were without significant effects at the doses examined.

7539376,"Evidence against direct activation of chloride secretion by carbachol in the rat distal colon. Carbachol (5 x 10(-5) mol.1-1) induced a biphasic increase in short-circuit current (Isc) consisting of an initial peak phase followed by a long-lasting plateau. Complete dependence on the presence of Cl- ions and sensitivity to bumetanide confirmed that carbachol induces Cl- secretion. The plateau phase was blocked by indomethacin, and both the plateau and the peak phase were suppressed in the combined presence of indomethacin and tetrodotoxin. Inhibition of the carbachol response could be overcome by agonists of the cAMP pathway like prostaglandin E2, forskolin or 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate. The increase in Isc was inhibited by a blocker of cAMP-activated Cl- channels, glibenclamide, but was resistant to an inhibitor of Ca(2+)-activated Cl- channels, 4,4'-diisothiocyanato-stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS). The K+ channel blockers Ba2+ and charybdotoxin inhibited the first and suppressed the second phase of the carbachol response, whereas a less specific K+ channel blocker, quinine, suppressed both phases. These results suggest that the dominant effect of carbachol in the intact colonic mucosa is an opening of Ca(2+)-dependent, charybdotoxin- and Ba(2+)-sensitive K+ channels, which leads to hyperpolarization of the epithelial cells. This stimulates Cl- secretion only if there are spontaneously open apical Cl- channels which are basically stimulated by a continuous release of neurotransmitters and prostaglandins. Only during the first phase of the carbachol effect is there indirect evidence for activation of a Cl- conductance synergistically with the cAMP pathway as shown by the increase in tissue conductance resistant to K+ channel blockers.",Sequence,evidence direct activation chloride secretion carbachol rat distal colon carbachol mol induced biphasic increase shortcircuit current isc consisting initial peak phase followed longlasting plateau complete dependence presence cl ion sensitivity bumetanide confirmed carbachol induces cl secretion plateau phase blocked indomethacin plateau peak phase suppressed combined presence indomethacin tetrodotoxin inhibition carbachol response overcome agonist camp pathway like prostaglandin forskolin chlorophenylthioadenosinecyclic monophosphate increase isc inhibited blocker campactivated cl channel glibenclamide resistant inhibitor caactivated cl channel diisothiocyanatostilbenedisulfonic acid dids channel blocker ba charybdotoxin inhibited first suppressed second phase carbachol response whereas le specific channel blocker quinine suppressed phase result suggest dominant effect carbachol intact colonic mucosa opening cadependent charybdotoxin basensitive channel lead hyperpolarization epithelial cell stimulates cl secretion spontaneously open apical cl channel basically stimulated continuous release neurotransmitter prostaglandin first phase carbachol effect indirect evidence activation cl conductance synergistically camp pathway shown increase tissue conductance resistant channel blocker
7539334,"Relationship of the expression of the S20 and L34 ribosomal proteins to polyamine biosynthesis in Escherichia coli. Polyamine biosynthesis in Escherichia coli is regulated transcriptionally and post-translationally. Antizyme and ribosomal proteins S20 and L34 participate in post-translational inhibition of the polyamine biosynthetic enzymes ornithine and arginine decarboxylase. The aim of the present study was to investigate the significance of S20 and L34 in polyamine regulation in vivo. In vivo overexpression of S20 and L34 lowered the activities of ornithine and arginine decarboxylases and decreased total polyamine production. The levels of cadaverine, a related diamine whose synthesis is not regulated by S20 and L34, did not decrease but increased. The diminished ornithine and arginine decarboxylase activities are shown to result from reversible post-translational inhibition since the enzymes could be reactivated to normal levels upon titration of the inhibitors. The effects were specific as overexpression of eight other ribosomal proteins had no influence. Overexpression of ornithine decarboxylase results in elevated polyamine production and it increases S20 and L34 levels but not those of other ribosomal proteins. Ornithine depletion decreases S20 and L34 to normal levels in the ornithine decarboxylase overproducing cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments coupled with immunoblots indicated that ornithine and arginine decarboxylases physically interact with S20 and L34. This study shows that ribosomal proteins S20 and L34 can inhibit ornithine and arginine decarboxylases and polyamine biosynthesis in vivo. It is concluded that, unlike other basic ribosomal proteins and polycationic compounds which inhibit the activities of these enzymes only in vitro, S20 and L34 are biologically relevant in the regulation of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway.",Sequence,relationship expression ribosomal protein polyamine biosynthesis escherichia coli polyamine biosynthesis escherichia coli regulated transcriptionally posttranslationally antizyme ribosomal protein participate posttranslational inhibition polyamine biosynthetic enzyme ornithine arginine decarboxylase aim present study investigate significance polyamine regulation vivo vivo overexpression lowered activity ornithine arginine decarboxylase decreased total polyamine production level cadaverine related diamine whose synthesis regulated decrease increased diminished ornithine arginine decarboxylase activity shown result reversible posttranslational inhibition since enzyme reactivated normal level upon titration inhibitor effect specific overexpression eight ribosomal protein influence overexpression ornithine decarboxylase result elevated polyamine production increase level ribosomal protein ornithine depletion decrease normal level ornithine decarboxylase overproducing cell immunoprecipitation experiment coupled immunoblots indicated ornithine arginine decarboxylase physically interact study show ribosomal protein inhibit ornithine arginine decarboxylase polyamine biosynthesis vivo concluded unlike basic ribosomal protein polycationic compound inhibit activity enzyme vitro biologically relevant regulation polyamine biosynthetic pathway
7539008,"SPARC mediates focal adhesion disassembly in endothelial cells through a follistatin-like region and the Ca(2+)-binding EF-hand. SPARC is a one of a group of extracellular matrix proteins that regulate cell adhesion through a loss of focal adhesion plaques from spread cells. We previously reported that SPARC reduced the number of bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells positive for focal adhesions [Murphy-Ullrich et al. (1991): J Cell Biol 115:1127-1136]. We have now characterized the effect of SPARC on the cytoskeleton of BAE cells. Addition of SPARC to spread BAE cells caused a dose-dependent loss of focal adhesion-positive cells, that was maximal at approximately 1 microgram/ml (0.03 microM). Consistent with the loss of adhesion plaques as detected by interference reflection microscopy, vinculin appeared diffuse and F-actin was redistributed to the periphery of cells incubated with SPARC. However, the distribution of the integrin alpha v beta 3 remained clustered in a plaque-like distribution. These data, and the observation that SPARC binds to BAE cells but not to the extracellular matrix, indicate that SPARC acts via interactions with cell surface molecules and not by steric/physical disruption of integrin-extracellular matrix ligands. To determine the region(s) of SPARC that mediate a loss of focal adhesions, we tested peptides from the four distinct regions of SPARC. The cationic, cysteine-rich peptide 2.1 (amino acids 54-73) and the Ca(2+)-binding EF-hand-containing peptide 4.2 (amino acids 254-273) were active in focal adhesion disassembly. Furthermore, antibodies specific for these regions neutralized the focal adhesion-labilizing activity of SPARC. These results are consistent with previous data showing that peptide 2.1 and 4.2 interact with BAE cell surface proteins and indicate that the loss of focal adhesions from endothelial cells exposed to SPARC is a receptor-mediated event.",Sequence,sparc mediates focal adhesion disassembly endothelial cell follistatinlike region cabinding efhand sparc one group extracellular matrix protein regulate cell adhesion loss focal adhesion plaque spread cell previously reported sparc reduced number bovine aortic endothelial bae cell positive focal adhesion murphyullrich et al cell biol characterized effect sparc cytoskeleton bae cell addition sparc spread bae cell caused dosedependent loss focal adhesionpositive cell maximal approximately microgramml microm consistent loss adhesion plaque detected interference reflection microscopy vinculin appeared diffuse factin redistributed periphery cell incubated sparc however distribution integrin alpha beta remained clustered plaquelike distribution data observation sparc bind bae cell extracellular matrix indicate sparc act via interaction cell surface molecule stericphysical disruption integrinextracellular matrix ligand determine region sparc mediate loss focal adhesion tested peptide four distinct region sparc cationic cysteinerich peptide amino acid cabinding efhandcontaining peptide amino acid active focal adhesion disassembly furthermore antibody specific region neutralized focal adhesionlabilizing activity sparc result consistent previous data showing peptide interact bae cell surface protein indicate loss focal adhesion endothelial cell exposed sparc receptormediated event
7539006,"pp60src-mediated phosphorylation of connexin 43, a gap junction protein. Several laboratories have demonstrated a decrease in gap junctional communication in cells transformed by the src oncogene of the Rous sarcoma virus. The decrease in gap junctional communication was associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of the gap junction protein, connexin 43 (Cx43). This study was initiated to determine if the phosphorylation of Cx43 is the result of a direct kinase-substrate interaction between the highly active tyrosine kinase, pp60v-src, and Cx43. Previous biochemical studies have been limited by the low levels of Cx43 protein in fibroblast cell lines. To obtain larger quantities of Cx43, we constructed a recombinant baculovirus expressing Cx43 in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9) cells and subsequently purified the expressed Cx43 by immunoaffinity chromatography. We observed that this partially purified Cx43 was phosphorylated on tyrosine in vitro in the presence of kinase-active pp60src. Phosphotryptic peptide mapping indicated that the in vitro phosphorylated Cx43 contained phosphopeptides which comigrated with a subset of tryptic peptides prepared from Cx43 phosphorylated in vivo. Furthermore, coinfection of Sf-9 cells with recombinant baculoviruses encoding pp60v-src and Cx43 resulted in the accumulation of phosphotyrosine in Cx43. Taken together, the evidence presented in this paper demonstrates that kinase active pp60c-src is capable of phosphorylating Cx43 in a direct manner. Since the presence of phosphotyrosine on Cx43 is correlated with the down-regulation of gap-junctional communication, these results suggest that pp60v-src regulates gap junctional gating activity via tyrosine phosphorylation of Cx43.",Sequence,ppsrcmediated phosphorylation connexin gap junction protein several laboratory demonstrated decrease gap junctional communication cell transformed src oncogene rous sarcoma virus decrease gap junctional communication associated tyrosine phosphorylation gap junction protein connexin cx study initiated determine phosphorylation cx result direct kinasesubstrate interaction highly active tyrosine kinase ppvsrc cx previous biochemical study limited low level cx protein fibroblast cell line obtain larger quantity cx constructed recombinant baculovirus expressing cx spodoptera frugiperda sf cell subsequently purified expressed cx immunoaffinity chromatography observed partially purified cx phosphorylated tyrosine vitro presence kinaseactive ppsrc phosphotryptic peptide mapping indicated vitro phosphorylated cx contained phosphopeptides comigrated subset tryptic peptide prepared cx phosphorylated vivo furthermore coinfection sf cell recombinant baculoviruses encoding ppvsrc cx resulted accumulation phosphotyrosine cx taken together evidence presented paper demonstrates kinase active ppcsrc capable phosphorylating cx direct manner since presence phosphotyrosine cx correlated downregulation gapjunctional communication result suggest ppvsrc regulates gap junctional gating activity via tyrosine phosphorylation cx
7539001,"Mutant (delta F508) cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl- channel is functional when retained in endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian cells. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a plasma membrane-localized chloride channel. Some mutations in CFTR, including one which affects most patients (delta F508-CFTR), prevent CFTR from exiting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it is synthesized. To examine whether normal and mutant CFTRs function as chloride channels when they reside in the ER, the patch clamp technique was used to measure currents in the outer membrane of nuclei isolated from mammalian cells expressing CFTR. Both delta F508-CFTR as well as CFTR were revealed to function as cAMP-regulated chloride channels in native ER membrane. These results represent the first demonstrations of functional activity of CFTR in the biosynthetic pathway and suggest that conformational changes in the mutant protein, although recognized by ER-retention mechanisms, do not necessarily affect CFTR chloride channel properties, which may have implications for pathophysiology and therapeutic interventions in cystic fibrosis.",Sequence,mutant delta cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cl channel functional retained endoplasmic reticulum mammalian cell cystic fibrosis caused mutation gene encoding cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr plasma membranelocalized chloride channel mutation cftr including one affect patient delta fcftr prevent cftr exiting endoplasmic reticulum er synthesized examine whether normal mutant cftr function chloride channel reside er patch clamp technique used measure current outer membrane nucleus isolated mammalian cell expressing cftr delta fcftr well cftr revealed function campregulated chloride channel native er membrane result represent first demonstration functional activity cftr biosynthetic pathway suggest conformational change mutant protein although recognized erretention mechanism necessarily affect cftr chloride channel property may implication pathophysiology therapeutic intervention cystic fibrosis
7538975,"Expression of E-selectin on endothelial cells of small veins in human colorectal cancer. E-selectin is an adhesion molecule of endothelial cells that binds to cancer cells mediated by sialyl Lewis A (sLea) or sialyl Lewis X (sLe(x)). It is suspected to be involved in hematogenous metastasis of tumors. Therefore, it is worth examining E-selectin expression in human colorectal cancer and its hepatic metastasis. In the present study, E-selectin was clearly revealed on the endothelial cells of small vessels adjacent to cancer nests both in primary and in metastatic nests in immunohistochemistry. In these tissues, E-selectin was observed on the endothelial cells lining the lumen of small vessels. Its expression adjacent to cancer nests appears to be induced through some stimuli by cancer cells, since its degree of expression is inversely correlated to the distance of the blood vessels from the cancer nests (p < 0.001). Endothelial cells adjacent to the metastatic lesion expressed E-selectin more extensively than those adjacent to the primary foci. This is also in line with the finding on serum E-selectin levels which were significantly elevated in the metastatic group as compared with the non-metastatic group.

An elevation in the level of lipid peroxides in nuclear, mitochondrial and microsomal fractions of chick liver was recorded 6 hr after hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH; 50 mg/kg body wt., ip) treatment. The magnitude of increase remained more or less same even 24 hr after the pesticide treatment. Total glutathione content also increased by 6 hr of HCH treatment and did not change even 24 hr after the pesticide treatment. Protein content of crude homogenate and 10000 g supernatant decreased significantly 6 hr after the pesticide treatment. The magnitude of decrease was more or less same even 24 hr after the pesticide treatment. Although cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase and catalase activities (expressed as units/mg protein) did not change 24 hr after HCH treatment, a small but significant increase in superoxide dismutase activity was recorded 6 hr after HCH treatment. On the other hand when activities were expressed as units/mg tissue wt., a significant decrease in the activities of both the enzymes was recorded 6 and 24 hr after HCH treatment. Therefore, the decrease in the activities of both the enzymes in response to HCH in chick liver may be due to decrease in tissue protein content in general rather than specific decrease in the activities of the enzymes.",Sequence,hexachlorocyclohexaneinduced change lipid peroxidation superoxide dismutase catalase activity glutathione content chick liver elevation level lipid peroxide nuclear mitochondrial microsomal fraction chick liver recorded hr hexachlorocyclohexane hch mgkg body wt ip treatment magnitude increase remained le even hr pesticide treatment total glutathione content also increased hr hch treatment change even hr pesticide treatment protein content crude homogenate supernatant decreased significantly hr pesticide treatment magnitude decrease le even hr pesticide treatment although cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase catalase activity expressed unitsmg protein change hr hch treatment small significant increase superoxide dismutase activity recorded hr hch treatment hand activity expressed unitsmg tissue wt significant decrease activity enzyme recorded hr hch treatment therefore decrease activity enzyme response hch chick liver may due decrease tissue protein content general rather specific decrease activity enzyme

Two monoclonal antibodies, GLU-1 and A1.6, raised against gamma-L-glutamyl-L-glutamic acid dipeptide (Glu-Glu) and Ca(2+)-dependent ATPase from Paramecium, respectively, recognized the dipeptide Glu-Glu sequence. Whereas the antibodies immunofluorescently stained very few, if any, cytoskeletal fibers in cultured mammalian cells, almost all interphase as well as mitotic spindle microtubules became visible after treatment of cells with carboxypeptidase A. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated intense cross-reaction of the antibodies to the alpha-tubulin subunit. alpha-Tubulin isotypes produced as fusion proteins in bacteria were labeled by both the antibodies only when the proteins did not contain a tyrosine residue at the C terminus, indicating that GLU-1 and A1.6 specifically recognize the detyrosinated form of alpha-tubulin. When microtubule protein purified from brain was probed, not only alpha-but also, to a lesser extent, beta-tubulin were revealed by the dipeptide antibodies. A synthetic tripeptide YED containing one glutamyl group linked to the second residue of the peptide via the gamma position was also recognized by the antibodies. Since this peptide sequence corresponds to the amino acid sequence of polyglutamyated class III beta isotype at amino acid position 437 to 439, it is suggested that GLU-1 and A1.6 are able to recognize the glutamylated form of beta-tubulin. These results indicate that the C-terminal Glu-Glu sequence displays strong antigenicity, and the antibodies recognize the sequence present in the C terminus of the detyrosinated form of alpha-tubulin and the glutamyl side chain of beta-tubulin.

7536046,"Expression of c-kit receptor and its autophosphorylation in immature rat type A spermatogonia. The objective of this study was to examine the expression and activation of the c-kit receptor, a specific receptor for kit ligand (stem cell factor, steel factor), in rat type A spermatogonia. Testes were obtained from 9-day-old rats, decapsulated, and then subjected to sequential enzymatic digestion. The mixture of testicular cell types was then separated by sedimentation velocity at unit gravity. The isolated type A spermatogonia were characterized by light and electron microscopy. They exhibited spherical nuclei containing several nucleoli and associated chromatin clumps and organelles generally in a perinuclear location similar to that found in the in vivo 9-day-old testis. The synthesis of the c-kit receptor by the spermatogonia was established by hybridization of total RNA with a specific cDNA for mouse c-kit receptor. Two mRNA transcripts migrating at 4.8 kb and 12 kb were observed. Localization of the c-kit receptor in the isolated cells was determined by immunocytochemistry using an antibody to c-kit protein. Specific staining for c-kit receptor was observed in the cytoplasm of the isolated type A spermatogonia. Furthermore, the presence of the c-kit receptor protein in the spermatogonia was confirmed by Western blot analysis using the same antibody. The antibody recognized the c-kit receptor at approximately 160 kDa. In an attempt to determine whether this receptor has a functional significance, we examined the effect of kit ligand on the phosphorylation of the c-kit receptor. The c-kit receptor appeared to be constitutively autophosphorylated on tyrosine at low basal levels, and upon stimulation with kit ligand, the amount of phosphorylated protein increased significantly. These observations indicate that kit ligand induces autophosphorylation of the c-kit receptor, which may lead to the activation of other cellular target proteins responsible for spermatogonial proliferation and/or differentiation.",Sequence,expression ckit receptor autophosphorylation immature rat type spermatogonia objective study examine expression activation ckit receptor specific receptor kit ligand stem cell factor steel factor rat type spermatogonia testis obtained dayold rat decapsulated subjected sequential enzymatic digestion mixture testicular cell type separated sedimentation velocity unit gravity isolated type spermatogonia characterized light electron microscopy exhibited spherical nucleus containing several nucleolus associated chromatin clump organelle generally perinuclear location similar found vivo dayold testis synthesis ckit receptor spermatogonia established hybridization total rna specific cdna mouse ckit receptor two mrna transcript migrating kb kb observed localization ckit receptor isolated cell determined immunocytochemistry using antibody ckit protein specific staining ckit receptor observed cytoplasm isolated type spermatogonia furthermore presence ckit receptor protein spermatogonia confirmed western blot analysis using antibody antibody recognized ckit receptor approximately kda attempt determine whether receptor functional significance examined effect kit ligand phosphorylation ckit receptor ckit receptor appeared constitutively autophosphorylated tyrosine low basal level upon stimulation kit ligand amount phosphorylated protein increased significantly observation indicate kit ligand induces autophosphorylation ckit receptor may lead activation cellular target protein responsible spermatogonial proliferation andor differentiation
7534483,"Regulation of thymosin beta 4 mRNA levels during cell proliferation. The levels of thymosin beta 4 mRNA were studied throughout the cell cycle of NIH 3T3 cells. In serum deprived, quiescent cells, the levels of thymosin beta 4 were undetectable; after serum restoration, the cells were induced to proliferate and we found a pronounced increase in thymosin beta 4 mRNA levels at the G1/S transition. Thymosin beta 4 mRNA was induced even in the presence of cycloheximide. On the other hand, cycling cells that were synchronized at different stages of the cycle by means of mitotic shake-off after nocodazole arrest or a double thymidine block did not show any variation in the levels of thymosin beta 4 mRNA when they progressed synchronously through the cycle. In conclusion, the present data indicate that the thymosin beta 4 gene is regulated by cell proliferation but it is not a cell cycle-regulated gene. Finally, we studied thymosin beta 4 mRNA stability by inhibiting thymosin beta 4 gene transcription with actinomycin D. Our results suggest that thymosin beta 4 mRNA has a pronounced stability, a fact that might be relevant to account for the presence of thymosin beta 4 in enucleated cells like platelets.",Sequence,regulation thymosin beta mrna level cell proliferation level thymosin beta mrna studied throughout cell cycle nih cell serum deprived quiescent cell level thymosin beta undetectable serum restoration cell induced proliferate found pronounced increase thymosin beta mrna level g transition thymosin beta mrna induced even presence cycloheximide hand cycling cell synchronized different stage cycle mean mitotic shakeoff nocodazole arrest double thymidine block show variation level thymosin beta mrna progressed synchronously cycle conclusion present data indicate thymosin beta gene regulated cell proliferation cell cycleregulated gene finally studied thymosin beta mrna stability inhibiting thymosin beta gene transcription actinomycin result suggest thymosin beta mrna pronounced stability fact might relevant account presence thymosin beta enucleated cell like platelet
7534478,"Permutation of a pair of tertiary nucleotides in a transfer RNA. The tertiary nucleotides at positions 15 and 48 in a tRNA establish non-Watson-Crick hydrogen interactions that connect the dihydrouridine (D) loop with the variable loop and stabilize the ""L""-shaped tRNA structure. Although the majority of tRNAs have G15.C48 or A15.U48, all of the 16 possible nucleotide pairs at positions 15 and 48 can be found in the existing cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNA sequences. Because tRNAs contain a variety of slightly different sets of tertiary nucleotides, this complexity raises the question of whether a given tRNA sequence framework can accommodate all of the 16 compositions at positions 15 and 48. In this work, G15 and C48 in an Escherichia coli alanine amber suppressor tRNA were permuted, and variants were tested for biological activity in vivo. All but an A15.A48 variant were functional, indicating substantial flexibility at positions 15 and 48 to accommodate nucleotide variations. Analysis of the A15.A48 variant with chemical probes showed that this mutant harbors a defect that specifically changes the conformation of the anticodon sequence. Interestingly, human tRNA(Ala) has A15.A48. Additional nucleotide substitutions in E. coli A15.A48 tRNA(Ala) that recreate the D loop sequence of human tRNA(Ala) restored the biological activity to this tRNA by reestablishing the wild-type conformation of the anticodon sequence. The results suggest a distal relationship between the D and the anticodon loops in a tRNA and delineate covariation of specific nucleotides in the evolution of tRNA(Ala) from E. coli to human.",Sequence,permutation pair tertiary nucleotide transfer rna tertiary nucleotide position trna establish nonwatsoncrick hydrogen interaction connect dihydrouridine loop variable loop stabilize lshaped trna structure although majority trna gc au possible nucleotide pair position found existing cytoplasmic mitochondrial trna sequence trna contain variety slightly different set tertiary nucleotide complexity raise question whether given trna sequence framework accommodate composition position work escherichia coli alanine amber suppressor trna permuted variant tested biological activity vivo aa variant functional indicating substantial flexibility position accommodate nucleotide variation analysis aa variant chemical probe showed mutant harbor defect specifically change conformation anticodon sequence interestingly human trnaala aa additional nucleotide substitution coli aa trnaala recreate loop sequence human trnaala restored biological activity trna reestablishing wildtype conformation anticodon sequence result suggest distal relationship anticodon loop trna delineate covariation specific nucleotide evolution trnaala coli human
7534461,"Expression of beta 1 integrin receptors in transformed mouse epidermal keratinocytes: upregulation of alpha 5 beta 1 in spindle carcinoma cells. The adhesive properties and the expression of extracellular matrix receptors of the beta 1-integrin subfamily were analyzed in transformed epidermal keratinocyte cell lines of different stages of mouse skin carcinogenesis. One- and two-dimensional analyses of the immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-beta 1- and specific anti-alpha-integrin subunits showed qualitative and quantitative changes in the expression of beta 1 integrins by the different cell lines. The polyvalent alpha 3 beta 1 integrin was expressed by all analyzed cell lines, although the levels detected in undifferentiated spindle CarC cells were lower than those present in the rest of keratinocyte cell lines. In contrast, spindle cells expressed high levels of the specific fibronectin receptor alpha 5 beta 1, whereas this integrin was absent or expressed at very reduced levels in the other epithelial cell lines. Expression of alpha 5 beta 1 integrin in spindle cells appeared organized in cell-substratum contact areas on spread cells. In addition, high and homogenous expression of alpha 5 beta 1 was detected in fully undifferentiated tumors induced in nude mice by three independent spindle cell lines. These results suggest that the expression of alpha 5 beta 1 integrin is upregulated during the development of spindle cell carcinomas that occur in the last stages of mouse skin carcinogenesis and can be associated with the acquisition of the fibroblastoid phenotype of spindle cells. On the other hand, expression of the collagen receptor alpha 2 beta 1 was demonstrated in a transformed cell line (PDV), and it was apparently also expressed in two other malignant keratinocyte cell lines (PDVC57 and HaCa4).

Extracorporeal circulation with exposure of blood to foreign surfaces causes activation of different defense systems, eg, white cells. Several potent mediators are released into plasma, capable of causing harmful effects to different organs, contributing to postoperative morbidity after operations using cardiopulmonary bypass. The eosinophil granulocyte has not previously been investigated in this respect.

In 17 control patients, plasma levels of eosinophil cationic protein and eosinophil protein X increased considerably during cardiopulmonary bypass.

7533858,"Identification of a membrane fusion domain and an oligomerization domain in the baculovirus GP64 envelope fusion protein. The baculovirus GP64 envelope fusion protein (GP64 EFP) is the major envelope glycoprotein of the budded virion and has been shown to mediate acid-triggered membrane fusion both in virions and when expressed alone in transfected cells. Using site-directed mutagenesis and functional assays for oligomerization, transport, and membrane fusion, we localized two functional domains of GP64 EFP. To identify a fusion domain in the GP64 EFP of the Orgyia pseudotsugata multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus (OpMNPV), we examined two hydrophobic regions in the GP64 EFP ectodomain. Hydrophobic region I (amino acids 223 to 228) is a cluster of 6 hydrophobic amino acids exhibiting the highest local hydrophobicity in the ectodomain. Hydrophobic region II (amino acids 330 to 338) lies within a conserved region of GP64 EFP that contains a heptad repeat of leucine residues and is predicted to form an amphipathic alpha-helix. In region I, nonconservative amino acid substitutions at Leu-226 and Leu-227 (at the center of the hydrophobic cluster) completely abolished fusion activity but did not prevent GP64 EFP oligomerization or surface localization. To confirm the role of region I in membrane fusion activity, we used a synthetic 21-amino-acid peptide to generate polyclonal antibodies against region I and demonstrated that antipeptide antibodies were capable of both neutralizing membrane fusion activity and reducing infectivity of the virus. In hydrophobic region II, mutations were designed to disrupt several structural characteristics: a heptad repeat of leucine, a predicted alpha-helix, or the local hydrophobicity along one face of the helix. Single alanine substitutions for heptad leucines did not prevent oligomerization, transport, or fusion activity. However, multiple alanine substitutions or proline (helix-destabilizing) substitutions disrupted both oligomerization and transport of GP64 EFP. In addition, a deletion that removed region II and the predicted alpha-helix was defective for oligomerization, whereas a larger deletion that retained region II and the predicted helix was oligomerized. These results indicate that region II is required for oligomerization and transport and suggest that the predicted helical structure of this region may be important for this function. Thus, by using mutagenesis, functional assays, and antibody inhibition, two functional domains were localized within the baculovirus GP64 EFP: a fusion domain located at amino acids 223 to 228 and an oligomerization domain located at amino acids 327 to 335 within a predicted amphipathic alpha-helix.",Sequence,identification membrane fusion domain oligomerization domain baculovirus gp envelope fusion protein baculovirus gp envelope fusion protein gp efp major envelope glycoprotein budded virion shown mediate acidtriggered membrane fusion virion expressed alone transfected cell using sitedirected mutagenesis functional assay oligomerization transport membrane fusion localized two functional domain gp efp identify fusion domain gp efp orgyia pseudotsugata multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus opmnpv examined two hydrophobic region gp efp ectodomain hydrophobic region amino acid cluster hydrophobic amino acid exhibiting highest local hydrophobicity ectodomain hydrophobic region ii amino acid lie within conserved region gp efp contains heptad repeat leucine residue predicted form amphipathic alphahelix region nonconservative amino acid substitution leu leu center hydrophobic cluster completely abolished fusion activity prevent gp efp oligomerization surface localization confirm role region membrane fusion activity used synthetic aminoacid peptide generate polyclonal antibody region demonstrated antipeptide antibody capable neutralizing membrane fusion activity reducing infectivity virus hydrophobic region ii mutation designed disrupt several structural characteristic heptad repeat leucine predicted alphahelix local hydrophobicity along one face helix single alanine substitution heptad leucine prevent oligomerization transport fusion activity however multiple alanine substitution proline helixdestabilizing substitution disrupted oligomerization transport gp efp addition deletion removed region ii predicted alphahelix defective oligomerization whereas larger deletion retained region ii predicted helix oligomerized result indicate region ii required oligomerization transport suggest predicted helical structure region may important function thus using mutagenesis functional assay antibody inhibition two functional domain localized within baculovirus gp efp fusion domain located amino acid oligomerization domain located amino acid within predicted amphipathic alphahelix
7533853,"Upregulation of integrins alpha v beta 3 and alpha v beta 5 on human monocytes and T lymphocytes facilitates adenovirus-mediated gene delivery. Entry of human adenovirus into host cells involves interaction of virus particles with two distinct receptors. The initial binding event is mediated by the fiber protein, while subsequent interaction of the penton base protein with alpha v integrins promotes virus internalization and/or penetration. Although these interactions in epithelial and endothelial cells have been well characterized, relatively little is known as to whether these events occur during virus infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We demonstrate that freshly isolated peripheral blood monocytes and T lymphocytes express very small amounts of alpha v integrins and also are resistant to adenovirus infection. Exposure of monocytes to hematopoietic growth factors granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage colony-stimulating factor induced expression of cell surface alpha v integrins, promoted the binding of penton base protein, and also rendered these cells susceptible to adenovirus-mediated gene delivery. Stimulation of T cells with a mitogen, phytohemagglutinin, or a cell-activating agent, phorbol myristate acetate, induced expression of alpha v integrins and also enhanced adenovirus-mediated gene delivery. These studies further indicate that alpha v integrins play a crucial role in adenovirus infection and also provide a useful strategy for enhancing adenovirus-mediated gene delivery into human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",Sequence,upregulation integrins alpha beta alpha beta human monocyte lymphocyte facilitates adenovirusmediated gene delivery entry human adenovirus host cell involves interaction virus particle two distinct receptor initial binding event mediated fiber protein subsequent interaction penton base protein alpha integrins promotes virus internalization andor penetration although interaction epithelial endothelial cell well characterized relatively little known whether event occur virus infection human peripheral blood mononuclear cell demonstrate freshly isolated peripheral blood monocyte lymphocyte express small amount alpha integrins also resistant adenovirus infection exposure monocyte hematopoietic growth factor granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor macrophage colonystimulating factor induced expression cell surface alpha integrins promoted binding penton base protein also rendered cell susceptible adenovirusmediated gene delivery stimulation cell mitogen phytohemagglutinin cellactivating agent phorbol myristate acetate induced expression alpha integrins also enhanced adenovirusmediated gene delivery study indicate alpha integrins play crucial role adenovirus infection also provide useful strategy enhancing adenovirusmediated gene delivery human peripheral blood mononuclear cell
7532686,"Role of 4-1BB ligand in costimulation of T lymphocyte growth and its upregulation on M12 B lymphomas by cAMP. K46J B lymphomas express a T cell costimulatory activity that is not inhibited by CTLA-4Ig, anti-B7-1, anti-B7-2, anti-intercellular adhesion molecule 1 or antibodies to heat stable antigen. In this paper we report that this costimulatory activity is mediated at least in part by 4-1BB ligand, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene family that binds to 4-1BB, a T cell activation antigen with homology to the TNF/nerve growth factor receptor family. A fusion protein between 4-1BB and alkaline phosphatase (4-1BB-AP) blocks T cell activation by K46J lymphomas in both an antigen-specific system and with polyclonally (anti-CD3) activated T cells. 4-1BB-AP also blocks antigen presentation by normal spleen cells. When the antigen-presenting cells express B7 molecules as well as 4-1BB ligand, we find that B7 molecules and 4-1BB-AP both contribute to T cell activation. These data suggest that 4-1BB ligand plays an important role in costimulation of IL-2 production and proliferation by T cells. The B lymphoma M12 expresses low levels of 4-1BB-L but can be induced to express higher levels by treatment of the B cells with cAMP, which also induces B7-1 and B7-2 in these cells. Thus cAMP appears to coordinately induce several costimulatory molecules on B cells.",Sequence,role bb ligand costimulation lymphocyte growth upregulation lymphoma camp kj lymphoma express cell costimulatory activity inhibited ctlaig antib antib antiintercellular adhesion molecule antibody heat stable antigen paper report costimulatory activity mediated least part bb ligand member tumor necrosis factor tnf gene family bind bb cell activation antigen homology tnfnerve growth factor receptor family fusion protein bb alkaline phosphatase bbap block cell activation kj lymphoma antigenspecific system polyclonally anticd activated cell bbap also block antigen presentation normal spleen cell antigenpresenting cell express molecule well bb ligand find molecule bbap contribute cell activation data suggest bb ligand play important role costimulation il production proliferation cell lymphoma express low level bbl induced express higher level treatment cell camp also induces cell thus camp appears coordinately induce several costimulatory molecule cell
7532677,"The Bw4 public epitope of HLA-B molecules confers reactivity with natural killer cell clones that express NKB1, a putative HLA receptor. Although inhibition of natural killer (NK) cell-mediated lysis by the class I HLA molecules of target cells is an established phenomenon, knowledge of the features of class I molecules which induce this effect remains rudimentary. Using class I alleles HLA-B*1502 and B*1513 which differ only at residues 77-83 which define the Bw4 and Bw6 serological epitopes, we tested the hypothesis that the presence of the Bw4 epitope on class I molecules determines recognition by NKB1+ NK cells. HLA-B*1513 possesses the Bw4 epitope, whereas B*1502 has the Bw6 epitope. Lysis by NKB1+ NK cell clones of transfected target cells expressing B*1513 as the only HLA-A, -B, or -C molecule was inhibited, whereas killing of transfectants expressing B*1502 was not. Addition of an an anti-NKB1 monoclonal antibody reconstituted lysis of the targets expressing B*1513, but did not affect killing of targets bearing B*1502. The inhibitory effect of B*1513 could be similarly prevented by the addition of an anti-class I monoclonal antibody. These results show that the presence of the Bw4 epitope influences recognition of HLA-B molecules by NK cells that express NKB1, and suggest that the NKB1 molecule may act as a receptor for Bw4+ HLA-B alleles. Sequences outside of the Bw4 region must also affect recognition by NKB1+ NK cells, because lysis of transfectants expressing HLA-A*2403 or A*2501, which possess the Bw4 epitope but are in other ways substantially different from HLA-B molecules, was not increased by addition of the anti-NKB1 antibody. Asparagine 86, the single site of N-linked glycosylation on class I molecules, is in close proximity to the Bw4/Bw6 region. The glycosylation site of the Bw4-positive molecule B*5801 was mutated, and the mutant molecules tested for inhibition of NKB1+ NK cells. Inhibition that could be reversed by addition of the anti-NKB1 monoclonal antibody was observed, showing the presence of the carbohydrate moiety is not essential for class I recognition by NKB1+ NK cell clones.",Sequence,bw public epitope hlab molecule confers reactivity natural killer cell clone express nkb putative hla receptor although inhibition natural killer nk cellmediated lysis class hla molecule target cell established phenomenon knowledge feature class molecule induce effect remains rudimentary using class allele hlab differ residue define bw bw serological epitope tested hypothesis presence bw epitope class molecule determines recognition nkb nk cell hlab posse bw epitope whereas bw epitope lysis nkb nk cell clone transfected target cell expressing hlaa molecule inhibited whereas killing transfectants expressing addition antinkb monoclonal antibody reconstituted lysis target expressing affect killing target bearing inhibitory effect similarly prevented addition anticlass monoclonal antibody result show presence bw epitope influence recognition hlab molecule nk cell express nkb suggest nkb molecule may act receptor bw hlab allele sequence outside bw region must also affect recognition nkb nk cell lysis transfectants expressing hlaa posse bw epitope way substantially different hlab molecule increased addition antinkb antibody asparagine single site nlinked glycosylation class molecule close proximity bwbw region glycosylation site bwpositive molecule mutated mutant molecule tested inhibition nkb nk cell inhibition reversed addition antinkb monoclonal antibody observed showing presence carbohydrate moiety essential class recognition nkb nk cell clone

Mature (3-4 months) and aged (18-19 months) Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were treated with 5-HT receptor agonists and drug-induced behaviours monitored. The 5-HT2/1C agonist, 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI), induced wet dog shakes and back muscle contractions which were significantly increased in aged, compared to mature, rats, suggesting an age-related enhancement of 5-HT2 receptor function. In contrast, the selective 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) induced forepaw treading, flat body posture, hypothermia and hyperactivity which were not significantly different in aged compared to mature rats. Levels of 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the hippocampus and frontal cortex were measured using high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. There were no age-related changes in hippocampal 5-HT or 5-HIAA.

7531818,"Inhibition of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter by pure and impure ruthenium red. Commercial ruthenium red is often purified by a single recrystallization as described by Luft, J.H. (1971) Anat Rec 171, 347-368, which yields small amounts of material having an apparent molar extinction coefficient of approximately 67,400 at 533 nm. A simple modification to the procedure dramatically improves the yield, allowing crystallization to be repeated. Three times recrystallized ruthenium red has an apparent extinction coefficient of approximately 85,900, the highest value reported to date. Both crude and highly purified ruthenium red can be shown to inhibit reverse activity of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (uncoupled mitochondria), provided that care is taken to minimize and account for Ca2+ release through the permeability transition pore. Crude ruthenium red is 7-10 fold more potent than the highly purified material in this regard, on an actual ruthenium red concentration basis. The same relative potency is seen against forward uniport (coupled mitochondria), however, the I50 values are 10 fold lower for both the crude and purified preparations. These data demonstrate unambiguously that the energy state of mitochondria affects the sensitivity of the Ca2+ uniporter to ruthenium red preparations, and that both the forward and reverse reactions are subject to complete inhibition. The data suggest, however, that the active inhibitor may not be ruthenium red per se, but one or more of the other ruthenium complexes which are present in ruthenium red preparations.",Sequence,inhibition mitochondrial ca uniporter pure impure ruthenium red commercial ruthenium red often purified single recrystallization described luft jh anat rec yield small amount material apparent molar extinction coefficient approximately nm simple modification procedure dramatically improves yield allowing crystallization repeated three time recrystallized ruthenium red apparent extinction coefficient approximately highest value reported date crude highly purified ruthenium red shown inhibit reverse activity mitochondrial ca uniporter uncoupled mitochondrion provided care taken minimize account ca release permeability transition pore crude ruthenium red fold potent highly purified material regard actual ruthenium red concentration basis relative potency seen forward uniport coupled mitochondrion however value fold lower crude purified preparation data demonstrate unambiguously energy state mitochondrion affect sensitivity ca uniporter ruthenium red preparation forward reverse reaction subject complete inhibition data suggest however active inhibitor may ruthenium red per se one ruthenium complex present ruthenium red preparation

The heteromeric mouse epsilon 2/zeta 1 N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and its channel properties were studied using both the outside-out patch-clamp and two-microelectrode voltage-clamp techniques. In the cloned receptor channel, permeation properties of monovalent and divalent cations, and voltage-dependent block by Mg2+ were similar to those reported previously in the native NMDA receptor channels. The sequence of single-channel conductances for alkali metals was Rb+ > Cs+ approximately K+ > Na+ > Li+, whereas the sequence of relative permeabilities was Cs+ > Rb+ > K+ approximately Na+ > Li+. The single-channel conductances measured in isotonic Ca2+, Sr2+ and Ba2+ solutions were almost equal, and approximately one-fifth of the value in the Na+ solution, although the permeabilities for these alkaline earth cations were higher than for Na+.

Stockholm, Sweden, May 12-13, 1993. As part of a WHO consensus conference on diagnosis and prognostic parameters in localized prostate cancer, a working group of experts discussed the role of various modern imaging techniques. Special attention was focused on transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) in combination with biopsies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using endorectal coil and recent advances in these techniques. Some experimental techniques, especially hormone receptor scintigraphy and positron emission tomography were also discussed and new results were presented. We concluded that MRI seems to be superior to other imaging techniques in the preoperative assessment of local tumor stage. TRUS defends its place in the diagnostic armament; it is easily combined with multiple biopsies, the results of which are important in the assessment of the biological aggressiveness of prostate cancer. The present development in the field of nuclear medicine may result in techniques for in vivo characterization of tumors and will most certainly have important implications for diagnosis of prostate cancer in the future.",Sequence,imaging diagnosis assessment prognosis localized prostate cancer consensus conference diagnosis prognostic parameter localized prostate cancer stockholm sweden may part consensus conference diagnosis prognostic parameter localized prostate cancer working group expert discussed role various modern imaging technique special attention focused transrectal ultrasound trus combination biopsy magnetic resonance imaging mri using endorectal coil recent advance technique experimental technique especially hormone receptor scintigraphy positron emission tomography also discussed new result presented concluded mri seems superior imaging technique preoperative assessment local tumor stage trus defends place diagnostic armament easily combined multiple biopsy result important assessment biological aggressiveness prostate cancer present development field nuclear medicine may result technique vivo characterization tumor certainly important implication diagnosis prostate cancer future

To evaluate the validity of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in identifying men who subsequently were or were not clinically diagnosed with prostate cancer, assess optimal test cutoff, measure lead time, and estimate relative risks (RRs) associated with discrete PSA levels. Nested case-control study of men providing plasma samples before a 10-year follow-up. The Physicians' Health Study, an ongoing randomized trial that enrolled 22,071 men aged 40 to 84 years in 1982. A total of 366 men (cases) diagnosed with prostate cancer and 1098 men (three controls per case), matched by age, randomly selected from all cohort members at risk at the time of case diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity for each year of follow-up and for aggressive and nonaggressive cancers separately. At a cutoff of 4.0 ng/mL, sensitivity for the entire 10-year follow-up was 46% for total cases. Sensitivities for detection of total, aggressive, and nonaggressive cancers occurring in the first 4 years were 73%, 87%, and 53%. Overall, specificity was 91% and changed little by year of follow-up. Optimal validity was achieved at a cutoff of 3.3 ng/mL. Estimated mean lead time for all cancers was 5.5 years. Only 40% of cancers detected more than 5 years from baseline were nonaggressive. Compared with men with PSA levels less than 1.0 ng/mL, those with PSA levels between 2.0 and 3.0 ng/mL had an RR of 5.5 (95% confidence interval, 3.7 to 9.2). A single PSA measurement had a relatively high sensitivity and specificity for detection of prostate cancers that arose within 4 years.

7529310,"Isoproterenol causes hyperpolarization through opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle of the canine saphenous vein. Experiments were designed to determine how isoproterenol affects the cell membrane potential of smooth muscle cells of the canine saphenous vein. Measurements of membrane potential were performed using glass microelectrodes. Isoproterenol (10(-9) to 10(-6) M) caused sustained, concentration-dependent membrane hyperpolarizations in tissues with and without endothelium. ICI 118,551 (a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist), but not atenolol (a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist), abolished the hyperpolarization to isoproterenol. Forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, produced sustained hyperpolarizations, which were not mimicked by 1,9-dideoxyforskolin. Incubation with either ouabain or extracellular K(+)-free solution did not inhibit the electrical response to isoproterenol. Glibenclamide (a selective ATP-sensitive K+ channel antagonist) attenuated the hyperpolarizations induced by either isoproterenol or forskolin, whereas charybdotoxin (an inhibitor of large conductance Ca(++)-activated K+ channels) did not. These findings suggest that isoproterenol opens ATP-sensitive K+ channels indirectly through activation of adenylate cyclase in the smooth muscle of the canine saphenous vein.

7529295,"DNA damage in bromodeoxyuridine substituted SV40 DNA and minichromosomes following UVA irradiation in the presence of Hoechst dye 33258. Bromodeoxyuridine-substituted SV40 DNA and SV40 minichromosomes were prepared from infected CV1 cells, and exposed to UVA light in the presence of different concentrations of Hoechst dye 33258. Following agarose gel electrophoresis, the yields of ssbs and dsbs were determined. In DNA these yields are dependent on the level of BrdU substitution (0.038 ssb and 0.00022 dsb per BrdU residue/kJm-2), and on the mode of dye binding (type I versus II). The yields of both ssbs and dsbs were found to be lower by factors of 1.25 and 2 respectively in minichromosomes. UVA irradiation in the presence of the thiol cysteamine results in lower strand break yields, presumably due to the repair of DNA radicals formed during photolysis. The thiol was found to react seven times more slowly with the DNA radicals than oxygen. The implications of these results are discussed in light of prior cellular studies.",Sequence,dna damage bromodeoxyuridine substituted sv dna minichromosomes following uva irradiation presence hoechst dye bromodeoxyuridinesubstituted sv dna sv minichromosomes prepared infected cv cell exposed uva light presence different concentration hoechst dye following agarose gel electrophoresis yield ssbs dsbs determined dna yield dependent level brdu substitution ssb dsb per brdu residuekjm mode dye binding type versus ii yield ssbs dsbs found lower factor respectively minichromosomes uva irradiation presence thiol cysteamine result lower strand break yield presumably due repair dna radical formed photolysis thiol found react seven time slowly dna radical oxygen implication result discussed light prior cellular study
7529288,"IL-13 selectively induces vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression in human endothelial cells. Previous studies with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) have shown that the cytokine IL-4 induces adherence of human eosinophils, but not neutrophils, because of its ability to selectively induce surface expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Because the cytokine IL-13 shares a number of biologic properties with IL-4, we examined the effect of IL-13 on the expression and function of adhesion molecules on HUVEC. Incubation of HUVEC for 4 to 48 h with IL-13 (0.1 to 15 U/ml) induced surface expression of VCAM-1, as detected by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, without significantly affecting expression of E-selectin or intercellular adhesion molecule-1. The kinetics and maximal IL-13-induced expression of VCAM-1 were similar to those seen with IL-4. Treatment of HUVEC with an optimal concentration of IL-13 (15 U/ml for 24 h) induced adhesiveness for eosinophils, but not for neutrophils, and adhesion was completely inhibited by mAb recognizing VCAM-1 or alpha 4 integrin (CD49d). These results demonstrate that IL-13, like IL-4, selectively stimulates HUVEC to express functional cell surface VCAM-1 and suggest a possible role for IL-13 in promoting VCAM-1/alpha 4 integrin-dependent accumulation of eosinophils during allergic and other inflammatory reactions in vivo.",Sequence,il selectively induces vascular cell adhesion molecule expression human endothelial cell previous study human umbilical vein endothelial cell huvec shown cytokine il induces adherence human eosinophil neutrophil ability selectively induce surface expression vascular cell adhesion molecule vcam cytokine il share number biologic property il examined effect il expression function adhesion molecule huvec incubation huvec il uml induced surface expression vcam detected indirect immunofluorescence flow cytometry without significantly affecting expression eselectin intercellular adhesion molecule kinetics maximal ilinduced expression vcam similar seen il treatment huvec optimal concentration il uml induced adhesiveness eosinophil neutrophil adhesion completely inhibited mab recognizing vcam alpha integrin cdd result demonstrate il like il selectively stimulates huvec express functional cell surface vcam suggest possible role il promoting vcamalpha integrindependent accumulation eosinophil allergic inflammatory reaction vivo
7528696,"CD45RO expression on circulating CD19+ B cells in Crohn's disease correlates with intestinal permeability. Increased intestinal permeability is observed in Crohn's disease and a subset of first-degree relatives. An alteration in isoform expression of the common leukocyte antigen (CD45) is also found in a significant fraction of patients. Because this alteration may be a measure of antigen exposure, the hypothesis of the study was that this alteration would be observed in both patients and relatives of patients with Crohn's disease and that this would correlate with increased intestinal permeability. Lactulose and mannitol permeability were defined in healthy controls, patients with Crohn's disease, and their first-degree relatives. Simultaneously, peripheral blood was assayed using flow cytometry for CD45RO expression on CD19+ B cells. A subset of relatives had significantly increased permeability, as did the majority of patients with Crohn's disease. A small fraction of peripheral B cells from controls expressed the CD45 isoform (< 6%). This fraction was significantly increased for patients with Crohn's disease and their relatives. Relatives with no clinical evidence of Crohn's disease were only found to have increased CD45RO expression if they had increased permeability. Individuals at risk for developing Crohn's disease include a subset with increased intestinal permeability.

7528660,"Predictive value of pathological features for progression after radical prostatectomy. 10-30% of patients with T1/T2 prostate cancer submitted to radical prostatectomy ultimately fail. It may be important to detect failure as early as possible in order to evaluate the extent of recurrent/residual disease and initiate adjuvant therapy. 100 consecutive patients with localized prostate cancer treated by radical prostatectomy have been monitored using the hypersensitive Pros-check prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assay (detection level 0.1 ng/ml). The predictive value of positive surgical margins, involvement of seminal vesicles and perineural spaces as well as Gleason's score for biological failure (persistent or recurrent detectable PSA) has been retrospectively evaluated. Overall 40% of the patients had biological failure (defined as persistence of a detectable or rising PSA after undetectability) and 38% had positive surgical margins. The three main predictive criteria of biological failure were capsular perforation, involvement of seminal vesicles and/or positive margins. All patients in whom these criteria were positive progressed. Seminal vesicle invasion was associated with biological failure in 95% of the cases. 66.7% of the patients with extracapsular disease but no seminal vesicle invasion progressed. 15% of pT2 patients experienced a persistent/recurrent postoperative PSA and were upstaged to pT3 after reevaluation of the specimen.

7518426,"The N terminus of interleukin-8 (IL-8) receptor confers high affinity binding to human IL-8. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a potent inflammatory mediator that belongs to the family of C-X-C chemokines. IL-8 promotes the activation and the extravasation of circulating neutrophils to the site of inflammation. Two IL-8 receptor isotypes (type A and B) are identified in human and rabbit neutrophils. IL-8 receptors belongs to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. Both receptor subtypes A and B bind with high affinity to human IL-8, but they exhibit distinct binding affinity to two functional and structurally related IL-8 peptides, melanoma growth-stimulating activity peptide (MGSA) and neutrophil-activating peptide-2 (NAP-2). Human IL-8 receptor A binds with low affinity to MGSA or NAP-2. In contrast, human IL-8 receptor B binds MGSA with high affinity, and NAP-2 with lesser affinity. Using receptor subtype chimeras, we determined that the N-terminal domain of the receptor confers ligand binding specificity (LaRosa, G. J., Thomas, K. M., Kaufmann, M. E., Mark, R., White, M., Taylor, L., Gray, G., Witt, D., and Navarro, J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 25402-25406). In this work, we characterized by molecular cloning and expression a mouse receptor structurally homologous to the IL-8 receptor. We isolated a clone by screening a mouse genomic library with a rabbit IL-8 receptor A cDNA fragment as a probe. The mouse clone exhibited an open reading frame encoding a 359-amino acid protein. Hydropathy plot analysis of the amino acid sequence reveals seven transmembrane domains characteristic of G-protein-coupled receptors. The N terminus and the second extracellular loop contain one and two putative N-glycosylation sites, respectively. The intracellular C-terminal tail contains Ser and Thr residues as potential phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis showed that the mouse receptor gene is expressed in mouse neutrophils. The mouse receptor shows 65, 74, 66, and 70% amino acid identity to the rabbit IL-8 receptor subtypes A and B and human IL-8 receptor subtypes A and B, respectively. However, neither mouse neutrophils nor CHO cells expressing the mouse receptor bind human IL-8 in the nanomolar range.

The X-linked immunodeficiency Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a condition that includes a deficient anti-polysaccharide Ab response. Recently, it has been suggested that B cells from patients with WAS show a defective calcium mobilization response upon engagement of sIgM. Because primarily EBV-transformed cells were used in these studies, we tested freshly isolated blood B cells for their calcium mobilization capability upon engagement of sIg and CD19. No significant differences in the calcium mobilization capability of CD20+ B cells of four individual WAS patients compared with capability in normal controls were found. Receptor desensitization as assessed by calcium mobilization inhibition also seemed to be intact. T cells were tested for their anti-CD3-induced calcium flux and, again, no abnormalities could be observed when compared with T cells from healthy individuals. We conclude that WAS B and T cells can be stimulated into a normal calcium mobilization response when their AgRs are cross-linked.

The myelin basic protein (MBP)-like material (MBPLM) in human urine is expressed in a cryptic epitope(s) present in MBP peptide 80-89 and absent or inaccessible in intact MBP. These features of urinary MBPLM have made it difficult to produce reagents for its further characterization. Using an immunogen of keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugated to MBP peptide cys 74-89, polyclonal antiserum to urinary MBPLM was prepared. With the same immunogen and screening with urine, the product from one of over 1600 wells from the original fusion, produced monoclonal antibody (mAb) which could detect urinary MBPLM. By radioimmunoassay two rabbit polyclonal reagents recognized a cryptic epitope in MBP peptide 84-89 while the two mAbs recognized another cryptic epitope in MBP peptide 80-85. Both could be used for quantitation of MBPLM in urine. These and previous results indicate the presence of at least three epitopes, one noncryptic and two cryptic, in the decapeptide of MBP 80-89.

Each volunteer received either 500 mL of hydroxyethyl starch (6% wt/vol, average molecular weight 200 kilodaltons, molar substitution 0.5 [ratio hydroxyethyl groups/glucose units] in 0.9% sodium chloride; average molecular weight of 200 kilodaltons) or a control of 500 mL of human albumin (5% albumin solution). After a washout period of 4 wks, subjects crossed over to the alternate treatment. Blood samples were taken immediately before infusion and 20, 45, 75, 105, 165, 285, 405, and 1485 mins after the infusion started. Hematocrit, the blood coagulation parameters fibrinogen, activated partial thromboplastin time, factor VIII:C, thrombin-antithrombin III complexes, and the fibrinolytic parameters fibrin-split product D-Dimer, tissue type plasminogen activator, urokinase plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor, and plasmin-antiplasmin complexes were measured. Except for factor VIII:C levels, which were significantly lower in the hydroxyethyl starch group, no other significant differences in the plasma levels of the parameters mentioned were detected between hydroxyethyl starch and albumin infusions. In one volunteer, who had a low initial factor VIII:C level of 51%, a decrease to 28% at 165 mins during hydroxyethyl starch infusion was found (corresponding albumin value at 165 mins was 41%). a) Medium molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch has a specific lowering effect on factor VIII:C concentrations; this phenomenon may be hazardous to patients who need full hemostatic competence and who receive medium molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch (e.g., as a plasma expander). b) Medium molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch does not specifically influence the activity of the fibrinolytic system.",Sequence,effect hydroxyethyl starch activity blood coagulation fibrinolysis healthy volunteer comparison albumin aim study investigate whether hydroxyethyl starch medium molecular weight dalton compared albumin specific effect blood coagulation fibrinolysis prospective randomized doubleblind crossover trial laboratory university hospital ten healthy male volunteer yr old history hypersensitivity normal physical examination free bleeding disorder patient ingest medication wks study period volunteer received either ml hydroxyethyl starch wtvol average molecular weight kilodaltons molar substitution ratio hydroxyethyl groupsglucose unit sodium chloride average molecular weight kilodaltons control ml human albumin albumin solution washout period wks subject crossed alternate treatment blood sample taken immediately infusion min infusion started hematocrit blood coagulation parameter fibrinogen activated partial thromboplastin time factor viiic thrombinantithrombin iii complex fibrinolytic parameter fibrinsplit product ddimer tissue type plasminogen activator urokinase plasminogen activator plasminogen activator inhibitor plasminantiplasmin complex measured except factor viiic level significantly lower hydroxyethyl starch group significant difference plasma level parameter mentioned detected hydroxyethyl starch albumin infusion one volunteer low initial factor viiic level decrease min hydroxyethyl starch infusion found corresponding albumin value min medium molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch specific lowering effect factor viiic concentration phenomenon may hazardous patient need full hemostatic competence receive medium molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch eg plasma expander medium molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch specifically influence activity fibrinolytic system
7511342,"Glutathione protects signal transduction in type II cells under oxidant stress. Brief exposure of type II cells to 100 microM t-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH) inhibits agonist-induced surfactant secretion and second messenger generation presumably through the oxidation of membrane lipids. Since glutathione (GSH) reduces lipid peroxides and protects type II cells from oxidant injury as determined by crude indicators, then GSH should also protect signal transduction. In the current study, tBOOH inhibited ATP-induced adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and inositol trisphosphate generation and surfactant secretion. Stimulation of surfactant secretion by forskolin or phorbol acetate was also inhibited by tBOOH. Pretreatment with GSH (1 mM) blocked the tBOOH inhibition. This protection occurred in the presence of gamma-glutamyl transferase and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase inhibitors and suggested GSH was transported as an intact molecule. GSH protection was blocked by gamma-L-glutamyl-L-glutamate, an agent that blocks GSH transport. Protection of surfactant secretion and signal transduction was also provided by the constitutive amino acids but not if GSH synthesis was blocked.

In this report we describe four cases of acute megakaryocytic leukemia demonstrated by the presence of megakaryocyte-platelet-related cell-surface antigens. These were detected utilizing flow cytometry and monoclonal antibodies in addition to both platelet peroxidase activity, which was shown by ultrastractural cytochemistry, and emergence of differentiation antigens, while culturing these leukemic cells. The blasts of one patient possessed both platelet GpIb and GpIIb/IIIa cell-surface antigens detected by AN51(CD42b), J15, P2, and HPL2(CD41), respectively, whereas the remaining three patients almost completely lacked GpIb cell-surface antigen. Hence the former were diagnosed as immature(pro)megakaryocytic leukemia and the latter as acute megakaryoblastic leukemia from the viewpoint of immunophenotypic analysis. While we cultured these leukemic cells in conditioned medium prepared from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated leukocytes and interleukin 3, expression of CD36(OKM5) antigen (thrombospondin receptor) increased gradually according to the differentiation and maturation of these cells.

7508979,"Temperature dependence of embryonic cardiac gap junction conductance and channel kinetics. We have investigated the effects of temperature on the conductance and voltage-dependent kinetics of cardiac gap junction channels between pairs of seven-day embryonic chick ventricle myocytes over the range of 14-26 degrees C. Records of junctional conductance (Gj) and steady-state unit junctional channel activity were made using the whole-cell double patch-clamp technique while the bath temperature was steadily changed at a rate of about 4 degrees C/min. The decrease in Gj upon cooling was biphasic with a distinct break at 21 degrees C. In 12 cell pairs, Q10 was 2.2 from 26 to 21 degrees C, while between 21 and 14 degrees C it was 6.5. The mean Gj at 22 degrees C (Gj22) was 3.0 +/- 2.1 nS, ranging in different preparations from 0.24 to 6.4 nS. At room temperature, embryonic cardiac gap junctions contain channels with conductance states near 240, 200, 160, 120, 80 and 40 pS. In the present study, we demonstrate that cooling decreases the frequency of channel openings at all conductance levels, and at temperatures below 20 degrees C shifts the prevalence of openings from higher to lower conductance states: all 240 pS openings disappear below 20 degrees C; 200 pS openings are suppressed at 17 degrees C; below 16 degrees C 160 and 120 pS events disappear and only 80 and 40 pS states are seen. Temperature also affected the voltage-dependent kinetics of the channels. Application of a 6 sec, 80 mV voltage step across the junction (Vj80) caused a biexponential decay in junctional conductance. Decay was faster at lower temperatures, whereas the rate of recovery of Gj after returning to Vj0 was slowed. Cooling reduced the fast decay time constant, increased both recovery time constants, and decreased the magnitude of Gj decay, thus leaving a 10-16% larger residual conductance (Gss/Ginit, +/- 80 mV Vj) at 18 than at 22 degrees C. From these results we propose that embryonic chick cardiac gap junctions contain at least two classes of channels with different conductances and temperature sensitivities.",Sequence,temperature dependence embryonic cardiac gap junction conductance channel kinetics investigated effect temperature conductance voltagedependent kinetics cardiac gap junction channel pair sevenday embryonic chick ventricle myocytes range degree record junctional conductance gj steadystate unit junctional channel activity made using wholecell double patchclamp technique bath temperature steadily changed rate degree cmin decrease gj upon cooling biphasic distinct break degree cell pair degree degree mean gj degree gj n ranging different preparation n room temperature embryonic cardiac gap junction contain channel conductance state near p present study demonstrate cooling decrease frequency channel opening conductance level temperature degree shift prevalence opening higher lower conductance state p opening disappear degree p opening suppressed degree degree p event disappear p state seen temperature also affected voltagedependent kinetics channel application sec mv voltage step across junction vj caused biexponential decay junctional conductance decay faster lower temperature whereas rate recovery gj returning vj slowed cooling reduced fast decay time constant increased recovery time constant decreased magnitude gj decay thus leaving larger residual conductance gssginit mv vj degree result propose embryonic chick cardiac gap junction contain least two class channel different conductance temperature sensitivity
7508854,"Contrast modulated steady-state visual evoked potentials (CMSS VEPs): recording evoked potentials and related single cell responses in area 17 of the cat. (1) The functional characteristics of the neuronal substrate, responding to the CMSS VEP stimulus, were studied by recording CMSS VEPs and related single unit activity in area 17 of the anaesthetised and paralysed cat. CMSS VEPs use an 8 Hz phase reversing (i.e., 16 reversals/sec) grating stimulus with rapid contrast sweeping and allow the contrast thresholds and lag values to be measured as a function of the spatial frequency. (2) The CMSS VEPs of the anaesthetised cat have a wave form similar to those of humans but are shifted to lower spatial frequencies, higher contrast thresholds and longer lag values. (3) The cellular response to a sinusoidal grating, phase reversing at 8 Hz, was studied in order to identify the neuronal substrate generating the CMSS VEPs. Sixty percent of the area 17 cells respond to this stimulus. Cells responding at 8 Hz reversal comprise a distinct subpopulation of visual cortical cells selective for higher velocities and lower spatial frequencies. (4) Although the CMSS VEPs contain almost exclusively energy at 16 Hz, the temporal response pattern of striate cells is quite disparate, including first and second harmonic response patterns as well as an intermediate type. (5) There is a near-perfect correlation between the contrast thresholds of single cells, obtained with the contrast swept stimulus and those obtained with a static contrast test, validating the technique of rapid linear contrast sweeping. (6) The influence of the temporal parameters of the contrast sweeping on the calculated contrast threshold was investigated at the neuronal level. These parameters only marginally influence the responses. (7) CMSS VEP contrast thresholds and neuronal thresholds were compared. The sensitivity of VEPs corresponds to that of the most sensitive neuronal generators.

Although dextran-Mg2+ precipitation produces accurate and precise results for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in fresh plasma and serum, precipitation of frozen specimens with triglycerides > 2.26 mmol/L (> 200 mg/dL) is difficult. We developed a modification that dilutes thawed samples by 35% and increases dextran-Mg2+ reagent to 15% of sample volume. Standard precipitations were performed on 62 fresh EDTA-treated plasma specimens; supernatant solutions were analyzed fresh and after freezing. Standard and modified methods were also performed on thawed, paired plasmas. In specimens with triglycerides < or = 2.26 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol results for all methods were similar. For triglycerides > 2.26 mmol/L, however, bias and precision were significantly affected by freezing, and 38.5% of samples with standard precipitation required additional procedures to produce clear supernatant solutions.

The structure of unliganded HIV-1 reverse transcriptase has been determined at 2.35 A resolution and refined to an R-factor of 0.219 (for all data) with good stereochemistry. The unliganded structure was produced by soaking out a weak binding non-nucleoside inhibitor, HEPT, from pregrown crystals. Comparison with the structures of four different RT and non-nucleoside inhibitor complexes reveals that only minor domain rearrangements occur, but there is a significant repositioning of a three-stranded beta-sheet in the p66 subunit (containing the catalytic aspartic acid residues 110, 185 and 186) with respect to the rest of the polymerase site.

7540911,"The raccoon spinocervical and spinothalamic tracts: a horseradish peroxidase study. The locations of the cells of origin of the spinocervical tract (SCT) and spinothalamic tract (STT) were examined in relation to the somatotopic and laminar organization of the cervical enlargement of the raccoon dorsal horn (DH). In different animals, either the lateral cervical nucleus or the lateral thalamus was injected with a 2% solution of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP). Following 24 h or 4 days, respectively, the animals were sacrificed and both injection and target sites (spinal cord segments C6-T2) were processed using the TMB method. All labelled cells were counted in every fifth 50 microns section. Following injection of WGA-HRP into the lateral cervical nucleus, all labelled SCT cells were located ipsilateral to the injection sites. Most (84%) were in laminae III and IV, laminae known from other studies to contain cells preferentially responsive to light tactile stimulation, with very few (3%) in lamina I. Nearly 50% of labelled cells were located in the medial 1/3 of the DH, the region of representation of the glabrous surfaces of the raccoon forepaw. The mean number of labelled SCT cells per section was 4.19. After tracer injections of the lateral thalamus, more than 75% of STT cells were located contralateral to the injection sites. Forty-three percent were located in lamina I and 24% were in lamina V, laminae whose cells have been shown to be responsive to more intense forms of stimulation, as well as to light touch. Only 22% were located in the medial 1/3 of the DH. The mean number of labelled STT cells per section was 0.83.

7540244,"Catabolite repression in Bacillus subtilis: a global regulatory mechanism for the gram-positive bacteria?. Three components involved in catabolite repression (CR) of gene expression in Bacillus have been identified. The cis-acting catabolite responsive element (CRE), which is present in many genes encoding carbon catabolic enzymes in various species of the Gram-positive bacteria, mediates CR of several genes in Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, and Staphylococcus xylosus. CR of most genes regulated via CRE is also affected by the trans-acting factors CcpA and HPr. Similarities between CcpA and Lac and Gal repressors suggest binding of CcpA to CRE. HPr, a component of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system, undergoes regulatory phosphorylation at a serine residue by a fructose-1,6-diphosphate-activated kinase. A mutant of HPr, which is not phosphorylatable at this position because of an exchange of serine to alanine, lacks CR of several catabolic activities. This mutant phenotype is similar to the one exhibited by a ccpA mutant. Direct protein-protein interaction between CcpA and HPr(Ser-P) was recently demonstrated and constitutes a link between metabolic activity and CR.",Sequence,catabolite repression bacillus subtilis global regulatory mechanism grampositive bacteria three component involved catabolite repression cr gene expression bacillus identified cisacting catabolite responsive element cre present many gene encoding carbon catabolic enzyme various specie grampositive bacteria mediates cr several gene bacillus subtilis bacillus megaterium staphylococcus xylosus cr gene regulated via cre also affected transacting factor ccpa hpr similarity ccpa lac gal repressor suggest binding ccpa cre hpr component phosphoenolpyruvatesugar phosphotransferase system undergoes regulatory phosphorylation serine residue fructosediphosphateactivated kinase mutant hpr phosphorylatable position exchange serine alanine lack cr several catabolic activity mutant phenotype similar one exhibited ccpa mutant direct proteinprotein interaction ccpa hprserp recently demonstrated constitutes link metabolic activity cr

The plasma concentration values for C-reactive protein were not elevated at all in the material. The increase of plasma levels of acute phase proteins could be the result of persistent inflammatory stimuli that occur in primary chronic glomerulonephritides.

7540163,"Conformational study of a synthetic analogue of alamethicin. Influence of the conformation on ion-channel lifetimes. Alamethicin, a 20-residue peptaibol, induces voltage-dependent ion channels in lipid bilayers according to the barrel-stave model. A synthetic analogue (L2) in which all Aib were replaced by Leu shows a conductance behaviour similar to alamethicin, but channel lifetimes are drastically reduced. Among several hypotheses, a different conformation for L2 might be responsible for this phenomenon by increasing the alpha-helical content (alamethicin presents some 3.0(10)-helical parts) and thus decreasing the length of the transmembrane part. A conformational study of L2 was undertaken using FTIR, CD and NMR spectroscopy, and the secondary structure was compared with alamethicin. These techniques showed an enhanced predominant helical structure as compared to alamethicin. Moreover, the NOE pattern showed an exclusively alpha-helical conformation, resulting in a smaller length of the L2 peptide. This shortening somewhat impedes the complete crossing of the membrane, and could then explain the reduction of its ion-channel lifetimes.",Transfection,conformational study synthetic analogue alamethicin influence conformation ionchannel lifetime alamethicin residue peptaibol induces voltagedependent ion channel lipid bilayers according barrelstave model synthetic analogue aib replaced leu show conductance behaviour similar alamethicin channel lifetime drastically reduced among several hypothesis different conformation might responsible phenomenon increasing alphahelical content alamethicin present helical part thus decreasing length transmembrane part conformational study undertaken using ftir cd nmr spectroscopy secondary structure compared alamethicin technique showed enhanced predominant helical structure compared alamethicin moreover noe pattern showed exclusively alphahelical conformation resulting smaller length peptide shortening somewhat impedes complete crossing membrane explain reduction ionchannel lifetime

Effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on the L-type Ca2+ channels were examined in rabbit isolated ventricular cells by use of whole-cell and cell-attached configurations of the patch clamp methods. ANP produced a concentration-dependent decrease (10-100 nM) in amplitude of a basal Ca2+ channel current. 2. The inactive ANP (methionine-oxidized ANP, 30 nM) failed to decrease the current. 3. 8-Bromo-cyclic GMP (300 microM), a potent activator of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), produced the same effects on the basal Ca2+ channel current as those produced by ANP. The cyclic GMP-induced inhibition of the Ca2+ channel current was still evoked in the presence of 1-isobutyl-3-methyl-xanthine, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. ANP failed to produce inhibition of the Ca2+ channel current in the presence of 8-bromo-cyclic GMP. 4.

7538977,"Alpha v-integrins in human melanoma: gain of alpha v beta 3 and loss of alpha v beta 5 are related to tumor progression in situ but not to metastatic capacity of cell lines in nude mice. We investigated the expression of alpha v-integrins in different stages of human cutaneous melanocytic tumor progression. We observed that alpha v beta 5 was the alpha v-integrin expressed in all common nevocellular nevi, in 78% of dysplastic nevi, in 63% of early primary melanomas, in 43% of advanced primary melanomas, and in 33% of melanoma metastases. Hence, loss of alpha v beta 5 expression was related to melanocytic tumor progression. In line with earlier reports, alpha v beta 3 was exclusively detected in advanced primary melanomas and metastases (24% and 50% respectively). Staining with anti-alpha v monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) in lesions where both alpha v beta 3 and alpha v beta 5 were absent showed that alternative alpha v-integrins were expressed in advanced primary melanomas and metastases. By FACS analysis, we determined expression of alpha v beta 5 and alpha v beta 3 in 4 human melanoma cell lines with different metastatic capacities after s.c. inoculation into nude mice. One of the non-metastatic and both highly metastatic cell lines expressed alpha v beta 5 at their surface. Surprisingly, alpha v beta 3 was detected exclusively in the non-metastatic cell lines. Absence of alpha v beta 3 in the highly metastatic cell lines was confirmed by lack of immunoprecipitation from 35S-methionine-labeled cells and by absence of immunohistochemical staining on primary and metastatic xenograft lesions. Our findings indicate that alpha v beta 5 expression is often lost in advanced stages of melanocytic tumor progression in situ, while alpha v beta 3 is acquired, but that a decrease in alpha v beta 5 and an increase in alpha v beta 3 expression are not necessarily related to the metastatic behavior of human melanoma cells in nude mice.",Transfection,alpha vintegrins human melanoma gain alpha beta loss alpha beta related tumor progression situ metastatic capacity cell line nude mouse investigated expression alpha vintegrins different stage human cutaneous melanocytic tumor progression observed alpha beta alpha vintegrin expressed common nevocellular nevus dysplastic nevus early primary melanoma advanced primary melanoma melanoma metastasis hence loss alpha beta expression related melanocytic tumor progression line earlier report alpha beta exclusively detected advanced primary melanoma metastasis respectively staining antialpha monoclonal antibody mabs lesion alpha beta alpha beta absent showed alternative alpha vintegrins expressed advanced primary melanoma metastasis facs analysis determined expression alpha beta alpha beta human melanoma cell line different metastatic capacity sc inoculation nude mouse one nonmetastatic highly metastatic cell line expressed alpha beta surface surprisingly alpha beta detected exclusively nonmetastatic cell line absence alpha beta highly metastatic cell line confirmed lack immunoprecipitation smethioninelabeled cell absence immunohistochemical staining primary metastatic xenograft lesion finding indicate alpha beta expression often lost advanced stage melanocytic tumor progression situ alpha beta acquired decrease alpha beta increase alpha beta expression necessarily related metastatic behavior human melanoma cell nude mouse

We show here that the human factor-dependent cell line M07e is responsive to the cell cycle-suppressive effects of MIP-1 alpha, has specific membrane-binding sites for MIP-1 alpha, and that treatment of these cells with this chemokine increases the phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphocholine turnover rates in cells that are synergistically stimulated by the combination of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and steel factor but not these factors acting singly. Additional, MIP-1 alpha treatment induces a dose- and time-dependent increase in intracellular cAMP levels in M07e cells. Both exogenous PC and dibutyryl cAMP were found to suppress the proliferation of M07e colony-forming cells to a level similar to that of MIP-1 alpha, further implicating cAMP and PC metabolism in MIP-1 alpha-induced M07e suppression. RANTES, a related chemokine, with weak or incomplete binding to the cloned MIP-1 alpha receptor, did not suppress M07e colony-forming cells, nor did it increase intracellular cAMP levels, but it did enhance growth factor-induced PC turnover, further supporting the involvement of cAMP in MIP-1 alpha suppression while demonstrating that increased PC turnover alone is not sufficient for suppression. These findings support the idea that the human MIP-1 alpha receptor is coupled to phospholipid and cAMP metabolism in a manner similar to other 7-transmembrane, G-protein-linked receptors and suggest that a phosphatidylcholine hydrolytic cycle and an associated increase in cAMP are part of the mechanisms of action of MIP-1 alpha.",Transfection,macrophage inflammatory protein alpha enhances growth factorstimulated phosphatidylcholine metabolism increase camp level human growth factordependent cell line event associated growth suppression immunoregulatory cc chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein alpha mip alpha suppressive activity proliferation stem cell early subset myeloid progenitor cell receptor cc chemokines bind mip alpha characterized cloned shown related structurally neuropeptide receptor couple gproteins phospholipasec adenyl cyclase yet little information intracellular mechanism action mip alpha available show human factordependent cell line responsive cell cyclesuppressive effect mip alpha specific membranebinding site mip alpha treatment cell chemokine increase phosphatidylcholine pc phosphocholine turnover rate cell synergistically stimulated combination granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor steel factor factor acting singly additional mip alpha treatment induces dose timedependent increase intracellular camp level cell exogenous pc dibutyryl camp found suppress proliferation colonyforming cell level similar mip alpha implicating camp pc metabolism mip alphainduced suppression rantes related chemokine weak incomplete binding cloned mip alpha receptor suppress colonyforming cell increase intracellular camp level enhance growth factorinduced pc turnover supporting involvement camp mip alpha suppression demonstrating increased pc turnover alone sufficient suppression finding support idea human mip alpha receptor coupled phospholipid camp metabolism manner similar transmembrane gproteinlinked receptor suggest phosphatidylcholine hydrolytic cycle associated increase camp part mechanism action mip alpha
7511492,"Effect of local inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis on forearm blood flow and dorsal hand vein size in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. 1. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent endogenous vasodilator and plays a role in the control of resting vascular tone. Patients with cirrhosis have a hyperdynamic circulation with reduced blood pressure and decreased peripheral resistance, and it is possible that increased production of NO due to induction of NO synthase may be involved in maintaining this vasodilatation. We have examined this possibility by studying the effects of local infusions of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (an inhibitor of NO synthase) in the forearm arteriolar bed and the superficial dorsal hand veins of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. 2. Drugs were either infused locally into the brachial artery and forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography, or into a vein on the back of the hand and vein diameter was measured using a linear displacement technique. 3. Basal forearm blood flow was increased and vascular resistance was decreased in the patients with alcoholic cirrhosis compared with healthy control subjects. Noradrenaline and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine caused dose-dependent falls in forearm blood flow in both healthy control subjects and patients with cirrhosis. There was no significant difference in the responses to either noradrenaline or NG-monomethyl-L-arginine between the two groups. 4. In the superficial hand veins there was no change in vein size in response to NG-monomethyl-L-arginine infused alone, and venoconstriction to local infusion of noradrenaline was unaffected by co-infusion with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. 5.

7540625,"Simplified PCR for detection of Haemophilus ducreyi and diagnosis of chancroid. A simplified PCR was developed for detection of Haemophilus ducreyi in samples from chancroid patients. The strategy included a straightforward chloroform extraction sample preparation method, a one-tube nested PCR to minimize contamination risks, and a colorimetric method for detection of products. Primers were designed from published nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA gene of H. ducreyi, with longer outer primers for annealing at a higher temperature and shorter inner primers labelled with biotin and digoxigenin for binding with avidin and colorimetric detection. The PCR technique detected all 35 strains of H. ducreyi tested, from four different geographical regions, and was negative for other, related strains of bacteria and for the common contaminating bacteria tested. Of 25 samples from H. ducreyi culture-positive chancroid patients, 24 were PCR positive and 1 produced a weak reaction. Of 83 samples from clinical cases of chancroid in the Republic of South Africa, 69 were PCR positive. The sensitivity of PCR compared with that of clinical diagnosis was 83%. All 50 negative control samples were negative. Encouraging results were also obtained with a consecutive series of 25 genital ulcer patients in Tanzania, of whom 9 were PCR positive. The adaptations of this simplified PCR strategy, at the sensitivity and specificity levels obtained, mean it will be useful for detection of H. ducreyi in areas where the organism is endemic, particularly where testing by culture is difficult or impossible.",Transfection,simplified pcr detection haemophilus ducreyi diagnosis chancroid simplified pcr developed detection haemophilus ducreyi sample chancroid patient strategy included straightforward chloroform extraction sample preparation method onetube nested pcr minimize contamination risk colorimetric method detection product primer designed published nucleotide sequence rrna gene ducreyi longer outer primer annealing higher temperature shorter inner primer labelled biotin digoxigenin binding avidin colorimetric detection pcr technique detected strain ducreyi tested four different geographical region negative related strain bacteria common contaminating bacteria tested sample ducreyi culturepositive chancroid patient pcr positive produced weak reaction sample clinical case chancroid republic south africa pcr positive sensitivity pcr compared clinical diagnosis negative control sample negative encouraging result also obtained consecutive series genital ulcer patient tanzania pcr positive adaptation simplified pcr strategy sensitivity specificity level obtained mean useful detection ducreyi area organism endemic particularly testing culture difficult impossible
7538598,"Prostate specific antigen density is not an independent predictor of response for prostate cancer treated by conformal radiotherapy. Although prostate specific antigen (PSA) density appears to be an important discriminator between benign and malignant prostatic disease, conflicting data exist concerning its prognostic value. The present study was undertaken to confirm whether PSA density represents a new prognostic indicator of disease-free survival for prostate cancer treated with conformal radio-therapy. Between April 1989 and December 1992, 186 patients with organ confined prostate cancer were treated with definitive irradiation according to previously published conformal guidelines. The PSA density was defined as the ratio of the pretreatment serum PSA (ng./ml.) to the prostate volume (ml.) as determined from treatment planning computerized tomography. The median PSA density was 0.15 with a range of 0.02 to 2.12. A statistically significant advantage in actuarial freedom from biochemical relapse was noted for patients with pretreatment PSA levels less than 15 ng./ml. when compared to those with higher pretreatment PSA levels (3-year freedom from biochemical relapse 85% versus 28%, p < 0.001). Also, patients with PSA density of 0.15 or less had statistically superior freedom from biochemical relapse compared to their counterparts with higher PSA density (3-year freedom from biochemical relapse 88% versus 28%, p < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis only the baseline PSA (p < 0.002) and the Gleason score (p < 0.002) emerged as significant predictors of prolonged freedom from biochemical relapse. The PSA density had no impact on freedom from biochemical relapse whether it was entered into this multivariate model as a continuous or a dichotomous variable. In our data base baseline PSA levels remain the most powerful independent discriminant of response to conformal irradiation. PSA density is only a surrogate for baseline PSA levels and does not refine the ability to predict prolongation of freedom from biochemical relapse following conformal radiotherapy.",Transfection,prostate specific antigen density independent predictor response prostate cancer treated conformal radiotherapy although prostate specific antigen psa density appears important discriminator benign malignant prostatic disease conflicting data exist concerning prognostic value present study undertaken confirm whether psa density represents new prognostic indicator diseasefree survival prostate cancer treated conformal radiotherapy april december patient organ confined prostate cancer treated definitive irradiation according previously published conformal guideline psa density defined ratio pretreatment serum psa ngml prostate volume ml determined treatment planning computerized tomography median psa density range statistically significant advantage actuarial freedom biochemical relapse noted patient pretreatment psa level le ngml compared higher pretreatment psa level year freedom biochemical relapse versus also patient psa density le statistically superior freedom biochemical relapse compared counterpart higher psa density year freedom biochemical relapse versus multivariate analysis baseline psa gleason score emerged significant predictor prolonged freedom biochemical relapse psa density impact freedom biochemical relapse whether entered multivariate model continuous dichotomous variable data base baseline psa level remain powerful independent discriminant response conformal irradiation psa density surrogate baseline psa level refine ability predict prolongation freedom biochemical relapse following conformal radiotherapy

This study was undertaken to investigate the possible involvement of K+ channels in PGE1-mediated vasodilatation. The increase in coronary flow elicited by PGE1 in isolated working rat hearts was attenuated by phentolamine and glibenclamide, inhibitors of ATP-regulated K+ channels, whereas apamin and charybdotoxin, inhibitors of calcium-activated K+ channels, were ineffective. In the anaesthetized rat, the duration of the hypotensive action of PGE1 was markedly attenuated by glibenclamide.

7533525,"Delineation of two distinct deleted regions on chromosome 9 in human non-melanoma skin cancers. The mapping of the naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) and the Ferguson-Smith syndrome to the same region on chromosome arm 9q has led to speculation that the two conditions may reflect different mutations within the same gene. Loss of heterozygosity of 9q alleles in both familial and sporadic basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) suggests that the NBCCS gene on 9q is acting as a tumour suppressor gene. Although LOH of 9q markers has not been studied in squamous cell neoplasms from patients with the Ferguson-Smith syndrome, chromosome 9 allele loss has been reported in sporadic squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the skin. In order to characterise further the deleted region on chromosome 9 in BCCs and SCCs of the skin we have examined a series of non-melanoma skin cancers using a panel of highly informative microsatellite markers. Forty-four BCCs and 49 SCCs were studied. Loss of heterozygosity of one or more 9q markers was seen in 33 of the 44 BCCs. Only 4 of the 33 BCCs with 9q loss showed loss of 9p markers. Twenty-two BCCs showed loss of all informative 9q markers. Partial or interstitial 9q deletions were seen in 5 BCCs, and in 3 of these 5 BCCs the breakpoint occurred within the currently defined NBCCS locus. Chromosome 9 loss was seen in 16 of 49 SCCs. In contrast to the low frequency of 9p loss in BCCs, LOH of 9p markers was a common finding in SCCs, occurring in 15 of the 16 SCCs with chromosome 9 loss. In 5 SCCs 9p loss occurred with retention of 9q alleles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Transfection,delineation two distinct deleted region chromosome human nonmelanoma skin cancer mapping naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome nbccs fergusonsmith syndrome region chromosome arm led speculation two condition may reflect different mutation within gene loss heterozygosity allele familial sporadic basal cell carcinoma bccs suggests nbccs gene acting tumour suppressor gene although loh marker studied squamous cell neoplasm patient fergusonsmith syndrome chromosome allele loss reported sporadic squamous cell carcinoma sccs skin order characterise deleted region chromosome bccs sccs skin examined series nonmelanoma skin cancer using panel highly informative microsatellite marker fortyfour bccs sccs studied loss heterozygosity one marker seen bccs bccs loss showed loss marker twentytwo bccs showed loss informative marker partial interstitial deletion seen bccs bccs breakpoint occurred within currently defined nbccs locus chromosome loss seen sccs contrast low frequency loss bccs loh marker common finding sccs occurring sccs chromosome loss sccs loss occurred retention allelesabstract truncated word

To compare the outcome of patients with T3a and T3c adenocarcinoma of the prostate and determine the utility of these substages as defined in the current American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Union Against Cancer (AJCC/UICC) staging system. An analysis was performed of patients with T3 (clinical) prostate cancer treated with definitive irradiation at the Fox Chase Cancer Center between 1986 and 1993. The series was composed of 66 patients with T3a tumors and 44 patients with T3c tumors. The endpoints studied included freedom from biochemical relapse (bNED) and rates of clinical local and distant failure. No statistically significant differences in freedom from biochemical relapse were observed when comparing patients with T3a and T3c disease (3 years bNED, 41%; difference not significant). Similarly, there was no difference in the patterns of clinical failure at 3 years when comparing patients with T3a and T3c disease (21% clinically detected distant metastases; < 10% local failure in either group). In a multivariate analysis, only a low baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (eg, 20 ng/mL or less) independently predicted the likelihood of remaining biochemically free of disease.

7533445,"Serum TPS, PSA, and PAP values in relapsing stage D2 adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Serum tissue polypeptide-specific antigen (TPS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) concentrations were serially measured in 31 prostate cancer patients with bone metastases who had relapsed following hormonal therapy. Of these subjects 7 had well-differentiated cancer (G1), 13 patients were assessed to have moderately differentiated tumor (G2) while in 11 subjects poorly differentiated tumor (C13) was found. With increasing tumor grade (G1 to G3), a proportional increase in mean TPS value was found while the increase in respective PAP serotest values was not linear. Simultaneously measured mean PSA values showed a curved effect. Both PSA and PAP serotest concentrations depend on the respective hormone-dependent gene expressions that gradually decrease with tumor dedifferentiation. Therefore, in progressive hormonally treated stage D2 prostate cancer patients an androgen-independent TPS serotest seems to be a useful clinical addition for monitoring protocols. The combined use of TPS, PSA, and PAP seems to give a better reflection of tumor status. According to the bone scan data metastatic tumor mass in G3 carcinomas was virtually equal to cancer burden in G2 tumors. Hence, the marked elevation of TPS serotest values in G3 adenocarcinomas could not be attributed to greater tumor mass but was most likely due to an increase in proliferation rate. Some authors have recently proposed cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19 to be the origin of TPS serum findings. However, cytokeratin content has been proven to be lower in G3 tumors than in better-differentiated neoplasms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Transfection,serum tps psa pap value relapsing stage adenocarcinoma prostate serum tissue polypeptidespecific antigen tps prostatespecific antigen psa prostatic acid phosphatase pap concentration serially measured prostate cancer patient bone metastasis relapsed following hormonal therapy subject welldifferentiated cancer patient assessed moderately differentiated tumor subject poorly differentiated tumor found increasing tumor grade proportional increase mean tps value found increase respective pap serotest value linear simultaneously measured mean psa value showed curved effect psa pap serotest concentration depend respective hormonedependent gene expression gradually decrease tumor dedifferentiation therefore progressive hormonally treated stage prostate cancer patient androgenindependent tps serotest seems useful clinical addition monitoring protocol combined use tps psa pap seems give better reflection tumor status according bone scan data metastatic tumor mass carcinoma virtually equal cancer burden tumor hence marked elevation tps serotest value adenocarcinoma attributed greater tumor mass likely due increase proliferation rate author recently proposed cytokeratins origin tps serum finding however cytokeratin content proven lower tumor betterdifferentiated neoplasmsabstract truncated word

7531286,"Intensification and depletion of specific bulky renal DNA adducts (I-compounds) following exposure of male F344 rats to the renal carcinogen ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA). The effects of the renal carcinogen ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA) on kidney DNA of male F344 rats were studied to determine whether bulky DNA oxidation products (putative intrastrand crosslinks) could be detected by 32P-postlabeling in the target organ of carcinogenesis. Rats (10-11 weeks old) were given a single dose of Fe-NTA (15 mg Fe/kg body weight) i.p. at 3:00 pm. After 5 h, renal DNA from Fe-NTA-treated and vehicle control animals was assayed by 32P-postlabeling. Thin-layer chromatography and quantitative analysis of two labeled nucleotide fractions of increasing polarity, L and C, showed that three spots (L1, L2, and C3) were intensified 3.5- to 4.2-fold in treated animals. L1 consisted of subfractions L1a, L1b, and L1c, which could be resolved chromatographically. L1c, L2, and C3 were identical to DNA oxidation products generated by the Fenton reaction in vitro, while L1a and L1b apparently did not arise by this mechanism. DNA damage and toxicity appeared reduced in younger animals and animals treated in the morning, presumably due to differences in antioxidant defenses. Liver and lung (non-target organs) DNA did not exhibit enhanced L1, L2, and C3 spots. In addition to augmenting renal I-compounds, Fe-NTA reduced the levels of three major polar kidney I-compounds (C4, C5, and C6) to 22-53% of control. This reduction did not appear to arise by direct oxidative DNA damage, resembling the previously documented loss of liver I-compounds induced by numerous hepatocarcinogens. Two of these I-compounds (C4 and C5) have been reported to exhibit positive linear correlations with median lifespan of male F344 rats. The pleiotropic response of kidney I-compound levels to Fe-NTA was consistent with different roles of different types (I and II) of I-compounds in Fe-NTA-mediated renal carcinogenesis.

Vaccination of cattle with the recombinant E7 protein of bovine papillomavirus type 4 (BPV-4) prior to BPV-4 infection has been shown to retard development of papillomas and accelerate their regression. To understand the mechanism of regression we have measured proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) to E7 in vitro during the course of BPV-4 infection in both vaccinated and nonvaccinated cattle. In vaccinated cattle, T cells specific for E7 could be detected at high levels shortly after challenge, whereas in nonvaccinated cattle low responses of E7-specific T cells could be detected in only a few animals at the late stages of papilloma development.

The selection of immunological targets present on gametes is an important first step in the successful production of animal or human vaccines for immunocontraception. One strategy with regard to sperm antigens is to select antigens with physiological roles in gamete interaction, obtain the mRNA sequence for such an antigen, and then determine which region or domain of the molecule is available to the immune system when spermatozoa are presented to the female reproductive system. To illustrate this strategy, we have used the rabbit sperm antigen Sp17 (RSA-3), which has been cloned and sequenced. The peptide pin-block method of Chiron Mimotopes, Australia, has been used to analyse the 146 amino acids of Sp17 with various homologous and heterologous antisera.

F165(1)-positive strains (5131 and 5131a) attached to and were ingested by PMNLs at a significantly higher level than afimbrial mutant M48 (P < 0.001) after 1 h of incubation. During incubation of these strains with PMNLs for up to 6 h, parental strain 5131 resisted killing whereas afimbriate mutant M48 and acapsular mutant 5131a were gradually killed and were found at significantly lower numbers than the parental strain 5131 at 2 (P < 0.05) and 6 (P < 0.001) h. When bacteria were opsonized with normal pig serum, the afimbriate and acapsular mutants survived less well than when the bacteria were nonopsonized. Upon examination by electron microscopy of PMNLs after 2 h of incubation with bacteria, structurally normal bacteria were observed more often within phagosomes of PMNLs incubated with the parental strain than within phagosomes of PMNLs incubated with the afimbriate or the acapsular mutant. The extracellular oxidative response (as tested by release of hydrogen peroxide) of PMNLs stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate was completely inhibited by F165(1)-positive strains but only partially inhibited by the afimbriate mutant. These results suggest that the F165(1) fimbrial system may mediate adherence of E. coli O115 to PMNLs. Survival of the parental strain in the presence of PMNLs, which may be intracellular, is at least partially due to the presence of the F165(1) fimbrial system and of the O-antigen capsule K""V165"".

7528776,"Very late activation antigen 4-vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 interaction is involved in the formation of erythroblastic islands. Erythroblastic islands are anatomical units consisting of a central macrophage surrounded by erythroblasts. We studied the adhesion molecules involved in the formation of these structures. Central macrophages of erythroblastic islands isolated from the spleens of phlebotomized mice were clearly stained for vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). The surrounding erythroblasts of the erythroblastic islands strongly expressed the alpha 4 integrin of very late activation antigen 4 (VLA-4: alpha 4 beta 1 integrin), the counter receptor of VCAM-1, whereas most reticulocytes and erythrocytes did not. Both monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against alpha 4 integrin and VCAM-1 disrupted the erythroblastic islands cultured in the presence of erythropoietin. Moreover, adhesion of splenic erythroblasts to tumor necrosis factor alpha-stimulated mouse splenic endothelial cells, which showed high expression of VCAM-1 but not intercellular adhesion molecule 1, was inhibited by the anti-VCAM-1 and anti-alpha 4 mAbs.

Insulin like growth factor (IGF) 1 and 2 which are present and actively synthesised in the wound fluid stimulate several cell types involved in the process of wound healing. To investigate the role of IGF-1 and 2 and in addition, the association between IGF and their carrier proteins, IGF binding proteins (IGFBP), we have used a newly established model for human wound healing in fresh biopsy material. Histological examination shows that IGF-1 stimulates efficient reepithelialisation of the wounds both alone and in the presence of recombinant IGFBP-1. In contrast, IGF-2 stimulates healing only when used in combination with IGFBP-1. These findings suggest that the two IGFs and their carrier proteins may function during different phases of wound healing and that both IGF-1 and 2 act as potent inducers of wound healing; this may have direct clinical implications.",Transfection,insulin like growth factor role reepithelialisation wound interaction insulin like growth factor binding protein type insulin like growth factor igf present actively synthesised wound fluid stimulate several cell type involved process wound healing investigate role igf addition association igf carrier protein igf binding protein igfbp used newly established model human wound healing fresh biopsy material histological examination show igf stimulates efficient reepithelialisation wound alone presence recombinant igfbp contrast igf stimulates healing used combination igfbp finding suggest two igfs carrier protein may function different phase wound healing igf act potent inducer wound healing may direct clinical implication
7521329,"Mutational analysis of the helical hairpin region of diphtheria toxin transmembrane domain. Entry of the catalytic domain of diphtheria toxin into the cytoplasma of eukaryotic cells depends on insertion of the T (transmembrane) domain into the endosomal membrane, a process triggered by low pH. To probe the mechanism of insertion, we mutated ionizable residues within the helical hairpin region of the T domain. Only three mutations caused significant effects on cytotoxicity, D295K, E349K, and D352K. Each of these represents a substitution of a basic for an acidic residue at the tip of a helical hairpin. Substitution of Lys for Glu349 or Asp352, in the TH8/9 hairpin, reduced toxicity for Vero cells > 100-fold, whereas a Lys substitution for Asp295, one of 3 acidic residues in the TH5/6/7 hairpin, caused a less marked reduction. All three mutations also altered the pH-dependent formation, and/or ion conductance, of channels formed by the toxin in artificial bilayers or the plasma membrane. E349K or D352K did not alter the pH dependence of conformational changes in the toxin occurring near pH 5. Our findings support the hypothesis that the TH8/9 hairpin inserts into the endosomal membrane after low pH-mediated partial unfolding of the T domain. A positive residue at the tip of this hairpin apparently inhibits insertion and blocks toxin action. The ion-conducting properties of channels formed by selected mutants, described elsewhere, are consistent with this model. The status of the TH5/6/7 hairpin in the integral membrane form of the T domain remains uncertain.",Transfection,mutational analysis helical hairpin region diphtheria toxin transmembrane domain entry catalytic domain diphtheria toxin cytoplasma eukaryotic cell depends insertion transmembrane domain endosomal membrane process triggered low ph probe mechanism insertion mutated ionizable residue within helical hairpin region domain three mutation caused significant effect cytotoxicity dk ek dk represents substitution basic acidic residue tip helical hairpin substitution lys glu asp th hairpin reduced toxicity vero cell fold whereas lys substitution asp one acidic residue th hairpin caused le marked reduction three mutation also altered phdependent formation andor ion conductance channel formed toxin artificial bilayers plasma membrane ek dk alter ph dependence conformational change toxin occurring near ph finding support hypothesis th hairpin insert endosomal membrane low phmediated partial unfolding domain positive residue tip hairpin apparently inhibits insertion block toxin action ionconducting property channel formed selected mutant described elsewhere consistent model status th hairpin integral membrane form domain remains uncertain

7516708,"The role of posttranscriptional modification in stabilization of transfer RNA from hyperthermophiles. The influence of posttranscriptional modification on structural stabilization of tRNA from hyperthermophilic archaea was studied, using Pyrococcus furiosus (growth optimum 100 degrees C) as a primary model. Optical melting temperatures (Tm) of unfractionated tRNA in 20 mM Mg2+ are 97 degrees C for P. furiosus and 101.5 degrees C for Pyrodictium occultum (growth optimum, 105 degrees C). These values are approximately 20 degrees C higher than predicted solely from G-C content and are attributed primarily to posttranscriptional modification. Twenty-three modified nucleosides were determined in total digests of P. furiosus tRNA by combined HPLC-mass spectrometry. From cells cultured at 70, 85, and 100 degrees C, progressively increased levels of modification were observed within three families of nucleosides, the most highly modified forms of which were N4-acetyl-2'-O-methylcytidine (ac4Cm), N2,N2,2'-O-trimethylguanosine (m2(2)Gm), and 5-methyl-2-thiouridine (m5s2U). Nucleosides ac4Cm and m2(2)Gm, which are unique to the archaeal hyperthermophiles, were shown in earlier NMR studies to exhibit unusually high conformational stabilities that favor the C3'-endo form [Kawai, G., et al. (1991) Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 21, 49-50; (1992) Nucleosides Nucleotides 11, 759-771]. The sequence location of m5s2U was determined by mass spectrometry to be primarily at tRNA position 54, a site of known thermal stabilization in the bacterial thermophile Thermus thermophilus [Horie, N., et al. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 5711-5715].

The oxidation of Co(II) bleomycin A2 by dioxygen leads to two products, HO2-Co(III) bleomycin A2 (form I) and Co(III) bleomycin A2 (form II). 1H NMR chemical shift assignments for protons of both forms have been made by two-dimensional NMR spectral techniques. The chemical shifts of protons throughout forms I and II differ from each other and from apobleomycin A2. NOESY spectra reveal a number of intermediate and long-range 1H-1H couplings within the metal-binding domain, between the metal-binding domain and the peptide linker, which connects it and the DNA-binding region of the molecule, and, in form I, between the DNA- and metal-binding domains. Molecular dynamics calculations were carried out based on the NOESY results and an adjustable square pyramidyl ligand geometry around Co(III) composed of nitrogen atoms of the primary and secondary amine groups, pyridine (N5), and amide and imidazole (N1) of the hydroxyhistidine residue.

7521577,"Vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor is temporally and spatially correlated with ocular angiogenesis in a primate model. Ischemia often precedes neovascularization. In ocular neovascularization, such as occurs in diabetic retinopathy, a diffusible angiogenic factor has been postulated to be produced by ischemic retina and to lead to neovascularization of the retina, optic nerve, or iris. However, no angiogenic factor has been conclusively identified that satisfies this hypothesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor, hereafter referred to as VEGF, is a likely candidate for an ocular angiogenic factor because it is a secreted mitogen, specific for endothelial cells, and is upregulated by hypoxia. We investigated the association of VEGF with the development of experimental iris neovascularization in the cynomolgus monkey. Following the production of retinal ischemia by laser occlusion of all branch retinal veins, VEGF was increased in the aqueous fluid, and the aqueous VEGF levels changed synchronously and proportionally with the severity of iris neovascularization. Northern analysis and in situ hybridization revealed that VEGF messenger RNA is upregulated in the ischemic retina.

7525994,"Comparison of prostate specific antigen concentration versus prostate specific antigen density in the early detection of prostate cancer: receiver operating characteristic curves. We present the results of a prospective multicenter clinical trial of nearly 5,000 men in which prostate specific antigen (PSA) density was compared to the serum PSA concentration alone for early detection of prostate cancer. All men were evaluated with PSA and digital rectal examination. If PSA was elevated (greater than 4 ng./ml., Hybritech Tandem assay) or digital rectal examination was suspicious, transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies were recommended. Prostate volume was estimated by transrectal ultrasound measurements using a prolate ellipse volume calculation and PSA density was calculated by dividing serum PSA concentration by gland volume. Using a PSA density cutoff of 0.15 as recommended in the literature enhanced specificity but at the cost of missing half of the tumors. Of the organ confined neoplasms 47% were detected by a PSA of greater than 4.0 ng./ml. but they were missed by a PSA density of more than 0.15. PSA density may not be predictive for cancer because accurate estimation of transrectal ultrasound volume is difficult (r = 0.61 for estimated transrectal ultrasound volume versus pathological prostate weight). However, a relationship does exist among transrectal ultrasound volume, PSA and positive predictive value for cancer. PSA concentrations of less than 4.0 ng./ml. did not indicate a need for biopsy (positive predictive value 12 to 17%) unless the digital rectal examination findings were suspicious for cancer. A high percentage of patients with a PSA of more than 10 ng./ml. had cancer (30 to 75%), regardless of gland size. Patients with intermediate PSA concentrations (4.1 to 9.9 ng./ml.) and a gland size of 50 cc or less had a 35 to 51% positive predictive value, while those with intermediate PSA concentrations and a large gland (more than 50 cc) had a 15% positive predictive value. We conclude that in men with a PSA level of 4.1 to 9.9 ng./ml., and normal digital rectal examination and transrectal ultrasound findings, the use of a PSA density cutoff of more than 0.15 for biopsy results in half of the tumors being missed. Thus, we recommend that men in this group undergo biopsy based upon serum PSA concentration rather than PSA density.",Transfection,comparison prostate specific antigen concentration versus prostate specific antigen density early detection prostate cancer receiver operating characteristic curve present result prospective multicenter clinical trial nearly men prostate specific antigen psa density compared serum psa concentration alone early detection prostate cancer men evaluated psa digital rectal examination psa elevated greater ngml hybritech tandem assay digital rectal examination suspicious transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy recommended prostate volume estimated transrectal ultrasound measurement using prolate ellipse volume calculation psa density calculated dividing serum psa concentration gland volume using psa density cutoff recommended literature enhanced specificity cost missing half tumor organ confined neoplasm detected psa greater ngml missed psa density psa density may predictive cancer accurate estimation transrectal ultrasound volume difficult estimated transrectal ultrasound volume versus pathological prostate weight however relationship exist among transrectal ultrasound volume psa positive predictive value cancer psa concentration le ngml indicate need biopsy positive predictive value unless digital rectal examination finding suspicious cancer high percentage patient psa ngml cancer regardless gland size patient intermediate psa concentration ngml gland size cc le positive predictive value intermediate psa concentration large gland cc positive predictive value conclude men psa level ngml normal digital rectal examination transrectal ultrasound finding use psa density cutoff biopsy result half tumor missed thus recommend men group undergo biopsy based upon serum psa concentration rather psa density

7519243,"Monoclonal antibodies defining functional sites on the toxin superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B. Four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were produced binding to four nonoverlapping epitopes on the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). The mAbs were tested for their ability to detect SEB bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, to inhibit SEB binding to MHC class II, to inhibit SEB stimulation of T cell hybridomas, to bind to various nonfunctional mutants of SEB, and to capture and present SEB and its mutants to T cells in the absence of MHC class II. We concluded that two mAbs, B344 and B327, bound to epitopes not required for superantigen function, one mAb, 2B33, blocked an MHC interaction site on SEB, and the fourth mAb, B87, blocked the T cell recognition site on SEB. Moreover, two mAbs (B344 and 2B33) were capable of presenting SEB, although much less efficiently than APC, to CD4- but not CD4+ T cell hybridomas.

7507427,"Abnormal EPSPs evoked by magnetic brain stimulation in hand muscle motoneurons of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Using cross-correlation between magnetic brain stimulation and discharges of a motoneuron made active by a slight voluntary contraction, an indirect estimate of the EPSP evoked by magnetic brain stimulation in single hand muscle motoneurons was obtained in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and normal controls. In total, 60 motoneurons of 3 normal subjects and 70 motoneurons of 7 patients with ALS were investigated. All motoneurons of normal subjects responded to the magnetic brain stimulus with a short-latency EPSP with a rise time between 1 and 5 msec. In contrast, only 67% of the motoneurons from ALS patients responded with an EPSP while the remaining 33% exhibited a clear short-latency inhibition in response to the brain stimulus. For those units of ALS patients showing an EPSP, both latency and EPSP amplitude were indistinguishable from those of normal subjects. The EPSP rise time, however, was massively prolonged in some units (up to 18 msec). These results provide a physiological basis for the interpretation of surface EMG responses in patients with ALS.",Transfection,abnormal epsps evoked magnetic brain stimulation hand muscle motoneuron patient amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using crosscorrelation magnetic brain stimulation discharge motoneuron made active slight voluntary contraction indirect estimate epsp evoked magnetic brain stimulation single hand muscle motoneuron obtained patient amyotrophic lateral sclerosis al normal control total motoneuron normal subject motoneuron patient al investigated motoneuron normal subject responded magnetic brain stimulus shortlatency epsp rise time msec contrast motoneuron al patient responded epsp remaining exhibited clear shortlatency inhibition response brain stimulus unit al patient showing epsp latency epsp amplitude indistinguishable normal subject epsp rise time however massively prolonged unit msec result provide physiological basis interpretation surface emg response patient al
7522022,"Hepatitis C virus infection from blood and blood products. The addition of second-generation HCV epitopes in antibody detection assays has increased the sensitivity and specificity of blood donor testing, to prevent post-transfusion hepatitis non-A, non-B (PTH-NANB), later characterized as Hepatitis C. However, it is not clear whether all HCV infectious donors are detected by second-generation anti-HCV testing. Prospective studies on PTH-NANB were left with some unresolved cases. The use of second-generation anti-HCV assays in blood banks presented a problem with a relatively large number of indeterminate reactivities in supplemental assay such as RIBA-2. These indeterminate reactivities may be solved by the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR is more and more used as an extra confirmatory assay to resolve RIBA indeterminate results on blood donors. However, a European study on the proficiency of HCV PCR in different countries revealed that only a minority of the reference laboratories perform this test faultless. Lately, third-generation RIBA was developed, which was originally designed to resolve RIBA-2 indeterminate cases. RIBA-3 was shown to be more sensitive and specific in early HCV infection and blood donors than RIBA-2. Third-generation anti-HCV testing will become standard practice. Some questions, however, remain unanswered. Do we miss any rare HCV infectious donors, of other genotypes, with third-generation assays, based only on the type 1 sequence of HCV?

7519665,"Nitric oxide-mediated inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in cultured astrocytes. The Ca(2+)-independent form of nitric oxide synthase was induced in rat neonatal astrocytes in primary culture by incubation with lipopolysaccharide (1 microgram/ml) plus interferon-gamma (100 U/ml), and the activities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain components were assessed. Incubation for 18 h produced 25% inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase activity. NADH-ubiquinone-1 reductase (complex I) and succinate-cytochrome c reductase (complex II-III) activities were not affected. Prolonged incubation for 36 h gave rise to a 56% reduction of cytochrome c oxidase activity and a 35% reduction in succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity, but NADH-ubiquinone-1 reductase activity was unchanged. Citrate synthase activity was not affected by any of these conditions. The inhibition of the activities of these mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes was prevented by incubation in the presence of the specific nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. The lipopolysaccharide/interferon-gamma treatment of the astrocytes produced an increase in glycolysis and lactate formation.

The levels of recombinant protein expressed varied, some clones expressed enough protein that can be detected in a Coomassie blue-stained gel, whereas other proteins could only be detected by Western blot analyses. A recombinant env protein representing the extracellular domain of the env protein was detected by BIV-infected bovine sera. In addition, a 134 amino acid peptide which may represent a major immunoreactive epitope was identified. This peptide is located at the amino terminus of the transmembrane glycoprotein and was specifically recognized by all BIV-infected calf sera tested.

7509074,"Identification of an ion channel-forming motif in the primary structure of CFTR, the cystic fibrosis chloride channel. Synthetic peptides with sequences representing putative transmembrane (M) segments of CFTR (the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) were used as tools to identify the involvement of such segments in forming the ionic pore of the CFTR Cl- channel. Peptides with sequences corresponding to M2 and M6 form anion-selective channels after reconstitution in lipid bilayers. In contrast, peptides with the sequences of M1, M3, M4, and M5, or peptides of the same amino acid composition as M2 and M6 but with scrambled sequences, do not form channels. Conductive heterooligomers of M2 and M6 exhibit a single channel conductance of 8 pS (in 0.15 M KCl) and a 95% selectivity for anions over cations, properties that emulate both the conductance and the selectivity of the authentic CFTR channel.

The addition of gonadotropin releasing hormone analog (GnRH-a) to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation regimes has been reported to have several advantages, such as reduced cancellation rate, fewer premature luteinizations and increased clinical pregnancy rate. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of pituitary/ovarian suppression, in terms of the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and the duration of GnRH-a administration, on in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome. Retrospectively, 153 IVF cycles with GnRH-a and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) were examined. After a minimum of 10 days of GnRH-a administration, the patients were started on hMG. The correlations were investigated between the fertilization rates, the numbers of retrieved oocytes and transferred embryos, the cancellation rates, the suppressed LH, FSH and estradiol levels, the total ampules of hMG used and the duration of GnRH-a usage. The duration of GnRH-a usage and the total ampules of hMG used were not correlated. The number of oocytes retrieved and total number of hMG ampules used showed weak correlations with suppressed levels of FSH (-0.297 and 0.285, respectively). However, the fertilization, cleavage and pregnancy rates did not correlate with the LH, FSH and estradiol levels on hMG start days. In conclusion, for selected cases, 10 days of GnRH-a administration is sufficient to suppress endogenous gonadotropin levels. Since FSH and LH are protein hormones and their bioactivity may change in a manner that is unrelated to their immunological levels, it is not necessary to measure FSH, LH and estradiol levels to detect whether suppression is adequate.",Transfection,suppression criterion gnrha cycle predict vitro fertilization outcome addition gonadotropin releasing hormone analog gnrha controlled ovarian hyperstimulation regime reported several advantage reduced cancellation rate fewer premature luteinizations increased clinical pregnancy rate aim study determine effect pituitaryovarian suppression term level luteinizing hormone lh estradiol follicle stimulating hormone fsh duration gnrha administration vitro fertilization ivf outcome retrospectively ivf cycle gnrha human menopausal gonadotropin hmg examined minimum day gnrha administration patient started hmg correlation investigated fertilization rate number retrieved oocyte transferred embryo cancellation rate suppressed lh fsh estradiol level total ampule hmg used duration gnrha usage duration gnrha usage total ampule hmg used correlated number oocyte retrieved total number hmg ampule used showed weak correlation suppressed level fsh respectively however fertilization cleavage pregnancy rate correlate lh fsh estradiol level hmg start day conclusion selected case day gnrha administration sufficient suppress endogenous gonadotropin level since fsh lh protein hormone bioactivity may change manner unrelated immunological level necessary measure fsh lh estradiol level detect whether suppression adequate

7506572,"Induction of T cells specific for the mutated segment of oncogenic P21ras protein by immunization in vivo with the oncogenic protein. Many malignancies harbor mutated ras proto-oncogenes encoding 21 kDa proteins with single amino acid substitutions. Previous studies have shown that the aberrant p21ras proteins are potential tumor-specific antigens in that CD4+ class II major histocompatibility complex-restricted T cells specific for the mutated segment of various oncogenic p21ras proteins can be elicited by immunization in vivo with synthetic peptides corresponding to the mutated segment. T-cell recognition of an antigenic peptide within a protein may be influenced substantially, either positively or negatively, by flanking amino acid sequences as well as by more distal immunogenic or tolerogenic epitopes within the same protein. This study examined whether T cells specific for the mutated segment of an oncogenic p21ras protein can be elicited by immunization in vivo with the protein. The results showed that p21ras protein bearing the transforming single amino acid substitution of leucine for glutamine at residue 61 could elicit T cells specifically reactive to the mutated region of the protein in C3H/HeN mice. Thus, an abnormal p21ras protein specifically associated with malignant transformation can be immunogenic in vivo.

A clinical trial of once-daily administration of a 125-mg tablet of terbinafine, an oral antimycotic agent, was performed on patients with tinea unguium to evaluate its efficacy, safety, possible side-effects and its incorporation into nails and hair. Thirty-four patients were recruited into the study. For the statistical analysis, one of these patients was used only for the safety rating. Accordingly, 33 patients were used for the efficacy rating, and all 34 patients were employed for the safety rating. The efficacy rating in the overall efficacy evaluation was 90.9% (30/33). No adverse effects, including abnormal changes in laboratory test values, were observed. A pharmacokinetic study revealed that terbinafine was detected in the nail tissue at and after week 2. It reached 0.78 ng mg-1 at the end of week 12 and remained at almost the same level thereafter. Terbinafine was also detected in hair at and after week 23. The average value was 3.14 ng mg-1.

7508981,"Single anion channels reconstituted from cardiac mitoplasts. Ion channels from sheep cardiac mitoplast (inverted inner mitochondrial membrane vesicle) preparations were incorporated into voltage-clamped planar lipid bilayers. The appearance of anion rather than cation channels could be promoted by exposing the bilayers to osmotic gradients formed by Cl- salts of large, relatively impermeant, cations at a pH of 8.8. Two distinct activities were identified. These comprised a multisubstate anion channel of intermediate conductance (approximately 60 pS in 300 vs. 50 mM choline Cl, approximately 100 pS in symmetric 150 mM KCl), and a lower-conductance anion channel (approximately 25 or approximately 50 pS in similar conditions), which only displayed two well-defined substates, at approximately 25 and approximately 50% of the fully open state. The larger channels were not simple multiples of the lower-conductance channels, but both discriminated poorly, and to a similar extent, between anions and cations (PCl-/Pcholine+ approximately 12, PCl-/PK+ approximately 8). The lower-conductance channel was only minimally selective between different anions (PNO3-(1.0) = PCl- > PBr- > PI- > PSCN-(0.8)), and its conductance failed to saturate even in high (> 1.0 M) activities of KCl. The channels were not obviously voltage dependent, and they were unaffected by 0.5 mM SITS, H2O2, propranolol, quinine or amitriptyline, or by 2 mM ATP, or by variations in pH (5.5-8.8).

7500843,"Effects of morphine on forskolin-stimulated pro-enkephalin mRNA levels in rat striatum: a model for acute and chronic opioid actions in brain. Opioid agonists inhibit adenylyl cyclase in brain through Gi-coupled receptors. One potential biological role for this reaction would be to decrease pro-enkephalin mRNA synthesis by decreasing intracellular cAMP levels and preventing stimulation of gene expression via the cAMP regulatory element (CRE). To determine whether such effects occur in vivo, rats were injected i.c.v. with a water-soluble analog of forskolin, 7-beta-deacetyl-7 beta[gamma-(morpholino-butyryl] butyryl] forskolin (DMB-forskolin), to stimulate the CRE. Pro-enkephalin mRNA levels were assayed in striatum by Northern blot analysis. The treatment with the forskolin analog increased striatal pro-enkephalin mRNA levels approximately 2-fold in 4 h. When rats were injected with morphine (20 mg/kg i.p.) 1 h before DMB-forskolin administration, the stimulation of pro-enkephalin mRNA levels was eliminated. This acute effect of morphine was blocked by co-administration with 10 mg/kg naloxone. When rats were chronically treated with morphine for 8 days, then injected with morphine (20 mg/kg i.p.) 1 h before DMB-forskolin administration, the inhibitory effect of morphine was lost (i.e. DMB-forskolin increased pro-enkephalin mRNA levels by 2 fold in either control and morphine-treated rats).

7493052,"Intramolecular cross-linking of oxy hemoglobin by bis sulfosuccinimidyl suberate and sebacate: generation of cross-linked hemoglobin with reduced oxygen affinity. The sulfosuccinimidyl esters of suberic and sebacic acids readily introduce intramolecular crosslinks into oxy HbA at pH 7.4, the relative efficiency of crosslinking by the suberate ester being slightly higher than that of sebacate. Nearly quantitative intramolecular crosslinking of HbA (0.5 mM) is achieved at pH 7.4 and 4 degrees C by using 5 and 10 fold molar excess of the suberic and sebacic acid, respectively. In contrast to the facile crosslinking reaction seen with the bis sulfosuccinimidyl sebacate, bis sulfosuccinimidyl sebacate and bis (3:5 dibromo salicyl) sebacate did not introduce any crosslinking into HbA despite the fact that the 'crosslinking arm' of the two bifunctional reagents is the same. The discrepant reactivity of the two reagents demonstrates the 'steering' influence of the negative charge of the leaving group of the reagent, namely sulfo succinimidyl moiety to specific domains of HbA rich in positively charged groups. A second advantage is also anticipated in the use of the sulfosuccinimidyl esters of aliphatic dicarboxylic acids. We speculate that the intermediate in the crosslinking reaction mimics the structural aspects of the low oxygen affinity 'psuedo crosslinked Hb'. Conversion of the low oxygen affinity 'psuedocrosslinked Hb' into crosslinked Hb by the formation of the second isopeptide bond may lead to the 'freezing in' of the elements of low oxygen affinity structure. Consistent with this speculation, the suberate crosslinked Hb indeed exhibited low oxygen affinity even though the crosslinking reaction was carried out in the oxy state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Transfection,intramolecular crosslinking oxy hemoglobin bi sulfosuccinimidyl suberate sebacate generation crosslinked hemoglobin reduced oxygen affinity sulfosuccinimidyl ester suberic sebacic acid readily introduce intramolecular crosslinks oxy hba ph relative efficiency crosslinking suberate ester slightly higher sebacate nearly quantitative intramolecular crosslinking hba mm achieved ph degree using fold molar excess suberic sebacic acid respectively contrast facile crosslinking reaction seen bi sulfosuccinimidyl sebacate bi sulfosuccinimidyl sebacate bi dibromo salicyl sebacate introduce crosslinking hba despite fact crosslinking arm two bifunctional reagent discrepant reactivity two reagent demonstrates steering influence negative charge leaving group reagent namely sulfo succinimidyl moiety specific domain hba rich positively charged group second advantage also anticipated use sulfosuccinimidyl ester aliphatic dicarboxylic acid speculate intermediate crosslinking reaction mimic structural aspect low oxygen affinity psuedo crosslinked hb conversion low oxygen affinity psuedocrosslinked hb crosslinked hb formation second isopeptide bond may lead freezing element low oxygen affinity structure consistent speculation suberate crosslinked hb indeed exhibited low oxygen affinity even though crosslinking reaction carried oxy stateabstract truncated word

The Sod2 gene for Mn-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), an intramitochondrial free radical scavenging enzyme that is the first line of defense against superoxide produced as a byproduct of oxidative phosphorylation, was inactivated by homologous recombination. Homozygous mutant mice die within the first 10 days of life with a dilated cardiomyopathy, accumulation of lipid in liver and skeletal muscle, and metabolic acidosis. Cytochemical analysis revealed a severe reduction in succinate dehydrogenase (complex II) and aconitase (a TCA cycle enzyme) activities in the heart and, to a lesser extent, in other organs.

The treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia is changing, with many new modalities being tested: Some are already used routinely, others are still investigational. Surgery, however, is still the principal treatment, producing an 85-90% improvement in symptoms and urodynamics. Stents are being used more frequently, particularly in patients with a high operative risk. Balloon dilation can be performed in small glands; however, the durability of results remains in doubt. Thermotherapy has been found to produce histologic changes in the prostate and may change the urodynamics as well.

7503448,"[Analysis of mineral composition of femoral bones in the human fetus]. The actual paper presents the method and results of studies covering bone mineralization processes on the basis of analyzing selected elements. The aim of the study has been: 1) determination of the content of more important elements in fetal femoral bones, 2) thorough study of fluorine concentration changes in fetal bones at various fetal life period, 3) finding out whether there are statistically significant differences between the contents of elements forming the bone--at respective stages of fetal development. The material comprised 66 femoral bones of human fetuses being of different age: Ca, Mg, Zn and Fe were determined with an atomic spectrophotometer, P colorimetrically, and F potentiometrically. The performed studies have revealed an increase of Ca and P with the age. Magnesium content was also rising, but less regularly. The process of fluorine cumulation was evidenced too. On the basis of the studies the following conclusions have been drawn, namely: The results of analyzing the bone mineral content furnish an insight into the course of the fetal skeletal formation process. Fluorine content in fetal femoral bones fails to correlate with the level of calcium and phosphate, which reflects the lack of evident influence exerted by fluorine upon the mineralization processes proceeding at this period of life. Placenta does not provide an effective barrier for fluorine transport into the bones of the growing fetus.

Autoradiographic data from transgenic mice carrying the human Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase gene demonstrate an increase in mu-opioid receptor concentration in dopaminergic-related areas and the central grey area. The relative potencies of mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptor agonists to induce antinociception in heterozygous and homozygous superoxide dismutase transgenic mice as well as four inbred strains were assessed to determine the functional significance of the increased receptor concentration. Increased superoxide dismutase activity results in an increased sensitivity to mu-agonists in a gene dosage-dependent manner. SOD/Tg/hom mice were less sensitive to the delta-agonist than were SOD/Tg/het mice. The superoxide dismutase transgene did not affect kappa-opioid receptor agonist sensitivity. These data suggest that delta-opioid receptors are not regulated in the same manner as mu-opioid receptors and that kappa-opioid receptors are unaffected by superoxide dismutase activity.",Transfection,transgenic superoxide dismutase mouse differ opioidinduced analgesia autoradiographic data transgenic mouse carrying human cuznsuperoxide dismutase gene demonstrate increase muopioid receptor concentration dopaminergicrelated area central grey area relative potency mu delta kappaopioid receptor agonist induce antinociception heterozygous homozygous superoxide dismutase transgenic mouse well four inbred strain assessed determine functional significance increased receptor concentration increased superoxide dismutase activity result increased sensitivity muagonists gene dosagedependent manner sodtghom mouse le sensitive deltaagonist sodtghet mouse superoxide dismutase transgene affect kappaopioid receptor agonist sensitivity data suggest deltaopioid receptor regulated manner muopioid receptor kappaopioid receptor unaffected superoxide dismutase activity

In a serological laboratory with a routine service for determining autoantibodies to human neutrophils, antibodies giving a selective or preferential reaction with the nucleus or perinuclear area of neutrophils are not uncommon. The aim of this study was to look for clinical correlates with the presence of such neutrophil-reactive autoantibodies. The specificity of such antibodies for nuclear or cytoplasmic antigens was studied in 65 consecutive sera displaying nuclear/perinuclear reactivity at a titre of at least 80 using the indirect immunofluorescence technique (IIF) on ethanol-fixed leucocytes. The sera were also investigated by IIF on formalin-acetone fixed leucocytes and on HEp-2 cells. ELISA techniques were used to measure antibodies to azurophil granule constituents (ANCA), purified myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA), and lactoferrin (LF-ANCA). Furthermore a qualitative spot immunoassay was used for the detection of antibodies to alpha, beta, and gamma fractions, and the nuclear fraction of neutrophils, purified proteinase 3 (PR3), MPO, enolase, lysozyme, elastase, lactoferrin, and cathepsin G. The diagnoses linked to such GS-ANA/pANCA positivity were arthritides, vasculitides, inflammatory bowel disease and chronic hepatic conditions. MPO was the main antigen recognized in the vasculitis group, but apart from that, rather limited antigen reactivity was demonstrable by these techniques, lysozyme being the most frequently recognized autoantigen in patients with arthritides. Human lymphocytes served as a suitable control substrate when distinguishing between GS-ANA/pANCA and ANA, whereas HEp-2 cells usually could not be used if both classes of antibodies were present in a sample.

7495226,"Vitamins E and C, beta-carotene, and other carotenoids as antioxidants. Tocopherols and tocotrienols (vitamin E), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and the carotenoids react with free radicals, notably peroxyl radicals, and with singlet molecular oxygen (1O2), which is the basis for their function as antioxidants. RRR-alpha-Tocopherol is the major peroxyl radical scavenger in biological lipid phases such as membranes or low-density lipoproteins. Ascorbic acid is present in aqueous compartments (eg, cytosol, plasma, and other body fluids) and can reduce the tocopherol radical; it also has several metabolically important cofactor functions in enzyme reactions, especially hydroxylations. These micronutrients need to be regenerated on oxidation in the biological setting, hence the need for further coupling to nonradical reducing systems such as glutathione-glutathione disulfide, dihydrolipoate-lipoate, or NADPH-NADP+ and NADH-NAD+. Carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, lycopene, and some oxycarotenoids, eg, zeaxanthin and lutein, exert antioxidant functions in lipid phases by quenching 1O2 or free radicals. There are pronounced differences in tissue carotenoid patterns, extending also to the distribution between the all-trans and various cis isomers of the respective carotenoids.

7491109,"A highly conserved region in the hormone-binding domain of the human vitamin D receptor contains residues vital for heterodimerization with retinoid X receptor and for transcriptional activation. Residues located between amino acids 244 and 263 in the human vitamin D receptor (hVDR) show extensive homology with other members of the steroid/thyroid/retinoid hormone receptor superfamily. The corresponding region of the glucocorticoid receptor has been shown to interact with the 90-kilodalton heat shock protein (hsp90), yet hVDR does not appear to bind to hsp90. Herein we report a study of hVDR in which the functional role of five conserved residues was tested by replacing Phe-244, Lys-246, Leu-254, Gln-259, and Leu-262 with glycines by site-directed mutagenesis. Initial screening of these mutants indicated that all were significantly impaired in their ability to activate transcription from a vitamin D-responsive reporter construct when expressed in transfected VDR-deficient COS-7 cells. Further characterization revealed two classes of mutants: the predominant class binds the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ligand normally but is defective in its ability to form a heterodimeric complex with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) on a vitamin D responsive element (VDRE). A second unique class, represented by a single mutant at Lys-246, is normal both with respect to ligand binding and complex formation but still very impaired in transactivation ability. The distinction between these two classes was confirmed by the demonstration that a member of the first class, with a mutation at Gln-259, could be restored to near wild type transactivation ability by supplying excess RXR, while the Lys-246 mutant could not be so rescued. We therefore conclude that the primary function of this conserved domain in hVDR is the mediation of heterodimerization with RXR, leading to VDRE binding and transactivation. The possibility also exists that the Lys-246 mutant may be impaired in a step of transactivation that is distal to complex formation with RXR on the VDRE, perhaps in interactions with the transcriptional machinery itself.",Transfection,highly conserved region hormonebinding domain human vitamin receptor contains residue vital heterodimerization retinoid receptor transcriptional activation residue located amino acid human vitamin receptor hvdr show extensive homology member steroidthyroidretinoid hormone receptor superfamily corresponding region glucocorticoid receptor shown interact kilodalton heat shock protein hsp yet hvdr appear bind hsp herein report study hvdr functional role five conserved residue tested replacing phe lys leu gln leu glycine sitedirected mutagenesis initial screening mutant indicated significantly impaired ability activate transcription vitamin dresponsive reporter construct expressed transfected vdrdeficient co cell characterization revealed two class mutant predominant class bind dihydroxyvitamin ligand normally defective ability form heterodimeric complex retinoid receptor rxr vitamin responsive element vdre second unique class represented single mutant lys normal respect ligand binding complex formation still impaired transactivation ability distinction two class confirmed demonstration member first class mutation gln restored near wild type transactivation ability supplying excess rxr lys mutant rescued therefore conclude primary function conserved domain hvdr mediation heterodimerization rxr leading vdre binding transactivation possibility also exists lys mutant may impaired step transactivation distal complex formation rxr vdre perhaps interaction transcriptional machinery

A single step was then needed for purification to homogeneity of both D. innoxia lectin and mouse tyrosinase. Chaotropic and acidic agents proved to be effective in eluting antigens from Ig-nitrocellulose columns. The binding capacity of particulate nitrocellulose was around 3 mg Ig per milliliter of nitrocellulose, while the purification yields of the two proteins investigated under various eluting conditions were higher than 75%. The applicability of this method in the identification of metabolically labeled proteins in crude extracts is also demonstrated. Purification of proteins by affinity chromatography on their specific Igs linked to nitrocellulose matrices could be performed in both batch and column.

At 30 MHz, the intravascular ultrasound backscatter of blood confounds the discrimination of the lumen from the arterial wall. This study validates a subtraction method which creates a still-frame image with a sharp demarcation of the lumen. The method involves subtraction of consecutive images and 2D ensemble averaging of the absolute pixel values. Subtraction exploits the dynamic properties of flowing red blood cells. Three phantom arteries were used, with erythrocytes in their lumens and wall. For this reason, it was not possible, in one single original image, to discriminate the blood in the lumen from the phantom wall. Based on 26 consecutive original images, in the mean subtraction image contrast between lumen and phantom wall grey values increased eightfold from 10.9 (5.3-19.2) (mean and range) in the original image to 87.7 (73.6-107.0) (P < 0.001). A sufficiently large contrast increase to allow automatic segmentation was obtained by using five original images (0.3-s acquisition time) for any single mean subtraction image. Low blood flow velocities (down to 0.5 cm/s) did not alter this result. Automatic segmentation of the lumen allowed fast 3D reconstruction of the lumen in all three phantom arteries.

The effect of the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (PE) 0.3, 1.0 mumol/L on the amplitude and duration of Iti was observed in the presence of propranolol 0.5 mumol/L to block the beta-adrenoceptor. When the preparation was perfused with PE 1.0 mumol/L for 20, 50 min, the amplitude of Iti decreased from control value 12.8 +/- 1.9 nA to respectively 10.7 +/- 1.2 nA (n = 5, P < 0.05) and 9.6 +/- 1.9 nA (n = 5, P < 0.01).

7487092,"Mechanistic studies of 9-ethynylphenanthrene-inactivated cytochrome P450 2B1. The mechanism of inactivation of the major phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome P450 of rat liver, P450 2B1, by 9-ethynylphenanthrene (9EPh) has been investigated. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry analysis of the cyanogen bromide-generated peptides from 9EPh-inactivated P450 2B1 confirmed the addition of a phenanthrylacetyl group to the peptide corresponding to residues 290 to 314. When this peptide was further digested with pepsin, the site of attachment could be assigned to one of the amino acids in the peptide Phe297 to Leu307 [Roberts, E. S., Hopkins, N. E., Zaluzec, E. J., Gage, D. A., Alworth, W. L., and Hollenberg, P. F. (1995) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 323, 000-000]. The inactivation by 9EPh resulted in a 90-95% loss in the NADPH-supported deethylation of 7-ethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (EFC), but had no effect on the iodosobenzene- or cumene hydroperoxide-supported metabolism of EFC. The loss of NADPH-supported activity was not affected by the addition of cytochrome b5 or the presence of excess levels of reductase. The magnitude of the Type 1 spectral change upon the addition of benzphetamine was decreased with the 9EPh-modified protein. There was no decrease in the ability of modified 2B1 to form the steady-state level of the CO-reduced complex either enzymatically with NADPH and reductase or chemically with sodium dithionite, but the rate of reduction by reductase under anaerobic conditions was 57% that of native protein in the absence of substrate and 35% that of native protein in the presence of substrate. The 9EPh-modified 2B1 had an overall slower rate of NADPH oxidation, H2O2 formation, and formaldehyde formation during metabolism of benzphetamine compared to native 2B1.

The ability of the modified protein to form the steady-state level of the oxygen-iron complex in the presence of cyclohexane was decreased. These results are consistent with the idea that the covalent modification of one of the residues in the peptide Phe297 to Leu307 by the phenanthrylacetyl group impairs the reduction of P450 2B1 by reductase and also causes the uncoupling of NADPH utilization and oxygen consumption from product formation.",Transfection,mechanistic study ethynylphenanthreneinactivated cytochrome mechanism inactivation major phenobarbitalinducible cytochrome rat liver ethynylphenanthrene eph investigated matrixassisted laser desorption ionizationmass spectrometry analysis cyanogen bromidegenerated peptide ephinactivated confirmed addition phenanthrylacetyl group peptide corresponding residue peptide digested pepsin site attachment assigned one amino acid peptide phe leu robert hopkins zaluzec gage alworth hollenberg arch biochem biophys inactivation eph resulted loss nadphsupported deethylation ethoxytrifluoromethylcoumarin efc effect iodosobenzene cumene hydroperoxidesupported metabolism efc loss nadphsupported activity affected addition cytochrome presence excess level reductase magnitude type spectral change upon addition benzphetamine decreased ephmodified protein decrease ability modified form steadystate level coreduced complex either enzymatically nadph reductase chemically sodium dithionite rate reduction reductase anaerobic condition native protein absence substrate native protein presence substrate ephmodified overall slower rate nadph oxidation ho formation formaldehyde formation metabolism benzphetamine compared native ratio ho hcho native modified protein ability modified protein form steadystate level oxygeniron complex presence cyclohexane decreased result consistent idea covalent modification one residue peptide phe leu phenanthrylacetyl group impairs reduction reductase also cause uncoupling nadph utilization oxygen consumption product formation
7475405,"Conservation of energy, uncertainty reduction, and swift utilization of medical care among the elderly: study II. This study examined age differences in the timing of the decision to seek medical care. The data were obtained from a longitudinal study of 366 community dwelling adults aged 45 to 93 years. Subjects were paired for age, gender, and health status, and both members of a pair were interviewed when either one initiated a medical visit for a new problem. This allowed the authors to examine delay in care-seeking for individuals with new symptoms who did not seek care as well as those who did. Survival analysis was used to test hypotheses respecting age differences for total delay (the time from first noticing symptoms until calling for care) and its two constituent phases: appraisal delay (symptom onset until deciding one was ill) and illness delay (decision one was ill until calling for care). Older persons were expected to be more avoidant of uncertainty and conserving of physical and psychic resources and thus quicker to seek care. The results and findings on reasons for delay support the uncertainly avoidance hypothesis but did not replicate signs of higher levels of avoidance behavior by middle-aged subjects than by older subjects.",Transfection,conservation energy uncertainty reduction swift utilization medical care among elderly study ii study examined age difference timing decision seek medical care data obtained longitudinal study community dwelling adult aged year subject paired age gender health status member pair interviewed either one initiated medical visit new problem allowed author examine delay careseeking individual new symptom seek care well survival analysis used test hypothesis respecting age difference total delay time first noticing symptom calling care two constituent phase appraisal delay symptom onset deciding one ill illness delay decision one ill calling care older person expected avoidant uncertainty conserving physical psychic resource thus quicker seek care result finding reason delay support uncertainly avoidance hypothesis replicate sign higher level avoidance behavior middleaged subject older subject
7493940,"CRKL links p210BCR/ABL with paxillin in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. The Philadelphia chromosome translocation generates a chimeric oncogene, BCR/ABL, which causes chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In primary neutrophils from patients with CML, the major novel tyrosine-phosphorylated protein is CRKL, an SH2-SH3-SH3 linker protein which has an overall homology of 60% to CRK, the human homologue of the v-crk oncogene product. Anti-CRKL immunoprecipitates from CML cells, but not normal cells, were found to contain p210BCR/ABL and c-ABL. Several other phosphoproteins were also detected in anti-CRKL immunoprecipitates, one of which has been identified as paxillin, a 68-kDa focal adhesion protein which we have previously shown to be phosphorylated by p210BCR/ABL. Using GST-CRKL fusion proteins, the SH3 domains of CRKL were found to bind c-ABL and p210BCR/ABL, while the SH2 domain of CRKL bound to paxillin, suggesting that CRKL could physically link p210BCR/ABL to paxillin. Paxillin contains three tyrosines in Tyr-X-X-Pro (Y-X-X-P) motifs consistent with amino acid sequences predicted to be optimal for binding to the CRKL-SH2 domain (at positions Tyr-31, Tyr-118, and Tyr-181). Each of these tyrosine residues was mutated to a phenylalanine residue, and in vitro binding assays indicated that paxillin tyrosines at positions 31 and 118, but not 181, are likely to be involved in CRKL-SH2 binding. These results suggest that the p210BCR/ABL oncogene may be physically linked to the focal adhesion-associated protein paxillin in hematopoietic cells by CRKL. This interaction could contribute to the known adhesive defects of CML cells.",Transfection,crkl link pbcrabl paxillin chronic myelogenous leukemia cell philadelphia chromosome translocation generates chimeric oncogene bcrabl cause chronic myelogenous leukemia cml primary neutrophil patient cml major novel tyrosinephosphorylated protein crkl shshsh linker protein overall homology crk human homologue vcrk oncogene product anticrkl immunoprecipitates cml cell normal cell found contain pbcrabl cabl several phosphoprotein also detected anticrkl immunoprecipitates one identified paxillin kda focal adhesion protein previously shown phosphorylated pbcrabl using gstcrkl fusion protein sh domain crkl found bind cabl pbcrabl sh domain crkl bound paxillin suggesting crkl physically link pbcrabl paxillin paxillin contains three tyrosine tyrxxpro yxxp motif consistent amino acid sequence predicted optimal binding crklsh domain position tyr tyr tyr tyrosine residue mutated phenylalanine residue vitro binding assay indicated paxillin tyrosine position likely involved crklsh binding result suggest pbcrabl oncogene may physically linked focal adhesionassociated protein paxillin hematopoietic cell crkl interaction contribute known adhesive defect cml cell
7491270,"Evidence for a glycerol pathway through aquaporin 1 (CHIP28) channels. Permeabilities to glycerol and small non-electrolytes of three Aquaporin 1 CHIP (AQP1) water channels were measured in AQP1 cRNA-injected Xenopus laevis oocytes and in human AQP1 channels reconstituted in proteoliposomes. By an ""osmotic"" swelling assay, significant increases of ethylene glycol, glycerol and 1,3-propanediol apparent permeability coefficients (P'solutes) were found in oocytes expressing human, rat and frog AQP1. p-Chloromercuribenzene sulphonate (pCMBS) and CuSO4 inhibited, by 95% and 58% respectively, apparent glycerol permeability (P'gly) in oocytes expressing human AQP1. pCMBS inhibition was reversed by beta-mercaptoethanol and CuSO4 inhibition was partly reversed by the Cu(2+)-binding peptide Gly-Gly-His. Tritiated glycerol uptakes confirmed the augmented P'gly value of AQP1 cRNA-injected oocytes. In contrast, no increases of urea, meso-erythritol, D-or L-threitol, xylitol and mannitol uptakes were detected. Stopped-flow light scattering experiments performed with human AQP1 proteoliposomes also revealed a much greater increase of P'gly than did those with protein-free liposomes; the initial rate of proteoliposomes also swelling was inhibited by 96.2% with HgCl2 and by 72.5% with CuSO4. In AQP1 cRNA-injected oocytes and in proteoliposomes, the value of the glycerol reflection coefficient was 0.74-0.80, indicating that water and glycerol share the same pathway. All these results provide strong evidence that water and certain small solutes permeate the AQP1 channels expressed at the surface of X. laevis oocytes or reconstituted in proteoliposomes. The urea exclusion suggests that the selectivity of the AQP1 channels not only depends on the size of the solutes but probably also on their flexibility and their ability to form H-bonds.",Transfection,evidence glycerol pathway aquaporin chip channel permeability glycerol small nonelectrolytes three aquaporin chip aqp water channel measured aqp crnainjected xenopus laevis oocyte human aqp channel reconstituted proteoliposomes osmotic swelling assay significant increase ethylene glycol glycerol propanediol apparent permeability coefficient psolutes found oocyte expressing human rat frog aqp pchloromercuribenzene sulphonate pcmbs cuso inhibited respectively apparent glycerol permeability pgly oocyte expressing human aqp pcmbs inhibition reversed betamercaptoethanol cuso inhibition partly reversed cubinding peptide glyglyhis tritiated glycerol uptake confirmed augmented pgly value aqp crnainjected oocyte contrast increase urea mesoerythritol dor lthreitol xylitol mannitol uptake detected stoppedflow light scattering experiment performed human aqp proteoliposomes also revealed much greater increase pgly proteinfree liposome initial rate proteoliposomes also swelling inhibited hgcl cuso aqp crnainjected oocyte proteoliposomes value glycerol reflection coefficient indicating water glycerol share pathway result provide strong evidence water certain small solute permeate aqp channel expressed surface laevis oocyte reconstituted proteoliposomes urea exclusion suggests selectivity aqp channel depends size solute probably also flexibility ability form hbonds
7490010,"Hormones, sex, and status in women. Androgens are often associated with assertive behavior; under what circumstances is this reflected in higher dominance rank? In this study of coresidential college women, androgens (total testosterone, free testosterone, and androstenedione) and estradiol were positively correlated with high self-regard in women (as measured by the degree to which subjects over-ranked themselves in a peer-ranking task) and with infrequent smiling, a behavior that has been associated with dominance in previous studies. Androgens and estradiol were also positively correlated with number of sexual partners. The behaviors engendered by these hormones are often positively correlated with high dominance rank, at least in males. In this population, however, high rank (as judged by peer assessments) was negatively correlated with androgens, particularly androstenedione, and showed a negative trend with estradiol as well. One possible interpretation of these findings is suggested by an evolutionary perspective that sees different routes to status among women who compete for resources directly and women who obtain resources through investing males.",Transfection,hormone sex status woman androgen often associated assertive behavior circumstance reflected higher dominance rank study coresidential college woman androgen total testosterone free testosterone androstenedione estradiol positively correlated high selfregard woman measured degree subject overranked peerranking task infrequent smiling behavior associated dominance previous study androgen estradiol also positively correlated number sexual partner behavior engendered hormone often positively correlated high dominance rank least male population however high rank judged peer assessment negatively correlated androgen particularly androstenedione showed negative trend estradiol well one possible interpretation finding suggested evolutionary perspective see different route status among woman compete resource directly woman obtain resource investing male

In the first experiment, [1(-14)C]sodium acetate was infused into one side of the udder of a lactating goat via the test canal whereas in the second, (1,2-3H]cholesterol was injected intravenously and concurrently with a [14C]acetate intramammary infusion. In both experiments, blood and milk samples were collected at intervals for 6 days postinjection. Maximum unesterified cholesterol specific activity (sp act) in whole milk appeared at 78 hr after intravenous injections of 3H cholesterol and within 3-7 hr after infusion of [14C]acetate. Virtually all the tritium in milk was associated with unesterified cholesterol. The sp act of 14C-labeled cholesterol was only 20% of gland-synthesized decanoic acid. Decanoic acid is known to be completely synthesized in the mammary gland, and, like cholesterol, acetate is its precursor. The results indicate that, although some milk cholesterol is synthesized in the mammary gland, it is derived principally from serum cholesterol. The data show also that serum cholesterol equilibrates with membrane cholesterol of the lactating cell prior to its secretion in milk.",Transfection,origin cholesterol milk study conducted investigate origin milk cholesterol ruminant first experiment csodium acetate infused one side udder lactating goat via test canal whereas second hcholesterol injected intravenously concurrently cacetate intramammary infusion experiment blood milk sample collected interval day postinjection maximum unesterified cholesterol specific activity sp act whole milk appeared hr intravenous injection cholesterol within hr infusion cacetate virtually tritium milk associated unesterified cholesterol sp act clabeled cholesterol glandsynthesized decanoic acid decanoic acid known completely synthesized mammary gland like cholesterol acetate precursor result indicate although milk cholesterol synthesized mammary gland derived principally serum cholesterol data show also serum cholesterol equilibrates membrane cholesterol lactating cell prior secretion milk
7441212,"Gradual changes of influenza virions during passage of undiluted material. Defective influenza virions undergo gradual changes during passage of undiluted material: the amount of RNA in virions diminishes, the equimolarity of the RNA segments is lost and the interfering activity of defective virions decreases. Defective virions of early passages have a small deficiency in genetic material and at a high m.o.i. induce the synthesis of the complete set of virus-specific proteins. Defective virions from later passages are characterized by a considerable deficiency in genetic material and a decrease in the amount of high mol. wt. RNA segments. They do not demonstrate complementation and at a high m.o.i. do not induce the synthesis of virus-specific proteins, thus revealing analogous defects in the genome of the majority of defective virions.

7489760,"Cross-recognition by T cells of an epitope shared by two unrelated mycobacterial antigens. The molecular mimicry represented by cross-recognition of determinants shared by unrelated antigens by antibodies or T cells is of broad immunological interest. In this study, we analyzed the cross-recognition by CD4+ T cells of a peptide epitope shared by two mycobacterial proteins of diverse sequence, represented by the 19-kDa antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the 28-kDa antigen of Mycobacterium leprae. This epitope was immunodominant with respect to the 19-kDa antigen, but cryptic in relation to the 28-kDa antigen. The cross-reactive epitope cores were identified by Pepscan window analysis and found to be eight residues long in both antigens (residues 69-76 and 127-134). Alignment of these octameric sequences revealed two identical and five conservatively related amino acids. Within the epitope core, two residues (73Asn and 76Ile) were identified as critical for recognition on the basis of inhibition of the cross-reactive T cell proliferative response using singly substituted analog peptides. These results suggest that T cell cross-reactive epitopes can exist in proteins with apparently not more than random levels of sequence homology. Their potential for unsuspected cross-sensitization may play a role in the maintenance of T cell memory, in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and possibly in a wide range of host immune responses to infectious pathogens.",Transfection,crossrecognition cell epitope shared two unrelated mycobacterial antigen molecular mimicry represented crossrecognition determinant shared unrelated antigen antibody cell broad immunological interest study analyzed crossrecognition cd cell peptide epitope shared two mycobacterial protein diverse sequence represented kda antigen mycobacterium tuberculosis kda antigen mycobacterium leprae epitope immunodominant respect kda antigen cryptic relation kda antigen crossreactive epitope core identified pepscan window analysis found eight residue long antigen residue alignment octameric sequence revealed two identical five conservatively related amino acid within epitope core two residue asn ile identified critical recognition basis inhibition crossreactive cell proliferative response using singly substituted analog peptide result suggest cell crossreactive epitope exist protein apparently random level sequence homology potential unsuspected crosssensitization may play role maintenance cell memory pathogenesis autoimmune disease possibly wide range host immune response infectious pathogen

7476313,"The insulin-like growth factor system in vascular smooth muscle: interaction with insulin and growth factors. Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) occur throughout the vascular tree and have important physiological functions. They are also involved in pathological processes such as development and progression of atherosclerotic lesions, restenosis following angioplasty, and in hypertension. This review is focused on the role of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system in proliferation, migration, and hypertrophy of vascular SMCs and its interaction with insulin and other growth factors. The IGF-I receptor is highly expressed in SMCs in intact arteries and in cultured SMCs and is activated by binding of IGF-I to the two alpha-subunits. Insulin and IGF-II from the circulation can interact with the IGF-I receptor at higher concentrations. Insulin receptors are few or absent in SMCs and circulating insulin concentrations in vivo are probably too low for a direct action of insulin on the IGF-I receptor in SMCs. Receptor activation initiates a number of signal transduction pathways. Increased phosphatidylinositol turnover and calcium mobilization correlates with actin filament reorganization and stimulation of directed migration of the SMC in a gradient of IGF-I. The effects of IGF-I receptor activation on signal transduction pathways (eg, the MAP kinase cascade) implicated in DNA synthesis and proliferation are weak and this correlates with the meager mitogenic activity of IGF-I in SMC. Several components of the IGF-system in SMC are regulated by growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Transfection,insulinlike growth factor system vascular smooth muscle interaction insulin growth factor vascular smooth muscle cell smcs occur throughout vascular tree important physiological function also involved pathological process development progression atherosclerotic lesion restenosis following angioplasty hypertension review focused role insulinlike growth factor igf system proliferation migration hypertrophy vascular smcs interaction insulin growth factor igfi receptor highly expressed smcs intact artery cultured smcs activated binding igfi two alphasubunits insulin igfii circulation interact igfi receptor higher concentration insulin receptor absent smcs circulating insulin concentration vivo probably low direct action insulin igfi receptor smcs receptor activation initiate number signal transduction pathway increased phosphatidylinositol turnover calcium mobilization correlate actin filament reorganization stimulation directed migration smc gradient igfi effect igfi receptor activation signal transduction pathway eg map kinase cascade implicated dna synthesis proliferation weak correlate meager mitogenic activity igfi smc several component igfsystem smc regulated growth factor plateletderived growth factor pdgfbb basic fibroblast growth factor bfgfabstract truncated word

Because of the significant role of PKC in these inflammatory processes, we evaluated a specific and potent inhibitor of C kinase for efficacy in several in vitro and in vivo murine models of inflammation. Unlike the relatively nonspecific kinase inhibitor staurosporine, the bisindolylmaleimide 3-[1-[-3-(dimethylaminopropyl]-1H-indol-3-yl]- 4-(1H-indol-3-yl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione monohydrochloride (Gö 6850) demonstrated increased selectivity for C kinase in purified enzyme assays (respective IC50 values (microM) for Gö 6850 and staurosporine: protein kinase C (0.032, 0.009); myosin light-chain kinase (0.6, 0.01); protein kinase G (4.6, 0.018); protein kinase A (33, 0.04); tyrosine kinase1 (94, 0.4); tyrosine kinase2 (> 100, > 1)).

To examine the diuretic and natriuretic synergism between bendroflumethiazide (BFTZ) and furosemide (FUR), the acute diuretic and natriuretic response to BFTZ was compared when given alone, during acute and during chronic FUR infusion. Responses to diuretics were assessed in conscious, chronically instrumented rats and, to avoid confounding influences of diuretic-induced volume contraction, extracellular fluid volume was kept constant by a computer-driven servo-control technique. Two groups were pretreated with osmotic minipumps chronically infusing either FUR (0.25 mg/hr; group CF; n = 9) or vehicle (8% ethanolamine; group CV; n = 8) i.p. for 7 days before the experiment. During the experiment, two other groups received either acute infusion with FUR (0.25 mg/hr; group AF; n = 16) or acute infusion with vehicle (150 mM glucose; group AV; n = 11). After a 60-min control period, BFTZ (0.083 mg; 0.25 mg/hr) was administered for 90 min to all four groups. Whereas the diuretic and natriuretic response to BFTZ was similar in groups AF, AV and CV, a supra-additive response was observed in the CF group (vs. group CV: delta urine flow rate: +78%; delta urinary Na excretion: +69%). BFTZ had no effect on the fractional excretion of Li, which suggests that the supra-additive effect was due to inhibition of an enhanced distal tubular Na reabsorption induced by chronic FUR administration.

7469479,"The disposition of cadmium and zinc in Pandalus montagui. Cadmium uptake rates in various tissues of Pandalus montagui exposed to sea water containing 37 micrograms Cd/L for 14 days ranged from 0.002-0.06 microgram/dry tissue/hr. During depuration for 57 days, the levels in most tissues decreased slightly, but continued to rise in the hepatopancreas indicating Cd redistribution. Exposure to 65 micrograms Zn/L produced no substantial change in Zn content of the tissues. An increase occurred in eggs and hepatopancreas during the first six days of depuration. During exposure to Cd and Zn combined (40 micrograms Cd/L + 70 micrograms Zn/L), tissue Zn levels responded as with Zn alone.

7528688,"Acute nephrotoxicity of a carcinogenic iron chelate. Selective inhibition of a proteolytic conversion of alpha 2U-globulin to the kidney fatty acid-binding protein. The mechanism of acute nephrotoxicity of an iron chelate in vivo has been investigated. Administration of a renal carcinogen ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA) (15 mg Fe/kg body weight, intraperitoneally) led to selective loss of a renal protein with an apparent molecular mass of 17 kDa. Analysis of the 17 kDa protein by NH2-terminal sequence demonstrated its identity over 16 NH2-terminal residues as a kidney fatty acid-binding protein (k-FABP) that is a proteolytically modified form of alpha 2U-globulin, a major urinary protein of adult male rats. An immunochemical study using anti-alpha 2U-globulin polyclonal antibodies confirmed that a single injection of Fe-NTA led to a decrease in k-FABP levels. However, a 19-kDa protein identical to the alpha 2U-globulin progressively appeared in the kidney, suggesting that the proteolytic processing of alpha 2U-globulin in the renal proximal tubules was suppressed by the treatment with Fe-NTA. By monitoring k-FABP and its precursor alpha 2U-globulin, it was determined that repeated exposure to Fe-NTA caused suppression of both proteolytic and endocytotic activity of the kidney.

Selectin interactions with glycolipids have been examined previously under static conditions, whereas physiologic interactions mediated by selectins take place under flow. We find that under physiologic flow conditions, sialyl Lewis(x) (sLe(x)) glycolipid and sialyl Lewisa (sLe(a)) neoglycolipid support tethering and rolling adhesions of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing E-selectin and lymphoid and myeloid cells expressing L-selectin. These selectin-mediated adhesions persist at the highest shear stresses that occur in postcapillary venules in vivo and occur at lower site densities than found for sLe(x) on neutrophils. The interactions are Ca(2+)-dependent and can be specifically and completely blocked with anti-selectin mAbs. Asialo nonfucosylated glycolipids are inactive, and sulfatide supports weak tethering, but not rolling, of L-selectin-expressing cells.

7536413,"A role for protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation in eliciting glucagon desensitization in rat hepatocytes. An immobilized hepatocyte preparation was used to show that both vasopressin and glucagon could desensitize the ability of glucagon to increase intracellular cyclic AMP concentrations. This process was not dependent on any influx of extracellular Ca2+ and was not mediated by any rise in the intracellular level of Ca2+. The protein kinase C-selective inhibitors chelerythrine, staurosporine and calphostin C acted as potent inhibitors of the desensitization process but with various degrees of selectivity regarding their ability to inhibit the desensitizing actions of glucagon and vasopressin. The protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid was just as potent as vasopressin and glucagon in causing desensitization. Treatment of hepatocyte membranes with alkaline phosphatase restored to near control levels the ability of glucagon to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity in membranes from both glucagon- and vasopressin-treated (desensitized) hepatocytes.

7519312,"Multiple regression analysis of cytogenetic human data. Biomonitoring studies on cytogenetic outcomes in humans should be considered as epidemiological studies, rather than randomized trials. Under this light the emphasis given to the achievement of a significant p-value should be reduced, since this measure suffers from major limitations. The use of a point estimate (and its corresponding confidence interval) to measure the association between exposure and effect offers several advantages, including the adjustment for confounding, and the evaluation of possible interaction between factors. In most instances the use of multivariate statistical methods allows an efficient analysis of these studies, even in presence of a small sample size and several covariates. In this paper we re-analyzed four biomonitoring studies by using multivariate methods to estimate relative risks through statistical modeling. The use of multiple regression techniques allowed the computation of point estimates of association and their confidence intervals for each covariate evaluated by the studies considered; the estimate of the effect of confounding variables such as smoking habits, age and gender; and the presence of interaction between covariates. Measures of association estimated through univariate and multivariate statistical approaches are compared.

7519233,"Effects of dexamethasone on muscle protein homeostasis and on calpain and calpastatin activities and gene expression in rabbits. The objectives were to investigate the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids control proteolysis in muscle cells and the relationship between the calpain:calpastatin system and proteolysis in muscle. Female rabbits were treated with 1 mg dexamethasone (Dex)/kg body weight per day for 0, 1, 2 or 4 days after which animals were killed and muscle samples taken for analyses. Dex reduced urinary N tau-methylhistidine (NMH) 48% (day 4 versus day 1 of Dex treatment) and muscle NMH concentrations by 49% (day 1) to 40% (day 2) respectively, suggesting that protein degradation was reduced. To investigate whether the changes in apparent proteolysis were related to calpains, we examined the effects of Dex on muscle calpain and calpastatin activities. These were unaffected by Dex. This implies that Dex-dependent changes in degradation are not mediated by changes in muscle calpain or calpastatin activities. We studied the effects of Dex on calpain and calpastatin gene expression as a means of clarifying the relationships between proteinase gene expression and proteinase activities. mu-Calpain mRNA concentration was unaffected by Dex but m-calpain mRNA and calpastatin mRNA concentrations were reduced by 42-55% and 40% respectively. Dex had a similar effect on beta-actin mRNA. Although calpain and calpastatin genes behaved as house-keeping genes, changes in their expression mimicked apparent changes in proteolysis. The observation that calpain and calpastatin activities were unchanged indicates that additional regulation of the calpain:calpastatin system exists at other sites in muscle cells.

7534803,"Nested sets of protein fragments and their use in epitope mapping: characterization of the epitope for the S4D5 monoclonal antibody binding to receptor associated protein. The present report describes a new general procedure by which linear and some structure-dependent epitopes may be mapped in a protein antigen using a nested set of protein fragments prepared from partial proteolysis products of a recombinant protein. Briefly, the antigen, fused to an affinity tag, is partially fragmented and affinity sorted under denaturing conditions to produce a nested set of polypeptides, consisting of N- (or C-)terminal fragments. Immunoblots of SDS-PAGE fractionated sets of fragments are therefore directly readable in terms of molecular mass--i.e., approximate sequence positions--that identify sequence segments harbouring an epitope and any additional structural elements, required to maintain epitope conformation. Blots of N- and C-terminal nested sets of polypeptide fragments representing the human receptor associated protein (RAP) were prepared and probed with mAb S4D5 (Moestrup and Gliemann, 1991). Fragments 1-177 and 94-323 were the shortest fragments detected by the antibody, suggesting the presence of an epitope within the 94-177 segment. Independent mapping based on recombinant fragments of the RAP homologue, rat Heymann nephritis antigen, confirmed that the epitope resides in the Pro115-Asp177 segment.

The regulation of tight-junction permeability between enterocytes has been studied using in vitro perfused loops, Ussing chambers, and cultured cell monolayers. In this communication we demonstrate the ability of an in vivo perfusion model to monitor tight-junction permeability and respond appropriately to physiological luminal stimuli. By using the highly charged anionic ferrocyanide molecule, water flux could be accurately assessed in the rat, and the luminal clearance of high molecular weight dextrans could be used to probe the opening and closing of the paracellular pathway. By utilizing two different molecular weight dextrans markers simultaneously, each conjugated with a different fluorophore, we were able to calculate luminal clearances of these compounds by fluorometric techniques in the presence of luminal nutrients that have previously been demonstrated to open intercellular tight junctions. In the absence of luminal nutrients or the presence of a non-nutrient sugar such as mannitol, clearance of these compounds was negligible. However, with the addition of either D-glucose or L-alanine, clearance of both high molecular weight markers increased dramatically. Thus, opening of tight junctions between enterocytes appears to be a physiological event that occurs in vivo under conditions likely to be found in the lumen.

7508962,"Characterization of a hair (wool) keratin intermediate filament gene domain. In epithelial differentiation keratin intermediate filament genes are expressed in multifarious tissue-specific and stage-specific patterns. Pairs of type I and type II intermediate filament genes, belonging to multigene families, are coordinately regulated, and 4-5 genes of each type are expressed in the hair follicle. Accumulating chromosomal mapping data points to a major locus for each intermediate filament multigene family on separate chromosomes. In this report we describe the isolation of a sheep hair keratin cosmid by chromosome walking that overlaps two previously described cosmids and establishes a continuous 100-kb segment of cloned DNA containing three hair and three hair-like type II intermediate filament keratin genes. A new hair keratin type II intermediate filament gene, KRT2.11, is located in the middle of the cluster, and partial sequence data reveal a striking conservation of its predicted N-terminal region with other sheep hair keratin type II intermediate filament proteins. Expression analyses demonstrate the presence of a 2.4-kb KRT2.11 transcript in wool follicle RNA and show that expression occurs in the follicle cortical keratinocytes above the dermal papilla.

7529507,"Evaluation of proviral copy number and plasma RNA level as early indicators of progression in HIV-1 infection: correlation with virological and immunological markers of disease. We compared the proviral DNA level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), viral RNA level in plasma, presence of p24 antigen in serum, viral phenotype, and results of immunological markers of HIV-1 disease. Consecutive samples of 62 HIV-1-infected patients, representing all stages of disease were tested for proviral DNA in PBMC and viral RNA in plasma using a semi-quantitative limiting dilution polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The presence of a syncytium-inducing (SI) phenotype was assessed after direct cocultivation of patient PBMC with MT-2 cells. Results of the quantitative PCR and the MT-2 coculture were correlated with the clinical stage of the disease, with the number of CD4+ T cells, and with the results of other virological and immunological markers, such as the level of p24 antigen, beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) and neopterin. Significant differences were observed between the results for asymptomatic and symptomatic patients for all markers under study. In the group of asymptomatic patients with a CD4+ T-cell count > 200 x 10(6)/l, patients with high amounts of proviral DNA had significantly higher amounts of beta 2M, neopterin and viral RNA, they were more frequently p24 antigen-positive and harboured more frequently SI strains than patients with low amounts of proviral DNA. A good correlation between the proviral DNA and the viral RNA levels was observed. Significant changes of viral RNA but not proviral DNA levels were observed after initiation of therapy or when therapy failed. We demonstrated the relationship between high proviral DNA level in PBMC, high viral load in plasma, elevated beta 2M and neopterin concentrations in serum, and the presence of p24 antigen in serum in a group of asymptomatic patients with a CD4+ T-cell count > 200 x 10(6)/l. We suggest the possible usefulness of proviral load as an early indicator of disease progression. The presence of SI strains is highly correlated with disease; however, SI strains were detected in only 46% of symptomatic patients.

The localization of tachykinin-immunoreactivity in the cat visual cortex (area 17) was investigated using immunohistochemical methods. Strong laminar specificity was observed, with immunoreactivity highest in layer V, followed by layers I, VI, II and III, and the lowest density in layer IV. Most of the immunoreactive product was localized in neuronal processes. A few immunopositive cell bodies were also present. The immunopositive neurons were non-pyramidal, multipolar, or bipolar in shape, and mostly found in layer V.

7511700,"Expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. The growth and differentiation of neural precursor cells in the central nervous system (CNS) are regulated by their response to polypeptide growth factors which interact with specific transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). We demonstrate that rat oligodendrocyte-type 2 astrocyte (O-2A) glial progenitor cells, precursors of the myelin-forming cells in the CNS, express the transmembrane RTK c-kit, the gene product of the murine dominant white spotting (W) locus and receptor for stem cell factor. Expression of c-kit transcripts and immunoreactive protein is lost when O-2A progenitors differentiate into post-mitotic oligodendrocytes. Analysis of developing rat brain revealed an increase in the expression of c-kit transcripts between postnatal days 10 and 12, a window of time preceding the emergence of oligodendrocytes and the onset of myelination in vivo.

Previous studies suggested that gamma 87 Gln in hemoglobin (Hb) F is an important site for promoting inhibition of Hb S (alpha 2 beta 2(6 Glu-->Val) polymerization by Hb F. We engineered and isolated the double mutant (Hb alpha 2 beta 2(6 Glu-->Val,87 Thr-->Gln) using a yeast expression system and characterized polymerization properties of this modified tetramer in an effort to clarify the role of Gln at position 87 in inhibiting Hb S polymerization. Electrophoretic mobility and absorption spectra of this double mutant were the same as that of Hb S, while oxygen affinity was higher, and effects of organic phosphates on oxygen affinity were reduced. The deoxy form of the double mutant showed a characteristic delay time prior to polymerization in vitro. The critical concentration for polymerization of the double mutant was about 1.5 times higher than Hb S, and delay and polymerization times were much longer than Hb S at the same hemoglobin concentrations. The logarithmic plot of delay time versus hemoglobin concentration for the double mutant showed a straight line that was intermediate between lines for AS and FS mixtures. These results and those of kinetics of polymerization of Hb S/double mutant mixtures indicate that substitution of Gln for Thr at beta 87 in Hb S prolongs delay time and inhibits polymerization, although the double mutant forms polymers like Hb S.",Epigenetics,role gamma gln inhibition hemoglobin polymerization hemoglobin previous study suggested gamma gln hemoglobin hb important site promoting inhibition hb alpha beta gluval polymerization hb engineered isolated double mutant hb alpha beta gluval thrgln using yeast expression system characterized polymerization property modified tetramer effort clarify role gln position inhibiting hb polymerization electrophoretic mobility absorption spectrum double mutant hb oxygen affinity higher effect organic phosphate oxygen affinity reduced deoxy form double mutant showed characteristic delay time prior polymerization vitro critical concentration polymerization double mutant time higher hb delay polymerization time much longer hb hemoglobin concentration logarithmic plot delay time versus hemoglobin concentration double mutant showed straight line intermediate line f mixture result kinetics polymerization hb sdouble mutant mixture indicate substitution gln thr beta hb prolongs delay time inhibits polymerization although double mutant form polymer like hb
7509586,"Identification and characterization of a new plasmid carrying genes for degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate from Pseudomonas cepacia CSV90. Pseudomonas cepacia CSV90 is able to utilize 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate (2,4-D) and 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetate as sole sources of carbon and energy. Mutants of the strain CSV90 which had lost this ability appeared spontaneously on a nonselective medium. The wild-type strain harbored a 90-kb plasmid, pMAB1, whereas 2,4-D-negative mutants either lost the plasmid or had a 70-kb plasmid, pMAB2. The plasmid pMAB2 was found to have undergone a deletion of a 20-kb fragment of pMAB1. The plasmid-free mutants regained the ability to degrade 2,4-D after introduction of purified pMAB1 by electroporation. Cloning in Escherichia coli of a 10-kb BamHI fragment from pMAB1, the region absent in pMAB2, resulted in the expression of the gene tfdC encoding 3,5-dichlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase. After subcloning, the tfdC gene was located in a 1.6-kb HindIII fragment. The nucleotide sequence of the tfdC gene and the restriction map of its contiguous region are identical to those of the well-characterized 2,4-D-degradative plasmid pJP4 of Alcaligenes eutrophus, whereas the overall restriction maps of the two plasmids are different.

7509448,"Structural and functional aspects of the multiplicity of Neu differentiation factors. We used molecular cloning and functional analyses to extend the family of Neu differentiation factors (NDFs) and to explore the biochemical activity of different NDF isoforms. Exhaustive cloning revealed the existence of six distinct fibroblastic pro-NDFs, whose basic transmembrane structure includes an immunoglobulin-like motif and an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain. Structural variation is confined to three domains: the C-terminal portion of the EGF-like domain (isoforms alpha and beta), the adjacent juxtamembrane stretch (isoforms 1 to 4), and the variable-length cytoplasmic domain (isoforms a, b, and c). Only certain combinations of the variable domains exist, and they display partial tissue specificity in their expression: pro-NDF-alpha 2 is the predominant form in mesenchymal cells, whereas pro-NDF-beta 1 is the major neuronal isoform. Only the transmembrane isoforms were glycosylated and secreted as biologically active 44-kDa glycoproteins, implying that the transmembrane domain functions as an internal signal peptide. Extensive glycosylation precedes proteolytic cleavage of pro-NDF but has no effect on receptor binding. By contrast, the EGF-like domain fully retains receptor binding activity when expressed separately, but its beta-type C terminus displays higher affinity than alpha-type NDFs. Likewise, structural heterogeneity of the cytoplasmic tails may determine isoform-specific rate of pro-NDF processing. Taken together, these results suggest that different NDF isoforms are generated by alternative splicing and perform distinct tissue-specific functions.",Epigenetics,structural functional aspect multiplicity neu differentiation factor used molecular cloning functional analysis extend family neu differentiation factor ndfs explore biochemical activity different ndf isoforms exhaustive cloning revealed existence six distinct fibroblastic prondfs whose basic transmembrane structure includes immunoglobulinlike motif epidermal growth factor egflike domain structural variation confined three domain cterminal portion egflike domain isoforms alpha beta adjacent juxtamembrane stretch isoforms variablelength cytoplasmic domain isoforms certain combination variable domain exist display partial tissue specificity expression prondfalpha predominant form mesenchymal cell whereas prondfbeta major neuronal isoform transmembrane isoforms glycosylated secreted biologically active kda glycoprotein implying transmembrane domain function internal signal peptide extensive glycosylation precedes proteolytic cleavage prondf effect receptor binding contrast egflike domain fully retains receptor binding activity expressed separately betatype terminus display higher affinity alphatype ndfs likewise structural heterogeneity cytoplasmic tail may determine isoformspecific rate prondf processing taken together result suggest different ndf isoforms generated alternative splicing perform distinct tissuespecific function
7505014,"Expression of GlyCAM-1, an endothelial ligand for L-selectin, is affected by afferent lymphatic flow. The interaction of naive, L-selectin-bearing lymphocytes with counterreceptors on the surface of high endothelial venules (HEV) is the initial step in the extravasation of these cells from the bloodstream into the peripheral lymph node. Recently, two sulfated glycoprotein ligands, 50 and 90 kDa, respectively, have been identified as ligands for L-selectin using an L-selectin-IgG chimera. cDNA cloning of one of these molecules, the 50-kDa sulfated glycoprotein (glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule 1 [GlyCAM-1]), has shown it to be a mucinlike scaffold that presents a carbohydrate ligand(s) to the lectin domain of L-selectin. Herein, we analyze the factors that might regulate the expression of these ligands. Ligation of afferent lymphatics results in a complete loss of the mRNA for GlyCAM-1. In addition, L-selectin-mediated adhesion, as inferred by binding of an L-selectin-IgG chimera, is also lost on interruption of afferent flow. It thus appears that a soluble and/or cellular component(s) of afferent lymph regulates the expression of GlyCAM-1 mRNA and the resultant HEV adhesiveness for lymphocytes.",Epigenetics,expression glycam endothelial ligand lselectin affected afferent lymphatic flow interaction naive lselectinbearing lymphocyte counterreceptors surface high endothelial venule hev initial step extravasation cell bloodstream peripheral lymph node recently two sulfated glycoprotein ligand kda respectively identified ligand lselectin using lselectinigg chimera cdna cloning one molecule kda sulfated glycoprotein glycosylationdependent cell adhesion molecule glycam shown mucinlike scaffold present carbohydrate ligand lectin domain lselectin herein analyze factor might regulate expression ligand ligation afferent lymphatics result complete loss mrna glycam addition lselectinmediated adhesion inferred binding lselectinigg chimera also lost interruption afferent flow thus appears soluble andor cellular component afferent lymph regulates expression glycam mrna resultant hev adhesiveness lymphocyte
7498658,"Subcellular localization of hepatitis B core antigen in relation to hepatocyte regeneration in chronic hepatitis B. To test whether the dominant cytoplasmic expression of hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) in active chronic hepatitis B is secondary to liver damage and regeneration, the relationship between subcellular localization of HBcAg, liver inflammatory activity, and hepatocyte regeneration in chronic hepatitis B was studied. Correlation of the clinical and laboratory data with the topographical distribution of HBcAg was studied in 30 patients. The subcellular localization of HBcAg in relation to hepatocyte cell cycles was studied by double immunostaining of HBcAg and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Patients with predominant cytoplasmic HBcAg had significantly higher levels of biochemical and histological activities and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression than patients with predominant nuclear HBcAg. The levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression correlated positively with biochemical and histological activities and degrees of cytoplasmic HBcAg expression but negatively with degrees of nuclear HbcAg expression. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression was shown in 49% of hepatocytes with cytoplasmic HBcAg but in only 2% of hepatocytes with nuclear HBcAg. These findings suggested that, following liver damage, the regeneration of surviving hepatocytes might cause the shift of intracellular HBcAg from nucleus to cytoplasm. As a result, the extent of nuclear HBcAg expression reduces with concomitant increase in cytoplasmic HBcAg expression.",Epigenetics,subcellular localization hepatitis core antigen relation hepatocyte regeneration chronic hepatitis test whether dominant cytoplasmic expression hepatitis core antigen hbcag active chronic hepatitis secondary liver damage regeneration relationship subcellular localization hbcag liver inflammatory activity hepatocyte regeneration chronic hepatitis studied correlation clinical laboratory data topographical distribution hbcag studied patient subcellular localization hbcag relation hepatocyte cell cycle studied double immunostaining hbcag proliferating cell nuclear antigen patient predominant cytoplasmic hbcag significantly higher level biochemical histological activity proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression patient predominant nuclear hbcag level proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression correlated positively biochemical histological activity degree cytoplasmic hbcag expression negatively degree nuclear hbcag expression proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression shown hepatocytes cytoplasmic hbcag hepatocytes nuclear hbcag finding suggested following liver damage regeneration surviving hepatocytes might cause shift intracellular hbcag nucleus cytoplasm result extent nuclear hbcag expression reduces concomitant increase cytoplasmic hbcag expression

To modify RBC aggregation, 2 and/or 10% dextran (molecular weights 40,000, 70,000 or 480,000) or fresh rat plasma was infused into adult male rats via a normovolemic hemodilution procedure. The high-molecular-weight dextrans (70,000 and 480,000) both induced RBC hyperaggregation associated with similar dose-dependent decreases in RBC arteriolar velocity (30 and 40% for dextran concentrations of 2 and 10%, respectively) and in PCD (35 and 37%, respectively, for the two concentrations). Conversely, with 40,000 molecular weight dextran or plasma, we observed a 30% increase in RBC arteriolar velocity, but no change in PCD or hyperaggregation. Intravenous injection of the antiaggregating drug troxerutin (10(-3) M), either before or after 2% dextran 70,000, significantly inhibited the effects of this dextran on RBC arteriolar velocity and on PCD.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the benefits of incorporating rapid cytokeratin (CK) stains into Mohs technique. Simple modification of standard immunoenzyme techniques allows keratin-specific staining to be achieved in less than 90 minutes on Mohs cryostat sections.

Seventy of 74 (95%) of the recurring tumors and 62 of 74 (84%) of the nonrecurring tumors were human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid positive. The rates of positivity of types 16 and 18 were 64% versus 31% in the recurrers and 65% versus 14% in the nonrecurrers. Human papillomavirus type 18 positivity was associated with a greater risk of recurrence than was type 16 positivity (hazard ratio 1.8; p = 0.03). Clinical stage, nodal metastasis, and young age (< or = 35 years) also had adverse effects on relapse (hazard ratio for each approximately 2).

At comparable doses, valproate had no clear effect on any rhythm variable tested. None of these drugs consistently altered the phase of light-synchronized running rhythms or the period of the rhythm in constant darkness.

Findings at MR imaging and topographic parameters of each wrist studied were correlated with the subject's age. Any vertical or horizontal high-intensity slits that reached the joint surface or evidence of a perforation was considered abnormal. Abnormally high TFC signal intensity was seen on images of 35 (50%) wrists. Further, a thin TFC was more often seen in subjects with positive variance, and positive ulnar variance and thin TFC were associated with high signal intensity.

7503184,"Clinical indications for hysterectomy route: patient characteristics or physician preference?. Our purpose was to compare the indications, characteristics, surgical management, and outcomes of patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy, total vaginal hysterectomy, and laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy and to assess whether patients who underwent abdominal hysterectomy might have been candidates for laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy and whether patients who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy or laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy might have been candidates for total vaginal hysterectomy. The hospital charts of 502 women who underwent elective inpatient hysterectomy at a single large general hospital between January 1992 and November 1993 were abstracted retrospectively by use of a structured data abstraction instrument. The study included patients operated on by 16 different experienced gynecologists. Data were collected regarding patient demographic characteristics, clinical history and preoperative physical examination, indications for surgery, route of hysterectomy, intraoperative findings, pathologic study results, and outcomes in the immediate postoperative hospitalization period. Patient age, race, weight, parity, and previous surgical history were significantly associated with hysterectomy type. Although no nulliparous patients and no patients with a uterine size estimated preoperatively to be > 12 weeks of gestation underwent total vaginal hysterectomy, 16.6% and 30.6% of laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy patients had these characteristics, respectively. A total of 6.6% of total abdominal hysterectomy cases and 16.7% of laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy cases lacked an obvious justification for an abdominal procedure. On average, surgical time was 23 minutes longer for laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy than for total abdominal hysterectomy and 30 minutes longer for total abdominal hysterectomy than for total vaginal hysterectomy. When uterine size or configuration impaired access to uterine vessels, laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy was difficult to perform. Postoperative morbidity was similar across the three procedures, but average length of hospital stay was 2.8 days, 3.5 days, and 4.4 days for laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy, total vaginal hysterectomy, and total abdominal hysterectomy, respectively. Although there are some consistent and statistically significant differences in the characteristics of patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy versus laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy versus total vaginal hysterectomy, laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy is enabling many patients to avoid total abdominal hysterectomy. However, many patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy and laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy could probably undergo total vaginal hysterectomy instead. Clinical outcomes were similar regardless of type of hysterectomy performed. Practice style and personal preference of the surgeon thus may be playing a significant role in selection of hysterectomy type.

Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of C-terminal deletion mutants of the HIV-1 Rev protein, Rev M9 delta 14 (missing aa 68-112) and Rev M11 delta 14 (lacking aa 92-112), indicated that Rev contains 46-49 residues in alpha-helical conformation within the N-terminal 71 or 95 amino acids of the 116 residue protein. Complexation with a 40-nucleotide fragment of the Rev responsive element, RRE, (G39 to C78), containing the minimal element for Rev binding, induced an A to B form structural transition in the RRE fragment, whereas the percentage of alpha-helical conformation in the protein stays constant on substrate binding. When complexed to the RNA, neither mutant protein showed structural changes upon raising the temperature to 40 degrees C, as determined by the lack of decrease of the signal intensity at 222 nm, indicative for alpha-helical conformation. In contrast, Rev M9 delta 14, which is shorter than Rev M11 delta 14 by 24 amino acids, in the absence of RNA, lost about 60% of the spectral minima at 222 nm at the same temperature.

The progressive deposition of the beta-amyloid peptide in the brain and its microvasculature is an invariant feature of Alzheimer's disease that appears to precede the onset of dementia by many years. It had been assumed that the proteolytic release of beta-amyloid peptide from the transmembrane region of its large precursor protein was an aberrant event, requiring prior membrane injury. However, it has recently been shown that beta-amyloid peptide is continuously secreted from healthy neural and non-neural cells in culture and circulates in human CSF and blood.

7504015,"cDNA cloning and expression of guinea pig neutrophil attractant protein-1 (NAP-1). NAP-1 is highly conserved in guinea pig. cDNA for neutrophil attractant protein-1 (NAP-1, also known as IL-8) was cloned from Con A-stimulated guinea pig spleen cells with human NAP-1 cDNA as a probe. Guinea pig NAP-1 cDNA is composed of 1433 bp with an open reading frame which encodes for a 101-amino-acid protein. Guinea pig NAP-1 had 70% amino acid sequence similarity to human NAP-1, which was much higher than a similarity between human and guinea pig monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (56%). Nucleotide sequence similarity within the coding region was 75%. To confirm its biological activity in guinea pig, recombinant guinea pig NAP-1 was expressed in COS-7 cells then purified. N-terminal sequence analysis gave two different N-termini at position 23 (Met) or 24 (Val). The two proteins showed their peak activity for guinea pig neutrophils at the concentration of 1 microgram/ml (10-7 M). Despite its high similarity to human NAP-1, the responsiveness of human neutrophils to guinea pig NAP-1 was minimum. Recombinant guinea pig NAP-1 caused strong neutrophil infiltration after intradermal injection into guinea pig skin. Since guinea pig is classified as a rodent, it was of interest to know whether human NAP-1 cDNA hybridizes to genomic DNA of other rodents such as mouse or rat, in which a NAP-1 homologue has not been found. Under low stringency conditions, human NAP-1 cDNA hybridized to human, rabbit, and guinea pig DNA, but not to mouse or rat DNA. Unlike NAP-1, human MCP-1 cDNA hybridized to genomic DNA of rabbit, guinea pig, mouse, and rat; MCP-1 cDNA have been cloned from these species.

7491938,"Regulation of Ca(2+)-conducting currents in parathyroid cells by extracellular Ca(2+) and channel blockers. High extracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]o) produce sustained intracellular Ca2+ responses in parathyroid cells that correlate with suppression of parathyroid hormone release. Using whole cell patch clamping, we identified two types of Ca(2+)-conducting currents in these cells. Type 1 currents were enhanced by raising [Ca2+]o and blocked by Cd2+ and nifedipine, whereas type 2 currents were resistant to blockade by these agents. Both types of membrane currents were cation nonselective, voltage independent over a broad range of membrane potentials, and blocked by the trivalent ions La3+ and Gd3+ (> 98%). Cd2+, La3+, and Gd3+ had biphasic effects on membrane conductance (Gm). At submicromolar concentrations, these ions increased Gm, whereas at higher concentrations they reduced Gm. In contrast to ionic channel blockers, nifedipine had only an inhibitory effect on the Ca(2+)-conducting currents that were sensitive to changes in [Ca2+]o (dose inhibiting 50% of maximal response = approximately 3-10 x 10(-8) M). Microfluorimetric ratio-imaging analysis of single parathyroid cells loaded with fura 2 showed that Gd3+ inhibited sustained intracellular Ca2+ responses to high [Ca2+]o.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is becoming increasingly used to detect chromosomal changes in cancer cytogenetics. Here, we report its use in human HL60 cells to detect aneuploidy induced by the benzene metabolite, 1,2,4-benzenetriol (BT). Human centromeric probes specific for chromosomes 9 and 7 were used. Untreated HL60 cells were 0.72 +/- 0.29% hyperdiploid for chromosome 9. Treatment with 5 microM BT increased this level 3-fold to 2.20 +/- 0.87% and 50 microM increased it 4-fold to 2.96 +/- 0.74%. Similar results were obtained with the chromosome 7 probe. The induction of aneuploidy by BT is therefore not chromosome-specific nor is it artifactual. Immunocytochemical staining with anti-tubulin antibodies also showed that BT disrupted microtubule organization at these concentrations. Thus, mitotic spindle disruption probably plays an important role in BT-induced aneuploidy. Trisomy and not tetrasomy accounted for the majority of the hyperdiploidy induced by BT in the two C-group chromosomes 7 and 9.

Myocarditis was accompanied by pericarditis in six patients and by both endocarditis and pericarditis in one patient. These signs of inflammation were resolved by stage III in all but three patients with electrocardiographic abnormalities.

7476918,"Molecular cloning and expression of multiple isoforms of human prostaglandin E receptor EP3 subtype generated by alternative messenger RNA splicing: multiple second messenger systems and tissue-specific distributions. Five distinct cDNA clones encoding four different isoforms of human prostaglandin (PG) E receptor EP3 subtype were isolated from a human kidney cDNA library. Two cDNA clones differed only in their 3'-untranslated regions. The four isoforms, tentatively named EP3-I, EP3-II, EP3-III, and EP3-IV, which were generated by alternative mRNA splicing, had identical amino acid sequences except for their different carboxyl-terminal tails. Transfection experiments revealed that all the four isoforms show high binding affinities to PGE2, PGE1, and M&B28767, an EP3-specific agonist, whereas their downstream signaling pathways are divergent. M&B28767 increased cAMP concentrations in cells expressing EP3-II and EP3-IV, whereas it inhibited forskolin-induced cAMP accumulations in cells expressing all EP3 isoforms. M&B28767 also stimulated phosphoinositide turnover in cells expressing EP3-I and EP3-II. Northern blot analysis revealed that the EP3 gene is expressed in a wide variety of human tissues. The human EP3 mRNA was present most abundantly in the kidney, pancreas, and uterus.

We report that interleukin-1 (IL-1) regulates the levels of WAF1 protein and mRNA in human fibroblasts. Further studies showed that 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) enhanced the accumulation of WAF1; cells refractory to TPA still increased their levels of WAF1 mRNA when exposed to IL-1.

7488080,"Adaptation to phosphate depletion in opossum kidney cells. Dietary phosphate restriction produces an adaptive increase in renal tubular Na/Pi cotransport. A similar adaptation occurs during phosphate depletion in opossum kidney cells, a continuous line of cultured renal epithelial cells. We investigated the cellular changes associated with adaptation to phosphate depletion in OK cells, in isolation from the complex systemic changes that occur with in vivo phosphate restriction. Phosphate depletion for up to 24 hours was associated with increases in Na/Pi cotransport activity, Na/Pi cotransporter mRNA, and Na/Pi cotransporter protein. Moreover, the increases in Na/Pi cotransport, and Na/Pi cotransporter mRNA and protein occurred at physiologically relevant degrees of phosphate restriction. The experimental results suggest that increases in Na/Pi cotransporter mRNA and protein may mediate the increase in Na/Pi cotransport activity in OK cells during phosphate depletion.",Epigenetics,adaptation phosphate depletion opossum kidney cell dietary phosphate restriction produce adaptive increase renal tubular napi cotransport similar adaptation occurs phosphate depletion opossum kidney cell continuous line cultured renal epithelial cell investigated cellular change associated adaptation phosphate depletion ok cell isolation complex systemic change occur vivo phosphate restriction phosphate depletion hour associated increase napi cotransport activity napi cotransporter mrna napi cotransporter protein moreover increase napi cotransport napi cotransporter mrna protein occurred physiologically relevant degree phosphate restriction experimental result suggest increase napi cotransporter mrna protein may mediate increase napi cotransport activity ok cell phosphate depletion
7487188,"Attitudes of dialysis patients and caregivers regarding advance directives. The objective of this study was to describe and compare the attitudes of dialysis patients, their relatives/friends, primary nephrologists, and nurses regarding advance directives. A descriptive comparative design was used. A total of 50 dialysis patients from a large teaching hospital in western Canada participated in the study. For every patient who responded, a relative/friend, physician, and nurse completed the questionnaire. The questionnaires were designed for the purposes of the study. These questionnaires were mailed to dialysis patients, who were asked to identify a relative/friend to complete a similar questionnaire. Nurses and physicians also completed questionnaires. Overall, 84% of patients indicated that they believed that it was important to leave a living will, but only 18% of these patients had actually left an advance directive. However, 52% of patients and relatives/friends believed that major treatment decisions should be left to the physician, a perception that was not shared by physicians and nurses. It appears that patients, family/friends, nurses, and physicians in this study had differing perceptions regarding advance directives.

7480426,"The Psychogeriatric Assessment Scales: a multi-dimensional alternative to categorical diagnoses of dementia and depression in the elderly. The Psychogeriatric Assessment Scales (PAS) provide an assessment of the clinical changes seen in dementia and depression. Principal components analysis and latent trait analysis were used to develop a set of scales to summarize these clinical changes. There are three scales derived from an interview with the subject (Cognitive Impairment, Depression, Stroke) and three from an interview with an informant (Cognitive Decline, Behaviour Change, Stroke). Results are reported on the reliability and validity of these scales using data from clinical samples in Sydney and Geneva and a population sample from Canberra. The scales were found to have excellent validity when judged against clinical diagnoses of dementia and depression and could distinguish Alzheimer's from vascular dementia. Cut-off points were developed to indicate correspondence between scale scores and clinical diagnoses. Percentile rank norms were developed from the Canberra population sample.

The author showed the practical significance and expediency of performing reconstructive-plastic operations (57 patients) in surgical correction of severe pathology of the urinary tract. The indications for plastic operations were stenoses of various etiology, intraoperative traumas of the urinary tract, contracted bladder and the consequent ureterohydronephrosis, renal insufficiency. The choice of the tactics and method of surgical treatment should be strictly substantiated and based on the individual features of the urinary system pathology, the character of the intraoperative trauma of the ureter and bladder and its possible after-effect on the kidney. Taking into account the variability of the pathology and the length of the cicatricial narrowing of the pelvic-ureteral segment and ureter, and the degree of kidney constriction, variations of plastic operations differing in the complexity of the techniques were applied. These were small in volume flap plastics of the pelvic-ureteral segment and ureter (Calp-de-Virda, Baori, Demela) and intestinal plastics of the bladder in one of the modifications. The possibility of plastic operations in restoration of physiological urination and social rehabilitation of patients with urinary fistulas was determined.

7473835,"Effect of beta-carotene supplementation on indices of colonic cell proliferation. Epidemiologic studies have shown that consuming foods containing beta-carotene is associated with a decreased incidence of colon cancer. The validity of this association has recently been questioned. It is not known if the rate of colonic cell proliferation differs among individuals with or without a history of colonic polyps or cancer and if proliferation changes in response to beta-carotene. This study was intended to (a) determine whether differences exist in colonic cell proliferation in individuals with and without prior colonic polyps or tumors, (b) demonstrate that beta-carotene accumulates in colonic mucosa following dietary supplementation, and (c) determine whether mucosal beta-carotene accumulation influences colonic cell proliferation. Subjects were enrolled in the phase I study from June 1991 until February 1994. The participants included 20 individuals (11 males and nine females, aged 62.3 +/- 8.9 years [means +/- SD]) with normal colons (as judged by recent colonoscopy), 40 (24 males and 16 females, aged 59.6 +/- 10.1 years) with a history of colonic polyp(s), and 41 (30 males and 11 females, aged 67.2 +/- 9.7 years) with prior colon cancer. The subjects in the last two groups consumed either 30 mg of beta-carotene or placebo each morning for 3 months. This dose of beta-carotene has no known toxic effects, but it can increase the serum level by approximately 10-fold. beta-carotene concentration in serum and colonic tissue was quantitated by high-pressure liquid chromatography in samples collected before and after supplementation with beta-carotene or placebo. Cellular proliferation was assessed on the basis of tissue ornithine decarboxylase activity, urinary polyamine excretion, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression. The differences in colonic cell proliferation parameters due to beta-carotene supplementation, within and among different groups, were evaluated by the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed ranked test and the Mann-Whitney test, respectively. All statistical tests were two-sided. Colonic cell proliferation did not differ in samples obtained from individuals with and without prior colonic polyp(s) or cancer. beta-carotene concentrations in serum and colonic tissue were significantly increased in groups receiving beta-carotene (P < .001). However, cell proliferation did not differ, as judged by any of the three measures, among samples from all experimental groups collected before and after supplementation with beta-carotene. Dietary supplementation with beta-carotene for a period of 3 months does not alter colonic cell proliferation in individuals with a history of colonic polyps or cancer. The mechanism by which beta-carotene might reduce colon cancer incidence does not appear to involve or result in a change in cell proliferation in the normal colonic mucosa as studied in individuals with a history of colonic polyps or cancer.",Epigenetics,effect betacarotene supplementation index colonic cell proliferation epidemiologic study shown consuming food containing betacarotene associated decreased incidence colon cancer validity association recently questioned known rate colonic cell proliferation differs among individual without history colonic polyp cancer proliferation change response betacarotene study intended determine whether difference exist colonic cell proliferation individual without prior colonic polyp tumor demonstrate betacarotene accumulates colonic mucosa following dietary supplementation determine whether mucosal betacarotene accumulation influence colonic cell proliferation subject enrolled phase study june february participant included individual male nine female aged year mean sd normal colon judged recent colonoscopy male female aged year history colonic polyp male female aged year prior colon cancer subject last two group consumed either mg betacarotene placebo morning month dose betacarotene known toxic effect increase serum level approximately fold betacarotene concentration serum colonic tissue quantitated highpressure liquid chromatography sample collected supplementation betacarotene placebo cellular proliferation assessed basis tissue ornithine decarboxylase activity urinary polyamine excretion proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression difference colonic cell proliferation parameter due betacarotene supplementation within among different group evaluated wilcoxon matchedpairs signed ranked test mannwhitney test respectively statistical test twosided colonic cell proliferation differ sample obtained individual without prior colonic polyp cancer betacarotene concentration serum colonic tissue significantly increased group receiving betacarotene however cell proliferation differ judged three measure among sample experimental group collected supplementation betacarotene dietary supplementation betacarotene period month alter colonic cell proliferation individual history colonic polyp cancer mechanism betacarotene might reduce colon cancer incidence appear involve result change cell proliferation normal colonic mucosa studied individual history colonic polyp cancer

We have characterized the estrous cycle by obtaining vaginal smears, and quantitating estradiol (E), progesterone (P), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) plasma levels at different phases of the estrous cycle in Lewis (LEW/N) and Fischer (F344/N) rats. Comparison of the duration of the component phases of estrous showed LEW/N metestrous to be significantly longer than in F344/N rats while diestrous and estrous were significantly shorter; proestrous was identical. E levels in LEW/N rats were significantly greater than in F344/N rats only in the estrous phase of the cycle. P levels were significantly greater in LEW/N rats in all phases. LH and FSH levels in the two strains did not differ. Elevated E and P levels would be expected to be associated with increased corticosterone through inhibition of the glucocorticoid negative-feedback pathway.

7479290,"Dissociated feeding and hypothermic effects of neuropeptide Y in the paraventricular and perifornical hypothalamus. The present study investigated the effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) on food intake and body temperature (Tbo) in free-feeding unrestrained rats following injection into the medial hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) or the lateral perifornical hypothalamus (PFH). NPY (78-235 pmol) or saline was infused unilaterally into the PVN or PFH in a volume of 0.4 microliter and simultaneous measures of food intake and Tbo were taken every 30 min for 3 h. Results indicated that NPY evoked changes in eating behavior and Tbo that were dependent upon the site of hypothalamic injection. Although PVN and PFH administration of NPY both increased food intake dose dependently within 30 min of treatment, PFH NPY-injected rats (n = 9) showed a stronger behavioral response compared to rats (n = 9) receiving NPY injections into the PVN. In PVN-treated rats, however, the increased eating was associated with a significant decline in Tbo evident within the first 30-min test interval. A mean maximal decline of 0.92 +/- 0.26 degree C occurred within 90 min of PVN treatment of the highest dose, which produced a reduction in Tbo that was maintained for 2.5 h. In contrast, NPY infusion into the PFH failed to reliably alter Tbo at any of the doses tested. These findings are consistent with evidence that NPY in the PVN and PFH may have distinct functions and suggest that although PFH NPY acts to stimulate a robust and relatively specific ingestive response, PVN NPY may participate in the complex integrative mechanisms responsible for the simultaneous regulation of feeding, thermoregulatory, and metabolic processes.",Epigenetics,dissociated feeding hypothermic effect neuropeptide paraventricular perifornical hypothalamus present study investigated effect neuropeptide npy food intake body temperature tbo freefeeding unrestrained rat following injection medial hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus pvn lateral perifornical hypothalamus pfh npy pmol saline infused unilaterally pvn pfh volume microliter simultaneous measure food intake tbo taken every min result indicated npy evoked change eating behavior tbo dependent upon site hypothalamic injection although pvn pfh administration npy increased food intake dose dependently within min treatment pfh npyinjected rat showed stronger behavioral response compared rat receiving npy injection pvn pvntreated rat however increased eating associated significant decline tbo evident within first min test interval mean maximal decline degree occurred within min pvn treatment highest dose produced reduction tbo maintained contrast npy infusion pfh failed reliably alter tbo dos tested finding consistent evidence npy pvn pfh may distinct function suggest although pfh npy act stimulate robust relatively specific ingestive response pvn npy may participate complex integrative mechanism responsible simultaneous regulation feeding thermoregulatory metabolic process

Our previous studies of anti-DNA antibodies in SLE have demonstrated a preferential use of V kappa I and V lambda II gene families to encode light chains of antibodies that express the anti-DNA-associated 3I and 8.12 idiotypes, respectively. In this study, we employed PCR to obtain V kappa I and V lambda II germline genes from lupus patients in order to compare the germline genes to genes encoding expressed V kappa I and V lambda II light chains and to analyze the extent of somatic mutation among autoantibodies that derive from these light chain families. Our analysis shows that the germline repertoire among all persons (autoimmune and healthy) is comparable and that somatic mutation is used to diversify autoantibodies as well as anti-microbial antibodies. We have observed that autoantibodies encoded by V kappa I and V lambda II genes have a higher number of amino acid replacements in CDRs than autoantibodies encoded by other VL gene families.

The plasma tripeptide glycyl-L-lysine (GHL), when added at nanomolar concentrations to a wide group of cultured systems, produces a disparate set of responses ranging from the stimulation of growth and differentiation to outright toxicity. Such diverse actions imply that this tripeptide mediates some basic biochemical function common to many types of cells and organisms. During the isolation of GHL we found the compound to co-isolate through a number of steps with approximately equimolar copper and about 1/5 molar iron. Maximal effects on hepatoma cells (HTC4) were seen when the peptide was added with copper and iron to the growth medium. Structure-function studies revealed that several tripeptides with a histidyl-lysyl linkage were nearly as active as GHL. The association of GHL with copper and a homology similarity between the tripeptide and the copper transport sites on albumin and alpha-fetoprotein, where the cupric atom is bound to a histidyl residue adjacent to a basic residue, suggested that GHL may act as a copper transport factor.

7480233,"Evidence for the efficacy of TRAM flap delay in a rat model. The dilemma in selecting a variant of the transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap for autogenous tissue breast reconstruction is to balance maximal flap perfusion against the sacrifice of abdominal-wall integrity. A surgical delay has been suggested as one very simple fascia-sparing technique that simultaneously augments flap volume, but no randomized clinical studies have been performed to prove whether there is any benefit whatsoever following such a maneuver. Because large groups of nearly identical subjects may be more readily available for comparison in an animal model, the rat TRAM flap provides an inexpensive method to further investigate the delay phenomenon in this setting. Staged procedures were performed in 15 Sprague-Dawley rats initially causing a delay by division of one or both dominant vessels (cranial epigastric) supplying the rectus abdominis muscles. Either 2 or 4 weeks later, TRAM flaps were elevated based only on the subservient (caudal epigastric) pedicle. A control group of 7 rats with immediate formation of a TRAM flap had a mean survival of 46.3 +/- 15.37 percent of their original flap surface area. After a 2-week delay, viability was 50.2 +/- 17.54 percent for ipsilateral and 39.4 +/- 7.57 percent for flaps with prior bilateral dominant pedicle division. Neither was significantly different from control (p = 0.68 and 0.38, respectively).

7476138,"Maximum-likelihood estimation of molecular haplotype frequencies in a diploid population. Molecular techniques allow the survey of a large number of linked polymorphic loci in random samples from diploid populations. However, the gametic phase of haplotypes is usually unknown when diploid individuals are heterozygous at more than one locus. To overcome this difficulty, we implement an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm leading to maximum-likelihood estimates of molecular haplotype frequencies under the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg proportions. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated for simulated data representing both DNA sequences and highly polymorphic loci with different levels of recombination. As expected, the EM algorithm is found to perform best for large samples, regardless of recombination rates among loci. To ensure finding the global maximum likelihood estimate, the EM algorithm should be started from several initial conditions. The present approach appears to be useful for the analysis of nuclear DNA sequences or highly variable loci. Although the algorithm, in principle, can accommodate an arbitrary number of loci, there are practical limitations because the computing time grows exponentially with the number of polymorphic loci.

Failure to obtain symptomatic relief after scalenotomy alone [8] caused us to abandon this treatment. The advantages of the subclavicular approach to first rib resection are as follows: (1) The operation is easy and fast. (2) There is good visibility in the operative field.

The hepatic tumor cell line (HTC) was tested for the ability to produce sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in response to chemical carcinogens which require activation. Without the addition of exogenous microsomal enzyme preparations, cyclophosphamide, N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) induced significant levels of SCEs in these cells. Mitomycin C (MMC) and ultraviolet light, which do not require activation, also produced significant levels of SCEs. The induction of SCEs in HTC cells by AFB1 was shown to be inhibited by estradiol, a known inhibitor of microsomal activating enzymes. For the carcinogens tested, the HTC cell SCE assay was quite sensitive and comparable to other mammalian test systems. Exceptional sensitivity was found in the case of AFB1.

A six component load transducer was incorporated in each of the two fixtures representing a water tap and a jar cap 70mm in diameter and the maximal loading on the fingers was monitered in applying an isometric twisting moment to these structures. Two different hand configurations were studied for each activity: the spatial position and orientation of the finger segments were determined using two orthogonally positioned still cameras, and specially designed stick markers were utilized to highlight anatomical landmarks. The results confirm the use of the finger in a complex three-dimensional manner with no significant differences between the male and female subjects.

Examples from quantitative laboratory studies on carcinogenic risk factors are discussed to illustrate research approaches in this field, especially in measurements of carcinogen interactions with animal and human target tissues, in human tissue-mediated mutagenesis of mammalian cells, and in studies of combined effects of different carcinogens. The scientific criteria for the quantitative estimation of carcinogenic risk, developed by the Interagency Regulatory Liaison Group, are reviewed, and related research needs are indicated. The implications for regulatory policy, as outlined by the U.S. Regulatory Council, are discussed.

7463168,"Long-term effects of level of protein intake on calcium metabolism in young adult women. The long-term effect of level of protein intake on calcium metabolism, renal function and renal acid excretion was determined during a 75-day metabolic study. Six women consumed a diet containing either 46 or 123 g protein for 60 days; they then consumed the alternate diet for 15 days. Calcium, phosphorus and magnesium intakes were maintained constant at 500, 900 and 350 mg, respectively, throughout the 75-day study. Urinary calcium was remarkably constant with time at both levels of protein intake but was approximately twice as high when the 123 g protein diet was consumed. Level of protein intake had no effect on calcium absorption; the increase in urinary calcium found when the high protein diet was given, therefore, caused a markedly negative calcium balance. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal acid excretion were higher and fractional renal tubular reabsorption of calcium was lower when the high protein diet was given. The hypercalciuria caused by the high protein intake was due primarily to the decrease in fractional tubular reabsorption of calcium and, to a lesser extent, to the increase in GFR. Neither GFR, fractional renal tubular reabsorption of calcium nor any of the components of renal acid excretion exhibited any tendency to change with time over the 60-day experimental period.",Epigenetics,longterm effect level protein intake calcium metabolism young adult woman longterm effect level protein intake calcium metabolism renal function renal acid excretion determined day metabolic study six woman consumed diet containing either protein day consumed alternate diet day calcium phosphorus magnesium intake maintained constant mg respectively throughout day study urinary calcium remarkably constant time level protein intake approximately twice high protein diet consumed level protein intake effect calcium absorption increase urinary calcium found high protein diet given therefore caused markedly negative calcium balance glomerular filtration rate gfr renal acid excretion higher fractional renal tubular reabsorption calcium lower high protein diet given hypercalciuria caused high protein intake due primarily decrease fractional tubular reabsorption calcium lesser extent increase gfr neither gfr fractional renal tubular reabsorption calcium component renal acid excretion exhibited tendency change time day experimental period
7459852,"Measurement of benzo(a)pyrene-DNA adducts by enzyme immunoassays and radioimmunoassay. Ultrasensitive enzymatic radioimmunoassay (USERIA) was compared to radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in determining the amount of benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P] metabolite covalently bound to guanine in DNA. In the USERIA approach, DNA either with or without B(a)P metabolite modification was adsorbed on the wells of microtiter plates, and rabbit antiserum to B(a)P metabolite-modified DNA [B(a)P-DNA] was then added. Antibodies reacted specifically with the B(a)P-DNA attached to the surface of the plate. After reaction between goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and rabbit IgG bound to the solid phase, this specific antigen-antibody reaction was enzymatically amplified by alkaline phosphatase conversion of [3H]adenosine 5'-monophosphate to [3H]adenosine. Following chromatographic separation from [3H]adenosine5'-monophosphate, [3H]adenosine was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The amount of [3H]-adenosine formed was linearly related to the amount of B(a)P-DNA in 10 ng DNA attached to the solid phase. As little as 3 fmol of bound B(a)P metabolite can be detected by noncompetitive USERIA, while 10 fmol of the adducts in 25 microgram DNA [1 B(a)P-DNA adduct per 7 X 10(6) nucleotides] can be measured by the competitive USERIA approach. Under our standard competitive procedure with 1 microgram DNA in the antigen-antibody reaction mixture, USERIA is approximately 500-fold more sensitive than radioimmunoassay and 5-fold more sensitive than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of B(a)P-DNA adducts.

7430097,"Uptake and metabolism of fatty acids by dispersed adult rat heart myocytes. I. Kinetics of homologous fatty acids. An adult rat heart myocyte preparation was used to study the uptake and metabolism of the 1-(14)C-labeled free fatty acids decanoate, laurate, myristate, palmitate, and oleate at 37 degrees C in the absence of serum albumin. The rate of total uptake consisted of both a nonsaturable and a saturable component. The nonsaturable component corresponded to the fatty acid accumulating in the free fatty acid fraction, and the rate of this accumulation increased logarithmically as a function of chain length. The saturable component corresponded to that portion of fatty acid converted to the only detectable metabolic products: CO2, triglyceride, and polar lipid. The Km for this process was about 1 microM and was independent of chain length. The Vmax for the saturable component varied only slightly with chain length, from 20 +/- 1 nmol/h-mg of cell protein for decanoate to 47 +/- 18 nmol/h-mg of cell protein for palmitate. The relative product distribution did vary with chain length, however, ranging from primarily carbon dioxide for decanoate to approximately equal quantities of carbon dioxide, triglyceride, and polar lipid for palmitate. Two internal pools of free fatty acid are postulated: a minor pool that equilibrates rapidly with external fatty acid and serves as the precursor for fatty acid activation, and a major pool containing most of the accumulated free acid. These two pools are interconvertible. The data support a simple diffusion or membrane-partitioning process for the accumulation of fatty acid in the second pool. The data presented in this paper are not sufficient to distinguish between a simple diffusion or a carrier-mediated process for uptake into the first pool. The saturation kinetics observed appear to represent a metabolic step such as fatty acid activation, rather than a transport carrier. Evidence of toxicity at a higher concentration of the longer chain fatty acids limits the concentration range that can be studied in the absence of albumin. Decanoate did not appear to be toxic at concentrations up to 300 microM, but laurate at 10 microM and myristate at 5 microM appeared to uncouple respiratory control.",Epigenetics,uptake metabolism fatty acid dispersed adult rat heart myocytes kinetics homologous fatty acid adult rat heart myocyte preparation used study uptake metabolism clabeled free fatty acid decanoate laurate myristate palmitate oleate degree absence serum albumin rate total uptake consisted nonsaturable saturable component nonsaturable component corresponded fatty acid accumulating free fatty acid fraction rate accumulation increased logarithmically function chain length saturable component corresponded portion fatty acid converted detectable metabolic product co triglyceride polar lipid km process microm independent chain length vmax saturable component varied slightly chain length nmolhmg cell protein decanoate nmolhmg cell protein palmitate relative product distribution vary chain length however ranging primarily carbon dioxide decanoate approximately equal quantity carbon dioxide triglyceride polar lipid palmitate two internal pool free fatty acid postulated minor pool equilibrates rapidly external fatty acid serf precursor fatty acid activation major pool containing accumulated free acid two pool interconvertible data support simple diffusion membranepartitioning process accumulation fatty acid second pool data presented paper sufficient distinguish simple diffusion carriermediated process uptake first pool saturation kinetics observed appear represent metabolic step fatty acid activation rather transport carrier evidence toxicity higher concentration longer chain fatty acid limit concentration range studied absence albumin decanoate appear toxic concentration microm laurate microm myristate microm appeared uncouple respiratory control
7470228,"Stimulation of renal magnesium reabsorption by calcitonin in the rat. The effect of salmon synthetic calcitonin (CT) on the renal excretion of water and electrolytes was investigated in thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX) nondiuretic rats. CT did not significantly alter the excretion of either H2O, Na, Ca, phosphate (P), or K, but consistently decreased both fractional and absolute excretion rates of Mg. This latter effect was probably the result of enhanced reabsorption by the loop of Henle. The excretion rates of P and K were either increased or decreased by CT administration; the Mg response on both the whole kidney and loop of Henle was always observed, however, irrespective of the P and K response. In other experiments, the decrease in Mg excretion was still observed when the fall in the filtered load of P and Ca secondary to CT administration was prevented by an appropriate infusion of Ca and P. It is concluded that 1) CT can alter K and P excretion rates but this influence can be prevented by maintaining the filtered load of Ca and P constant, and 2) CT exerts a marked stimulatory effect on Mg reabsorption, presumably by enhancing reabsorption by the thick ascending limb.",Epigenetics,stimulation renal magnesium reabsorption calcitonin rat effect salmon synthetic calcitonin ct renal excretion water electrolyte investigated thyroparathyroidectomized tptx nondiuretic rat ct significantly alter excretion either ho na ca phosphate consistently decreased fractional absolute excretion rate mg latter effect probably result enhanced reabsorption loop henle excretion rate either increased decreased ct administration mg response whole kidney loop henle always observed however irrespective response experiment decrease mg excretion still observed fall filtered load ca secondary ct administration prevented appropriate infusion ca concluded ct alter excretion rate influence prevented maintaining filtered load ca constant ct exerts marked stimulatory effect mg reabsorption presumably enhancing reabsorption thick ascending limb

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) and nitric oxide (NO) mediate in part the microbicidal response of murine and rodent alveolar macrophages (AM) and recruited neutrophils (PMN) to airborne infections. Ethanol (ETOH) suppresses intrapulmonary TNF alpha and NO release and impairs pulmonary host defense mechanisms. We tested the concept that ETOH down-regulates NO by inhibiting production of TNF alpha. Male rats were given intratracheal (i.t.) saline (PBS), a polyclonal anti-TNF alpha antibody (TNFab) or nonimmune IgG (22 mg/kg, i.m.) 2 h before giving i.t. Escherichia coli endotoxin (LPS) to normal rats or rats pretreated with ETOM (5.5 g/kg, i.p.) 30 min before experimentation. AM and PMN were obtained from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) fluid of rats killed 2 and 4 h after administration of LPS. mRNA for inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and TNF alpha were measured in AM and PMN with competitor equalized RT-PCR techniques. The BAL fluid, AM, and PMN were assayed for TNF alpha and NO2-, and NO3- (RNI) with the L929 bioassay and chemiluminescence, respectively. TNFab abolished LPS-induced increases in TNF alpha but did not suppress the NO content of the BAL fluid or gene expression for iNOS by AM or PMN. ETOH suppressed LPS-induced increases in mRNA for iNOS, production of RNI, and BAL fluid TNF alpha but did not affect LPS-induced increases in mRNA for TNF alpha. ETOH-induced attenuation of LPS-induced up-regulation of the iNOS system did not differ in rats pretreated with TNFab or IgG.

The mature form of human protein HC, or alpha 1-microglobulin, has been expressed in Escherichia coli. Protein HC is a member of the lipocalin superfamily of hydrophobic ligand-binding proteins, and carries a heterogeneous chromophore linked covalently by a reduction-resistant bond. Protein HC was first overexpressed as a C-LytA/HC fusion protein containing the C-terminal moiety of the pneumococcal lytic amidase (LytA). Recombinant C-LytA/HC was found to be an insoluble aggregate that was solubilized with 6 M guanidinium chloride and renatured by the addition of thiol reagents in the presence of L-arginine. Recombinant protein HC (rHC) was released from C-LytA/HC by trypsin digestion and purified by size-exclusion chromatography. rHC protein possesses an N-terminal amino-acid sequence identical to that of human protein HC, and a slightly lower molecular mass as determined by SDS-PAGE.

7523978,"NK1 and NK2 receptors are similar in man and rabbit. A series of 15-18 compounds that act on NK1 or NK2 receptors as agonists or antagonists have been tested in the monoreceptor systems of the rabbit vena cava (NK1) and the rabbit pulmonary artery (NK2) for biological activities and for their ability to displace [3H] [Sar9, Met(O2)11]SP or [125I] NKA respectively from NK1 or NK2 human binding sites obtained by transfection and functional expression of the cDNAs for these receptor subtypes in CHO-K1 cells. For the two tachykinin receptors studied, positive highly significant correlations have been shown between binding and biological assays. Slopes of correlations are linear and near unity (r = 0.918 and 0.938). For NK1 and NK2 receptors the pharmacology in human and rabbit tissues appears to be very similar.

7515848,"A murine cytomegalovirus-neutralizing monoclonal antibody exhibits autoreactivity and induces tissue damage in vivo. The autoreactivity of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) AC1 was examined in vitro and in vivo. Both mAb AC1 and a human antiserum reactive with U1-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1-snRNP) stained uninfected mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) in a speckled nuclear pattern and reacted with 70,000 molecular weight (MW) MEF nuclear antigens by immunoblotting, suggesting that mAb AC1 cross-reacted with the 70,000 MW component of U1-snRNP. However, only mAb AC1 cross-reacted with an additional epithelial cytoplasmic autoantigen present in cultured HEp2 cells. On tissue sections from uninfected mice, mAb AC1 predominantly reacted with a component of central and peripheral nervous systems, although cross-reactivity with the stratum spinosum of the skin and the outer sheath of hair follicles was also observed. Immunoblotting revealed that mAb AC1 reacted with phosphorylated epitopes present on a 98,000 MW MCMV structural protein and the 200,000 MW mouse neurofilament protein (NFP). Treatment of uninfected mice with mAb AC1 resulted in a severe interstitial pneumonia with greatly thickened and congested alveolar septa. Severe oedema of the hypodermis and a mild mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis were also observed. These results demonstrate that a mAb reacting with a MCMV structural phosphoprotein which can protect mice against the dissemination of MCMV, can also promote the development of autoimmune disease.

Based on neonatal examination at birth, it has been estimated that epileptic women have a 2-3 times greater risk of giving birth to an infant with congenital anomalies. But anticonvulsant drugs may also have more subtle influences on the developing foetus which are not visible at birth but only emerge later in life. Evidence for these functional teratogenic influences has been provided by animal research and follow-up studies in young children. This article discusses these findings in human and animal studies. In addition, the outline of a study carried out at the Department of Obstetrics and Neonatology, Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, is described.

7522498,"Influence of halothane on the effect of cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent positive inotropic agents in human myocardium. Volatile anaesthetics have a variety of effects on the myocardium, namely a negative inotropic effect and a catecholamine sensitizing effect. The present study was designed to see if the hydrocarbon anaesthetics interact specifically with subcellular targets of the myocardial cell, by examining the effects of halothane in the presence of positive inotropic agents with different mechanisms of action. Experiments were performed in isolated electrically driven left ventricular preparations (1 Hz, 37 degrees C, Ca2+ 1.8 mmol litre-1) from human hearts obtained at cardiac surgery. The concentration-response curves of noradrenaline, milrinone, BayK 8644 and Ca2+ were investigated in the absence and in the presence of halothane. Halothane enhanced the efficacy of noradrenaline and milrinone but not of Ca2+ or BayK 8644. The potency of milrinone was also increased by halothane, whereas the potency of BayK 8644 was decreased and those of noradrenaline and Ca2+ were unchanged. Halothane differentially influences the effects of agents with different positive inotropic mechanisms.

7509772,"Immunohistochemical study of hepatic fibrosis induced in rats by multiple galactosamine injections. Multiple injections of D-galactosamine induce liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in rats. The purpose of this immunopathological study was to correlate inflammation and hepatic extracellular matrix remodeling after repeated administration of galactosamine. Rats were given 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 140 intraperitoneal injections of D-galactosamine (500 mg/kg body wt, three times weekly). Controls received injections of saline solution. Cryostat sections of liver tissue obtained on biopsy or autopsy were immunostained with a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal monospecific antibodies reactive with macrophages, T and B lymphocytes, desmin, the extracellular matrix components fibronectin; laminin; collagen types I, III and IV; and the fibronectin receptor alpha 5 beta 1. Total RNA was extracted and Northern-blot analysis was performed with a specific cDNA probe for rat collagen type III. Spotty liver cell necrosis and mild portal and parenchymal inflammation was seen after 10 injections of galactosamine. After 20 to 40 injections, expansion of protal tracts, prominent bile ductular proliferation and gradual formation of fibrous septa were encountered with the development of cirrhosis at later intervals. These progressive histological changes were paralleled by a gradual increase of desmin-positive cells in developing septa with deposition of fibronectin; collagen types I, III, and IV; and laminin. Northern-blot analysis showed that this accumulation of extracellular matrix was not accompanied by increase of mRNA for collagen type III.

7506117,"Collision of transitional cell carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. An immunohistochemical study and review of the literature. A case characterized by a rare synchronous occurrence of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the renal pelvis and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the same kidney is presented. A retrospective analysis of 23 similar cases reported in the English literature over the last 71 years demonstrated a male-to-female ratio of 2:1, an average age of 64.5 years, and a left-to-right-side ratio of 3.2:1. The three most common findings at initial examination were hematuria (90%), flank pain (19%), and flank mass (14%). Moreover, 24% of patients had tumor metastases even at initial examination. Thirty-four percent of patients had bladder neoplasms, and 24% of them had a history of cigarette smoking. There is no tendency toward higher grade of malignancy or specific histologic pattern for TCC and RCC when they occur together in the same kidney. Immunohistochemical studies were used to examine TCC and RCC, with special attention paid to the site of their collision, which displayed multifocal lymphatic permeation. Both TCC and RCC were positive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and cytokeratins identified by monoclonal antibodies CAM-5.2, AE1/AE3, and MAK-6. TCC was focally positive for keratin, detectable by antibody 34 beta E12, but RCC was not. The tumor tissue infiltrating the lymphatics, which seemed to be RCC, demonstrated positive staining for EMA and keratins CAM-5.2, AE1/AE3, and MAK-6 and negative staining for keratin 34 beta E12. Interestingly, the tumor in lymphatics displayed strong staining for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) but both TCC and RCC in the vicinity were negative.

7529107,"The effect of caffeine on prostaglandin output from the guinea-pig uterus. 1. Caffeine increased the outputs of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha from the guinea-pig uterus on days 7 and 15 of the oestrous cycle. The effect on PGE2 output depended on the age of the animals and was absent in younger guinea-pigs (< 4 months). Theophylline also stimulated the outputs of PGF2 alpha and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, but not the output of PGE2, from the day 7 guinea-pig uterus. 2. The stimulatory effects of caffeine on the outputs of PGF2 alpha, PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha from the guinea-pig uterus were not prevented by lack of extracellular calcium, ryanodine or ruthenium red (both inhibitors of calcium release via the ryanodine receptor), although the increase in PGF2 alpha output tended to be slower when extracellular calcium was absent. Also, ryanodine flattened and broadened the peak of increased PGF2 alpha release. 3. The calmodulin antagonists, W-7 and trifluoperazine, had no inhibitory effect on the caffeine-stimulated increases in uterine prostaglandin output. In fact, W-7 (but not trifluoperazine) greatly potentiated the action of caffeine on uterine PGF2 alpha output, but had little or no potentiating effect on the action of caffeine on uterine PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha outputs. 4. TMB-8, an intracellular calcium antagonist, inhibited the increase in PGF2 alpha output produced by caffeine without preventing the increases in outputs of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. 5. These studies suggest that caffeine stimulates uterine PGF2 alpha synthesis and release by a mechanism dependent upon intracellular calcium, but this mechanism is not mediated by activation of any of the three well-characterized ryanodine receptors or by calmodulin.

The effect of inhibition of nitric oxide synthase on nonadrenergic, noncholinergic nerve-mediated responses in circular smooth muscle of the human esophageal body and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) was examined in vitro. Tissues were obtained from 10 patients (eight esophageal resection for cancer, two transplant donors). Muscle strips from the LES developed significant spontaneous tension (11.6 +/- 2.1 mN/mm2, N = 6) and relaxed in response to electrical stimulation. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N omega-nitro-L-arginine (NNA), at 10(-5) M, inhibited the relaxation, but had no significant effect on the spontaneous tension (13.0 +/- 2.6 mN/mm2, P = 0.07). Esophageal body strips developed little spontaneous tension, demonstrated an ""off"" contraction following the cessation of the electrical stimulus, and when contracted with 10(-5) M carbachol, relaxed during electrical stimulation. NNA (10(-5) M) inhibited the off contraction and the relaxation seen after carbachol and unmasked a prominent intrastimulus contraction. This intrastimulus contraction was enhanced by eserine and inhibited by atropine and tetrodotoxin.

7511928,"CD44 isoform expression mediated by alternative splicing: tissue-specific regulation in mice. CD44 is a widely distributed cell surface glycoprotein which shows heterogeneity in molecular expression as a result of post-translational modification as well as alternative splicing of CD44 mRNA. Functional studies have indicated that CD44 plays a role as an adhesion molecule and that different CD44-expressing cells differ in their capacities for CD44-dependent ligand binding. These observations have raised the possibility that structural modifications of CD44, including those resulting from alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms, are involved in the functional heterogeneity of CD44. To assess the expression of CD44 isoforms in the mouse, we examined CD44 cDNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Southern blotting of PCR products with a CD44 cDNA probe or with internal oligonucleotides revealed the expression in mouse tumor cell lines and normal tissues of multiple CD44 mRNA products which are larger than that observed in the absence of variable exon expression. Interestingly, different mouse tissues, including lymphoid cells, showed unique patterns of alternative CD44 mRNA in Southern blotting analysis. The use of exon-specific primers allowed detection of multiple alternatively spliced mRNA species involving expression of at least seven variable exons. Cloning and sequencing of these PCR products revealed sequence identity with recently identified genomic CD44 sequences and confirmed that the PCR products correspond to mature mRNA expressing alternatively spliced CD44 exons. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the mouse expresses multiple variably spliced CD44 isoforms and that expression is regulated in a tissue- and cell-type specific manner.",Post-translational modification,cd isoform expression mediated alternative splicing tissuespecific regulation mouse cd widely distributed cell surface glycoprotein show heterogeneity molecular expression result posttranslational modification well alternative splicing cd mrna functional study indicated cd play role adhesion molecule different cdexpressing cell differ capacity cddependent ligand binding observation raised possibility structural modification cd including resulting alternatively spliced mrna isoforms involved functional heterogeneity cd ass expression cd isoforms mouse examined cd cdna reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rtpcr southern blotting pcr product cd cdna probe internal oligonucleotides revealed expression mouse tumor cell line normal tissue multiple cd mrna product larger observed absence variable exon expression interestingly different mouse tissue including lymphoid cell showed unique pattern alternative cd mrna southern blotting analysis use exonspecific primer allowed detection multiple alternatively spliced mrna specie involving expression least seven variable exon cloning sequencing pcr product revealed sequence identity recently identified genomic cd sequence confirmed pcr product correspond mature mrna expressing alternatively spliced cd exon taken together finding demonstrate mouse express multiple variably spliced cd isoforms expression regulated tissue celltype specific manner

7497336,"An SEM examination of etched dentin and the structure of the hybrid layer. The clinical requirements of dentin bonds are that they should be non-permeable to oral fluids, seal dentinal tubules, protect the pulp, and be long lasting and durable. Dentin bonding systems that use acidic agents to remove the smear layer are currently being used. Acid conditioning not only removes the smear layer, but also demineralizes the surface of the intertubular dentin and produces intratubular demineralization and funnelling. A dentin bond is produced when hydrophillic resin monomers infiltrate the dentinal tubules and collagen of the demineralized intertubular zone, producing a hybrid layer. The use of a critical point drying technique and SEM allows a clear visualization of the structure of the hybrid layer. This study showed that currently used hydrophillic resin monomers are unable to completely infiltrate the demineralized zone, and it is speculated that this failure could contribute to microleakage and influence the long-term durability of the bond. It is also apparent that these bonds depend on the mechanical investment of collagen by the infiltrating monomer. Since none of the unfilled resins tested seem capable of completely infiltrating the demineralized collagenous zone, the degree of demineralization produced by the commercial acid concentrations in current use is questioned. More dilute acids than those available commercially are shown to reduce both the degree and depth of demineralization, and we suggest that the resultant thinner layer may lend itself to more complete resin infiltration of the collagen.",Post-translational modification,sem examination etched dentin structure hybrid layer clinical requirement dentin bond nonpermeable oral fluid seal dentinal tubule protect pulp long lasting durable dentin bonding system use acidic agent remove smear layer currently used acid conditioning remove smear layer also demineralizes surface intertubular dentin produce intratubular demineralization funnelling dentin bond produced hydrophillic resin monomer infiltrate dentinal tubule collagen demineralized intertubular zone producing hybrid layer use critical point drying technique sem allows clear visualization structure hybrid layer study showed currently used hydrophillic resin monomer unable completely infiltrate demineralized zone speculated failure contribute microleakage influence longterm durability bond also apparent bond depend mechanical investment collagen infiltrating monomer since none unfilled resin tested seem capable completely infiltrating demineralized collagenous zone degree demineralization produced commercial acid concentration current use questioned dilute acid available commercially shown reduce degree depth demineralization suggest resultant thinner layer may lend complete resin infiltration collagen

7502237,"Defining the susceptible period of developmental toxicity for the AT1-selective angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan in rats. Previous developmental and reproductive toxicity studies conducted in rats with Losartan, a potent AT1 subtype selective angiotensin II receptor antagonist, noted treatment-related effects on the pups of dams treated beyond the second trimester through lactation, as demonstrated by increases in pre- and postweaning pup deaths and decreased pup body weights [Spence et al. (1995) Teratology 51:000-000]. The studies presented here were designed to define the critical period for the induction of neonatal toxicity and to examine the effects of Losartan on kidney development when the drug is administered to the dam beyond the second trimester through lactation. In a developmental toxicity study with postweaning evaluation, pregnant rats were administered 5, 20, and 100 mg Losartan/kg/day on gestation days 6 through 15 (GD 6-15). There were no adverse effects on the F1 generation as assessed by mortality, clinical signs, weight gain, external examinations, developmental signs, behavioral tests, and gross or microscopic examination of the kidney. In a fostering/cross-fostering study, pregnant rats were administered 100 mg Losartan/kg/day on GD 15 through lactation day 20 (LD 20). Following delivery, pups from dams treated with Losartan were fostered to control dams, pups from control dams were fostered to Losartan-treated dams, and pups were also fostered to dams within the same group. Maternal exposure to Losartan during lactation increased the incidence of pup deaths on postnatal days 1-3 (PND 1-3), caused decreased pup weights on PND 7, and decreased performance in the auditory startle test in females and increased performance on the second swim maze test in males, relative to controls. Maternal exposure to Losartan during gestation was associated with decreased pup weight on PND 21 and effects observed on male performance in the swim maze test. Treatment during gestation was also associated with decreased pup cardiac weight as well as drug-induced histopathological changes of the kidneys from F1 pups, including medial hypertrophy of intracortical arterioles and dilatation of the renal pelvis. While the cardiac and renal vascular effects disappeared with time, significant renal lesions were still evident by PND 90. In a late-gestation/lactation study with renal evaluation, pregnant rats were administered 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 20, and 100 mg Losartan/kg/day on GD 15-LD 20.

7504672,"Functional characterization of beta isoforms of murine Na,K-ATPase. The adhesion molecule on glia (AMOG/beta 2), but not beta 1, promotes neurite outgrowth. We have previously provided evidence for a dual function of the adhesion molecule on glia (AMOG/beta 2), the beta 2 subunit of the murine Na,K-ATPase, both as neural recognition molecule mediating neuron-glia interactions and as functional beta subunit of the sodium pump. To analyze the functional role of AMOG/beta 2 in neurite outgrowth, AMOG/beta 2-expressing L-cells were generated by transfection and used as substrates for neurite outgrowth of cerebellar and hippocampal neurons. AMOG/beta 2-transfected L-cells led to an increase in neurite length after 6 h, which was specifically inhibited by antibodies to AMOG/beta 2 and a neuronal membrane fraction. Moreover, the extracellular domain of AMOG/beta 2 generated as a soluble recombinant protein in Chinese hamster ovary cells partially inhibited the increase in neurite outgrowth on AMOG/beta 2-transfected L-cells. L-cells transfected with the mouse beta 1 subunit had no effect on neurite extension. Our observations show for the first time differences in functional properties for different beta isoforms of the Na,K-ATPase and suggest that AMOG/beta 2 but not beta 1 is able to interact with an unknown neuronal receptor leading to increased neurite outgrowth, most likely via signal transduction.",Post-translational modification,functional characterization beta isoforms murine nakatpase adhesion molecule glia amogbeta beta promotes neurite outgrowth previously provided evidence dual function adhesion molecule glia amogbeta beta subunit murine nakatpase neural recognition molecule mediating neuronglia interaction functional beta subunit sodium pump analyze functional role amogbeta neurite outgrowth amogbeta expressing lcells generated transfection used substrate neurite outgrowth cerebellar hippocampal neuron amogbeta transfected lcells led increase neurite length specifically inhibited antibody amogbeta neuronal membrane fraction moreover extracellular domain amogbeta generated soluble recombinant protein chinese hamster ovary cell partially inhibited increase neurite outgrowth amogbeta transfected lcells lcells transfected mouse beta subunit effect neurite extension observation show first time difference functional property different beta isoforms nakatpase suggest amogbeta beta able interact unknown neuronal receptor leading increased neurite outgrowth likely via signal transduction

7503774,"Interaction of drugs with P-glycoprotein in brain capillaries. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is expressed at high levels in a variety of non-cancerous tissues such as the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) capillaries. These thin capillaries tightly regulate the movement of substrates from the circulating blood into the brain. P-gp may be involved in the exclusion of various drugs from the capillary endothelial cells, blocking their entry into the brain. However, interactions of drugs with P-gp expressed in brain capillaries remain to be characterized. We have performed photoaffinity labeling studies using [125I]arylazidoprazosin (IAAP) to evaluate the inhibitory efficiency of various compounds. Cyclosporin A (CsA) and its derivative PSC 833 (PSC) were the most effective inhibitors of IAAP binding among the drugs tested. The magnitude of inhibition was: PSC > CsA > quinidine > vinblastine > verapamil < actinomycin D > colchicine > reserpine > bilirubin > doxorubicin > progesterone. Cremophor El, the vehicle used to administer CsA and PSC intravenously, was also able to inhibit IAAP photolabeling of P-gp. Labeling experiments were also performed using a photoactivatable [3H]CsA derivative. Photolabeling of P-gp with this compound was abolished almost completely by CsA and PSC. In vivo studies were also performed by treating rats with CsA [10 mg/(kg.day) for 10 days]. Following this treatment, no alteration in the level of P-gp expression in brain capillaries was observed. These results suggest that, at the proper dosage, administration of CsA to cancer patients could help to enhance the response of brain tumors to chemotherapeutic agents without modifying the intrinsic level of P-gp expression in this tissue.",Post-translational modification,interaction drug pglycoprotein brain capillary pglycoprotein pgp expressed high level variety noncancerous tissue endothelial cell bloodbrain barrier bbb capillary thin capillary tightly regulate movement substrate circulating blood brain pgp may involved exclusion various drug capillary endothelial cell blocking entry brain however interaction drug pgp expressed brain capillary remain characterized performed photoaffinity labeling study using iarylazidoprazosin iaap evaluate inhibitory efficiency various compound cyclosporin csa derivative psc psc effective inhibitor iaap binding among drug tested magnitude inhibition psc csa quinidine vinblastine verapamil actinomycin colchicine reserpine bilirubin doxorubicin progesterone cremophor el vehicle used administer csa psc intravenously also able inhibit iaap photolabeling pgp labeling experiment also performed using photoactivatable hcsa derivative photolabeling pgp compound abolished almost completely csa psc vivo study also performed treating rat csa mgkgday day following treatment alteration level pgp expression brain capillary observed result suggest proper dosage administration csa cancer patient help enhance response brain tumor chemotherapeutic agent without modifying intrinsic level pgp expression tissue

The effect of compactin (a lovastatin analogue) on vascular smooth muscle cells was studied at the level of cell proliferation and protein kinase C. It was observed: a) an inhibition of cell proliferation by compactin at a micromolar range, which was prevented by simultaneous addition of mevalonate; b) a stimulation of DNA synthesis with a shift in the cell cycle kinetics, either in the presence or absence of fetal calf serum and c) an increase in protein kinase C activity in compactin-treated cells in the G1 phase of the cycle. This increase was similar to the one elicited by calyculin A, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases of type PP-1 and PP-2A.

The tachykinin receptor type that mediates tachykinin-induced plasma extravasation in the rat knee joint was identified by using selective antagonists as well as natural or synthetic agonists. Substance P (SP) and neurokinin (NK) A induced plasma extravasation with almost the same potency and the maximum response was obtained at 5 nmol/knee. NKB was about ten times less potent than SP or NKA. The NK1 selective agonist, [Sar9, Met(O2)11]-SP, was about ten times more potent than SP, and the NK2 selective agonist, [Nle10]-NKA4-10, was about fifty times less potent than NK1 agonist. The NK3 agonist, Senktide, was totally ineffective at 0.5-50 nmol/knee. All responses induced by SP (5 nmol/knee), NKA (5 nmol/knee), NKB (50 nmol/knee), NK1 agonist (0.5 nmol/knee) or NK2 agonist (25 nmol/knee) were significantly and profoundly inhibited by the NK1 selective antagonist, RP67580, but not by the NK2 selective antagonist, SR48968.

Three patients with acute traumatic choroidal ruptures received a retinal examination, including fluorescein and ICG angiography study. Choroidal ruptures were well localized in ICG angiograms in both early and late phases. In fluorescein angiograms, the defects were underestimated in early phases and overestimated in the later phases.

The persistence of anorexia in wasting disorders, therefore, implies a failure of this adaptive feeding response. We describe a model for the normal hypothalamic response to starvation composed of the stimulation of neuronal pathways that promote energy intake and storage coupled with the inhibition of pathways that exert opposing effects. This model provides a framework for investigating disturbances of the normal hypothalamic response to weight loss and suggests a specific mechanism by which cytokines contribute to wasting in acquired immune deficiency syndrome and other cachexic disorders.",Post-translational modification,hypothalamic response starvation implication study wasting disorder weight loss potent stimulus food intake normal individual persistence anorexia wasting disorder therefore implies failure adaptive feeding response describe model normal hypothalamic response starvation composed stimulation neuronal pathway promote energy intake storage coupled inhibition pathway exert opposing effect model provides framework investigating disturbance normal hypothalamic response weight loss suggests specific mechanism cytokine contribute wasting acquired immune deficiency syndrome cachexic disorder
7488621,"Rapid diffusion of the lipid phosphorus of phosphatidylglycerol liposomes through polycarbonate membranes is caused by the oxidation of the unsaturated fatty acids. The lipid phosphorus of phosphatidylglycerol liposomes was found to diffuse extensively, after a lag time of 1 to 2 days, through a 0.1 micron pore size polycarbonate membrane in a two compartment system. Diffusion occurred when either multilamellar or large unilamellar vesicles were studied, even if they were sedimented to eliminate any smaller particles. The lipid of liposomes prepared under sterile conditions also diffused extensively. Diffusion appeared to be related to the age of the vesicles, and could be eliminated by incorporating antioxidants into the liposomes, or by using liposomes prepared from saturated phospholipids (C14 or larger). This indicated that diffusion was caused by phospholipid oxidation, which was confirmed by HPLC analysis. Phospholipid phosphorus that diffused through a membrane appeared more polar, as indicated by its capacity to distribute into the upper phase of a two phase extraction. Phospholipid phosphorus diffusion was preceded by the complete loss of liposomes contents, indicated by the complete diffusion of encapsulated carboxyfluorescein through the membrane. Oxidation of the lipid could be prevented by inclusion of either butylated hydroxytoluene or alpha-tocopherol in the membrane. The best retention of liposomal contents was achieved when both antioxidants and cholesterol were included in the liposome preparation. The antioxidant incorporated in the liposomes remained effective in protecting the phospholipids upon storage at 4 degrees C for 2 months. The inclusion of EDTA in the suspension medium retarded the rapid oxidation, suggesting that the presence of trace amounts of heavy metal ions in the buffer catalyzed the oxidation. Phospholipid oxidation was most effectively inhibited by the presence of serum or chemically defined medium, suggesting that oxidation of liposomal lipids in a biological environment may be minimized if appropriate steps are taken.",Post-translational modification,rapid diffusion lipid phosphorus phosphatidylglycerol liposome polycarbonate membrane caused oxidation unsaturated fatty acid lipid phosphorus phosphatidylglycerol liposome found diffuse extensively lag time day micron pore size polycarbonate membrane two compartment system diffusion occurred either multilamellar large unilamellar vesicle studied even sedimented eliminate smaller particle lipid liposome prepared sterile condition also diffused extensively diffusion appeared related age vesicle eliminated incorporating antioxidant liposome using liposome prepared saturated phospholipid larger indicated diffusion caused phospholipid oxidation confirmed hplc analysis phospholipid phosphorus diffused membrane appeared polar indicated capacity distribute upper phase two phase extraction phospholipid phosphorus diffusion preceded complete loss liposome content indicated complete diffusion encapsulated carboxyfluorescein membrane oxidation lipid prevented inclusion either butylated hydroxytoluene alphatocopherol membrane best retention liposomal content achieved antioxidant cholesterol included liposome preparation antioxidant incorporated liposome remained effective protecting phospholipid upon storage degree month inclusion edta suspension medium retarded rapid oxidation suggesting presence trace amount heavy metal ion buffer catalyzed oxidation phospholipid oxidation effectively inhibited presence serum chemically defined medium suggesting oxidation liposomal lipid biological environment may minimized appropriate step taken

7501599,"Effect of electrical stunning amperage and peri-mortem struggle on broiler breast rigor development and meat quality. Two experiments were conducted to determine the effects of electrical stunning and peri-mortem muscle activity (struggle in and around the time of slaughter) on post-mortem biochemical reactions in broiler breast muscle (Pectoralis major). Broilers were stunned with either 50 or 125 mA or were killed without stunning. In Experiment 1 (n = 273), broilers were either physically restrained to reduce struggling during slaughter or were unrestrained and allowed to struggle freely. Breast mean pH and R-value (ratio of adenosine to inosine nucleotides) were determined at 15 min and 24 h post-mortem, and Allo-Kramer shear was determined on 48 h post-mortem cooked meat samples from muscles excised at 15 min or 24 h. In Experiment 2 (n = 65), the breast muscle was unilaterally denervated by surgically severing the Pectoralis nerve on one side and performing a sham operation on the contralateral side. Results indicated that physical restraint resulted in higher muscle pH and lower R-values at 15 min post-mortem in the unstunned birds and birds stunned at 50 mA, but had no effect on breast meat from birds stunned at 125 mA. There were no treatment effects on meat tenderness or 24-h post-mortem pH or R-values. Stunning amperage had no effect on denervated muscle pH at 15 min post-mortem, but did affect the sham-operated muscle pH and R-values as in Experiment 1.

7490559,"Inhibition of 5 alpha-reductase in genital skin fibroblasts and prostate tissue by dietary lignans and isoflavonoids. Isoflavonoids and lignans, constituents of many plant foods, have been proposed as protective agents in those populations with a low incidence of hormone-dependent cancers. They may act by their inhibition of the metabolism of growth-promoting steroid hormones. This report describes the inhibition of 5 alpha-reductase and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase by six isoflavonoids and two lignans in human genital skin fibroblast monolayers and homogenates, and in benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue homogenates. In genital skin fibroblasts, genistein, biochanin A and equol were the most potent inhibitors of 5 alpha-reductase activity, each resulting in greater than 80% inhibition at a concentration of 100 microM. The IC50 values for genistein and a seven-compound mixture were approximately 35 microM and 20 microM (2.9 microM of each compound) respectively. Of the lignans, enterolactone was the most potent inhibitor. Inhibition by biochanin A was shown to be reversible. When genital skin fibroblast homogenates were used, biochanin A was found to inhibit 5 alpha-reductase isozymes 1 and 2 to differing extents (30% and 75% respectively). Genistein was shown to inhibit 5 alpha-reductase 2 in a non-competitive nature (Vmax and Km values without and with inhibitor were 30 and 20 pmol/mg protein per h and 177 and 170 nM respectively). All of the compounds tested inhibited 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity in genital skin fibroblast monolayers.

7483025,"[Outbreak of serogroup C meningococcal disease among teenagers in Randers--preventive measures and examination of the meningococcal carrier conditions]. An outbreak involving 20 cases of serogroup C meningococcal disease, predominantly among teenagers, occurred over a seven-month period in the Randers area of Denmark. The cases were caused by a serogroup C:2a:P1.2 sulphonamide-resistant strain. The available evidence was against the transmission being related to particular schools. The outbreak was experienced as three clusters. At two schools involved in the first and the third cluster of the outbreak, 351 students were examined regarding pharyngeal carriage of meningococci, 282 of whom were tested again 17 weeks later; 308 students attending two similar schools in a nearby area were examined once. The majority of strains isolated from group C carriers in the high-risk area were serologically indistinguishable from the outbreak strain (13/14 = 95%), but less often sulphonamide-resistant (5/13 = 38%). In both areas, the overall carrier rate (30%), the overall group C rate (3%) and, the carrier rate for the outbreak strain (1%) were the same. The attack rate for the outbreak strain differed significantly: 1/40 in the high-risk area versus 1/2.500 in the normal risk area. No conditions that might explain this difference were revealed. Immediately after recognition of the first and the third cluster, 780 and 13,300 students, respectively, were vaccinated with meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine A+C. It was concluded that the definition of target groups for vaccination should be liberal, because the ""at risk"" population may be difficult to recognize at the onset of an outbreak.",Post-translational modification,outbreak serogroup meningococcal disease among teenager randerspreventive measure examination meningococcal carrier condition outbreak involving case serogroup meningococcal disease predominantly among teenager occurred sevenmonth period randers area denmark case caused serogroup cap sulphonamideresistant strain available evidence transmission related particular school outbreak experienced three cluster two school involved first third cluster outbreak student examined regarding pharyngeal carriage meningococci tested week later student attending two similar school nearby area examined majority strain isolated group carrier highrisk area serologically indistinguishable outbreak strain le often sulphonamideresistant area overall carrier rate overall group rate carrier rate outbreak strain attack rate outbreak strain differed significantly highrisk area versus normal risk area condition might explain difference revealed immediately recognition first third cluster student respectively vaccinated meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine ac concluded definition target group vaccination liberal risk population may difficult recognize onset outbreak
7476996,"Lactate dehydrogenase A subunit messenger RNA stability is synergistically regulated via the protein kinase A and C signal transduction pathways. We have identified and studied a posttranscriptional mechanism of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH) subunit gene expression at the level of mRNA stability. Using the well differentiated rat C6 glioma cell line as a model system, the effects of activators of the protein kinase A and C pathways on the half-life of LDH A mRNA were measured by two independent methods: 1) by the RNA synthesis inhibitor-chase method using actinomycin D, and 2) by analysis of decay of LDH A [3H]mRNA in [3H]uridine-labeled cells. By each method, the half-life of relatively short-lived LDH A mRNA was increased 5- to 7-fold in 8- (4-chloro-phenylthio) cAMP or forskolin-treated and about 3-fold in 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA) or dioctanoylglycerol-treated cells. Forskolin acted synergistically with TPA to prolong LDH A mRNA half-life from 55 min to more than 20 h. The relatively rapid basal decay rate of LDH A mRNA was also considerably slowed in the presence of the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, suggesting a functional role for protein phosphorylation in the stabilization process. In glioma cells stably transformed with a protein kinase A catalytic subunit expression vector, overexpression of the catalytic subunit stabilized LDH mRNA to the degree seen in forskolin-treated cells. In cells transfected with a protein kinase A inhibitor-expression vector, cAMP-mediated stabilization of LDH A mRNA half-life was prevented. Furthermore, both staurosporin and 3- [1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-indol-3-yl]-3-(indol- 3-yl)- maleimide, inhibitors of protein kinase C, prevented the TPA-induced stabilization of LDH A mRNA. We conclude from the experimental data that the protein kinase A and C signal pathways play an active functional role in regulating LDH A mRNA stability and act cooperatively to achieve LDH A mRNA stability regulation.",Post-translational modification,lactate dehydrogenase subunit messenger rna stability synergistically regulated via protein kinase signal transduction pathway identified studied posttranscriptional mechanism lactate dehydrogenase ldh subunit gene expression level mrna stability using well differentiated rat glioma cell line model system effect activator protein kinase pathway halflife ldh mrna measured two independent method rna synthesis inhibitorchase method using actinomycin analysis decay ldh hmrna huridinelabeled cell method halflife relatively shortlived ldh mrna increased fold chlorophenylthio camp forskolintreated fold tetradecanoylphorbol acetate tpa dioctanoylglyceroltreated cell forskolin acted synergistically tpa prolong ldh mrna halflife min relatively rapid basal decay rate ldh mrna also considerably slowed presence protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid suggesting functional role protein phosphorylation stabilization process glioma cell stably transformed protein kinase catalytic subunit expression vector overexpression catalytic subunit stabilized ldh mrna degree seen forskolintreated cell cell transfected protein kinase inhibitorexpression vector campmediated stabilization ldh mrna halflife prevented furthermore staurosporin dimethylaminopropylindolylindol yl maleimide inhibitor protein kinase prevented tpainduced stabilization ldh mrna conclude experimental data protein kinase signal pathway play active functional role regulating ldh mrna stability act cooperatively achieve ldh mrna stability regulation
7476966,"A somatic cell genetic method for identification of untargeted mutations in the glucocorticoid receptor that cause hormone binding deficiencies. Mouse T lymphoma cell line W7MG1, which is killed by physiological concentrations of glucocorticoid agonists, was used as a convenient genetic system for isolating sublines containing mutant glucocorticoid receptors (GR) with hormone-binding deficiencies. Partially hormone-resistant cell clones were derived from chemically mutagenized cell populations by selecting for growth in moderate concentrations of dexamethasone (Dex) and then screening for failure to grow in high Dex concentrations. Such clones are likely to have mutant GR. In GR cDNA clones from the partially resistant cell sublines, three different functionally significant mutations in the hormone-binding domain were identified: Leu-569 changed to Phe (L569F), Leu-670 to Phe (L670F), and Met-672 to Ile (M672I). Dose-response analyses with Dex and affinity labeling studies with dexamethasone 21-mesylate in transiently transfected cells indicated that all three mutant GR species had hormone-binding deficiencies. However, at saturating Dex concentrations the mutant and wild type GR activated a hormone-inducible reporter gene to the same extent; thus, these three mutations did not affect the ability of GR to activate transcription of the reporter gene after hormone was bound. In dose-response curves conducted with several glucocorticoid agonists, mutations L670F and M672I caused no change in ligand-binding specificities, while mutation L569F caused a modest change in specificity. Quantitative hormone-binding studies conducted with mutant GR synthesized in cell-free reactions showed that mutant GR species L569F and M672I had reduced Dex-binding affinities both at 0 C and at 22 C in the presence of molybdate. In contrast, for the L670F mutant, which exhibited the severest deficiency in vivo, the hormone-binding deficiency in the cell-free system was evident only at 26-37 C and primarily in the absence of molybdate. We propose that the L670F GR is an activation-labile type of mutant, which binds hormone normally in the presence of heat shock protein 90 but loses hormone rapidly after dissociation from heat shock protein 90. These three mutations define two new subregions of the GR polypeptide that are important for hormone binding.",Post-translational modification,somatic cell genetic method identification untargeted mutation glucocorticoid receptor cause hormone binding deficiency mouse lymphoma cell line wmg killed physiological concentration glucocorticoid agonist used convenient genetic system isolating sublines containing mutant glucocorticoid receptor gr hormonebinding deficiency partially hormoneresistant cell clone derived chemically mutagenized cell population selecting growth moderate concentration dexamethasone dex screening failure grow high dex concentration clone likely mutant gr gr cdna clone partially resistant cell sublines three different functionally significant mutation hormonebinding domain identified leu changed phe lf leu phe lf met ile mi doseresponse analysis dex affinity labeling study dexamethasone mesylate transiently transfected cell indicated three mutant gr specie hormonebinding deficiency however saturating dex concentration mutant wild type gr activated hormoneinducible reporter gene extent thus three mutation affect ability gr activate transcription reporter gene hormone bound doseresponse curve conducted several glucocorticoid agonist mutation lf mi caused change ligandbinding specificity mutation lf caused modest change specificity quantitative hormonebinding study conducted mutant gr synthesized cellfree reaction showed mutant gr specie lf mi reduced dexbinding affinity presence molybdate contrast lf mutant exhibited severest deficiency vivo hormonebinding deficiency cellfree system evident primarily absence molybdate propose lf gr activationlabile type mutant bind hormone normally presence heat shock protein loses hormone rapidly dissociation heat shock protein three mutation define two new subregions gr polypeptide important hormone binding

7474987,"Relationship between strength qualities and sprinting performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between strength measures and sprinting performance, and to determine if these relationships varied for different phases of sprint running. Twenty (11 males and 9 females) elite junior track and field athletes served as subjects. Athletes performed maximum sprints to 50 m from a block start and time to 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 m were recorded by electronic timing gates. The resultant forces applied to the blocks were obtained from two force platforms. Twenty-seven measures of strength and speed-strength (absolute and relative to bodyweight) were collected from the height jumped and the force-time curve recorded from the takeoff phase of vertical jumping movements utilizing pure concentric, stretch shortening cycle (SSC) and isometric muscular contractions. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the single best predictor of starting performance (2.5 m time) was the peak force (relative to bodyweight) generated during a jump from a 120 degree knee angle (concentric contraction) (r = 0.86, p = 0.0001). The single best correlate of maximum sprinting speed was the force applied at 100 ms (relative to bodyweight) from the start of a loaded jumping action (concentric contraction) (r = 0.80, p = 0.0001). SSC measures and maximum absolute strength were more related to maximum sprinting speed than starting ability. It was concluded that strength qualities were related to sprinting performance and these relationships differed for starting and maximum speed sprinting.",Post-translational modification,relationship strength quality sprinting performance purpose study investigate relationship strength measure sprinting performance determine relationship varied different phase sprint running twenty male female elite junior track field athlete served subject athlete performed maximum sprint block start time recorded electronic timing gate resultant force applied block obtained two force platform twentyseven measure strength speedstrength absolute relative bodyweight collected height jumped forcetime curve recorded takeoff phase vertical jumping movement utilizing pure concentric stretch shortening cycle ssc isometric muscular contraction pearson correlation analysis revealed single best predictor starting performance time peak force relative bodyweight generated jump degree knee angle concentric contraction single best correlate maximum sprinting speed force applied m relative bodyweight start loaded jumping action concentric contraction ssc measure maximum absolute strength related maximum sprinting speed starting ability concluded strength quality related sprinting performance relationship differed starting maximum speed sprinting
7484821,"Ability of the no-reflow phenomenon during an acute myocardial infarction to predict left ventricular dysfunction at one-month follow-up. Despite angiographically successful opening of an infarct-related vessel within a 6-hour time frame, some patients do not recover left ventricular regional wall function in the infarct zone after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Recent evidence suggests that this finding is due to the no-reflow phenomenon, or failure to recover tissue perfusion despite patient epicardial arteries. We performed myocardial contrast echocardiography to assess tissue perfusion before and after opening of an infarct-related artery. Coronary angiograms, regional wall motion scoring, and myocardial contrast enhancement were graded by 3 observers. Of 24 patients with AMI, 7 (29%) failed to recover tissue perfusion in > or = 1 region of myocardium. Of 106 regions subtended by the infarct-related artery, 16 (15%), 43 (41%), and 47 (44%) regions had no-reflow, partial, or normal flow, respectively, after arterial patency was established. There was a spectrum of reperfusion patterns ranging from no-reflow to normal perfusion. One-month follow-up angiographic and myocardial contrast echocardiographic studies were performed in 12 of the 24 patients. At 1 month, all segments of myocardium that had immediate normal perfusion had regained normal wall motion. In contrast, 17 segments that had partial or no-reflow were identified. Of these 17, 3 regained normal function, 10 segments were hypokinetic, and 4 segments were akinetic. We conclude that myocardial contrast echocardiography can be used to identify the no-reflow phenomenon in up to 29% of patients with AMI. Additionally, we found that the immediate-reflow pattern can predict degree of left ventricular dysfunction at 1-month follow-up.",Post-translational modification,ability noreflow phenomenon acute myocardial infarction predict left ventricular dysfunction onemonth followup despite angiographically successful opening infarctrelated vessel within hour time frame patient recover left ventricular regional wall function infarct zone acute myocardial infarction ami recent evidence suggests finding due noreflow phenomenon failure recover tissue perfusion despite patient epicardial artery performed myocardial contrast echocardiography ass tissue perfusion opening infarctrelated artery coronary angiogram regional wall motion scoring myocardial contrast enhancement graded observer patient ami failed recover tissue perfusion region myocardium region subtended infarctrelated artery region noreflow partial normal flow respectively arterial patency established spectrum reperfusion pattern ranging noreflow normal perfusion onemonth followup angiographic myocardial contrast echocardiographic study performed patient month segment myocardium immediate normal perfusion regained normal wall motion contrast segment partial noreflow identified regained normal function segment hypokinetic segment akinetic conclude myocardial contrast echocardiography used identify noreflow phenomenon patient ami additionally found immediatereflow pattern predict degree left ventricular dysfunction month followup

To explain the variation in total real hospital costs among elderly patients who died between 1984 and 1991, a cohort analytic study of the nationally representative sample of elderly subjects included in the Longitudinal Study on Aging (N = 7,527) was carried out. The cohort comprised the subset of 1,778 community-dwelling Americans who were age 70 years and older in 1984, had one or more subsequent hospital episodes, and died by 1991. Hospital charges for 1984 through 1991 were taken from the Medicare Automated Data Retrieval System. Annual hospital charges were adjusted for inflation (restated in 1984 dollars) using the hospital market basket component of the consumer price index. The natural logarithm of aggregated real charges was used in the analysis. Mean total real hospital charges were $24,956 (SD = $27,847). A standard multivariable regression model explained 9.7% of the variance in real total hospital charges. After incorporating additional measures reflecting a respondent's distribution (mean and standard deviation) of comorbidities (as measured by the number of ICD-9-CM codes [truncated at five]) during all hospitalizations in the observation window, the cause of death, and the concentration of charges in the last year of life, the explained variance increased to 29.3%. The most important explanatory factors were the two variables controlling for the distribution of comorbidity, the variable controlling for population density, and the dichotomous variable indicating that the patient's death was related to an acute myocardial infarction.

A modified severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model of HIV infection which utilized multiple reconstitutions with human lymphocytes and a large inoculum of HIV was investigated. This mouse model yielded splenic HIV p24 antigen concentrations detectable by standard clinical means. The concentration of p24 exceeded 600 pg/g of spleen through 4 weeks postinfection. A 1-week course of AZT therapy initiated after infection produced a dose responsive reduction in p24 antigen burden. Up to a 95% reduction in p24 antigen burden was observed following AZT therapy at 50 mg/kg/day, while AZT therapy at 5 and 0.5 mg/kg/day produced 52 and 18% reductions. In vitro and pharmacokinetic evaluations correlated potency and tissue concentrations of AZT with treatment efficacy. Active HIV replication in the SCID mice was suggested by both the recovery of viable virus from SCID spleens, and by the efficacy of a brief course of AZT therapy. This SCID mouse model of HIV infection was more quantitative than previous mouse models that utilize PCR-based techniques for detection of HIV. The high HIV burden in this SCID mouse model allowed reductions in p24 concentration to be monitored in response to AZT therapy. A dose response to AZT therapy was demonstrated, even when the first dose was administered after infection. This result suggests greater sensitivity than in previous models in which pretreatment with AZT was required to produce a protective response.

7479497,"Evidence of a ventilation-perfusion mismatch during acute unilateral pulmonary artery occlusion in broilers. A ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch can be diagnosed when a moderate increase in cardiac output (CO) causes systemic hypoxemia, thereby exposing a pulmonary incapacity to fully oxygenate the additional blood flowing through the pulmonary vasculature. The susceptibility of broiler chickens to hypoxemia was evaluated in lightly anesthetized, clinically healthy, 40- to 49-d-old males. A snare placed around one pulmonary artery permitted acute, reversible shunting of the entire CO through the unobstructed lung. Blood samples were withdrawn from arterial and venous cannulas for blood gas analysis, and a pulse oximeter was used for noninvasive measurements of the percentage saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen in arterialized capillary beds. The partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood averaged 103 mm Hg during control periods, 79 mm Hg (hypoxemia) when the pulmonary artery snare was tightened for 12 min, and 101 mm Hg within 5 min after releasing the snare. The percentage saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen before, during, and after tightening the snare averaged, respectively, 96, 91, and 96% for arterial blood, 81, 55, and 78% for venous blood, and 87, 67, and 88% for arterialized capillary beds. Tightening the snare increased the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and the hydrogen ion concentration above control levels in both arterial and venous blood, and these variables returned to control levels upon release of the snare.

7476873,"The tef1 box, a ubiquitous cis-acting element involved in the activation of plant genes that are highly expressed in cycling cells. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the tef1 box is a cis-acting promoter element of the EF-1 alpha A1 gene involved in the activation of transcription in meristematic tissues. The initiation of root calli in transgenic Arabidopsis by 2,4-D shows that the tef1-dependent expression of the GUS reporter gene is not restricted to meristematic regions but involves all of the cycling cells. Hybridization experiments conducted using Arabidopsis cDNA clones organized in a dense array on filters, and cDNA probes prepared from cells in various states of growth, or blocked at different steps of the cell cycle, indicate that the enhanced expression of EF-1 alpha genes occurs in cycling cells at the point of entry into the cell cycle and remains constant during transit through the cycle. The analysis of several promoters of genes, other than EF-1 alpha, which are overexpressed in growing cells and involved in the processes of translation or redox regulation, reveals the presence of sequences showing partial homologies with the tef1 box. The Arabidopsis ribosomal gene srp18 and the tobacco gene thioh2, encoding a thioredoxin h, contain such sequences. Gel retardation experiments suggest that these sequences are targets for the same proteins as those that interact with the tef1 box of the Arabidopsis EF-1 alpha A1 gene. In transfected Arabidopsis protoplasts, the putative tef1 sequence thioh2 partially restores the activity of a tef1 box-less EF-1 alpha A1 promoter.

7476862,"Functional analysis of the Drosophila CDC2 Dm gene in fission yeast. The cdc2+ gene product (p34cdc2) is a protein kinase that regulates entry into mitosis in all eukaryotic cells. The role that p34cdc2 plays in the cell cycle has been extensively investigated in a number of organisms, including the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. To study the degree of functional conservation among evolutionarily distant p34cdc2 proteins, we have constructed a S. pombe strain in which the yeast cdc2+ gene has been replaced by its Drosophila homologue CDC2Dm (the CDC2Dm strain). This CDC2Dm S. pombe strain is viable, capable of mating and producing four viable meiotic products, indicating that the fly p34CDC2Dm recognizes all the essential S. pombe cdc2+ substrates, and that it is recognized by cyclin partners and other elements required for its activity. The p34CDC2Dm protein yields a lethal phenotype in combination with the mutant B-type cyclin p56cdc13-117, suggesting that this S. pombe cyclin might interact less efficiently with the Drosophila protein than with its native p34cdc2 counterpart. This CDC2Dm strain also responds to nutritional starvation and to incomplete DNA synthesis, indicating that proteins involved in these signal transduction pathways, interact properly with p34CDC2Dm (and/or that p34cdc2-independent pathways are used).

7470082,"Distribution of secretory component in hepatocytes and its mode of transfer into bile. Immunoglobin A in bile and other external secretions is mostly bound to a glycoprotein known as secretory component. This glycoprotein is not synthesized by the same cells as immunoglobulin A and is not found in blood. We now report the mechanism by which secretory component reaches the bile and describe its function in immunoglobulin A transport across the hepatocyte. Fractionation of rat liver homogenates by zonal centrifugation was followed by measurement of the amounts of secretory component in the various fractions by rocket immunoelectrophoresis. Secretory component was found in two fractions. One of these was identified as containing Golgi vesicles from its isopycnic density and appearance in the electron microscope; the other contained principally fragments of the plasma membrane of the sinusoidal face of the hepatocyte, as shown by its particle size and content of marker enzymes. Only the latter fraction bound (125)I-labelled immunoglobulin A added in vitro. At 5min after intravenous injection of [(14)C]fucose, the secretory component in the Golgi fraction was labelled, but not that in the plasma membrane. The secretory component in the sinusoidal plasma membrane did, however, become labelled before the first labelled secretory component appeared in bile, about 30min after injection. We suggest that fucose is added to the newly synthesized secretory component in the Golgi apparatus. The secretory component then passes, with the other newly secreted glycoproteins, to the sinusoidal plasma membrane. There it remains bound but exposed to the blood and able to bind any polymeric immunoglobulin A present in serum. The secretory component then moves across the hepatocyte to the bile-canalicular face in association with the endocytic-shuttle vesicles which carry immunoglobulin A. Hence there is a lag before newly synthesized secretory component appears in bile.",Post-translational modification,distribution secretory component hepatocytes mode transfer bile immunoglobin bile external secretion mostly bound glycoprotein known secretory component glycoprotein synthesized cell immunoglobulin found blood report mechanism secretory component reach bile describe function immunoglobulin transport across hepatocyte fractionation rat liver homogenate zonal centrifugation followed measurement amount secretory component various fraction rocket immunoelectrophoresis secretory component found two fraction one identified containing golgi vesicle isopycnic density appearance electron microscope contained principally fragment plasma membrane sinusoidal face hepatocyte shown particle size content marker enzyme latter fraction bound ilabelled immunoglobulin added vitro min intravenous injection cfucose secretory component golgi fraction labelled plasma membrane secretory component sinusoidal plasma membrane however become labelled first labelled secretory component appeared bile min injection suggest fucose added newly synthesized secretory component golgi apparatus secretory component pass newly secreted glycoprotein sinusoidal plasma membrane remains bound exposed blood able bind polymeric immunoglobulin present serum secretory component move across hepatocyte bilecanalicular face association endocyticshuttle vesicle carry immunoglobulin hence lag newly synthesized secretory component appears bile

7473580,"Steroidal spiro-gamma-lactones that inhibit 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity in human placental microsomes. The important enzyme 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 beta-HSD) is known to regulate intracellular levels of biologically active steroids, namely, androgens and estrogens. In an effort to develop potent inhibitors of 17 beta-HSD for reducing the levels of active steroids, we found that steroidal spiro-gamma-lactones inhibit 17 beta-HSD activity. In this report, we describe the synthesis of 11 spiro-gamma-lactone analogs containing a steroidal C-18 or C-19 nucleus and compare their relative inhibitory effects on 17 beta-HSD activity in the human placenta microsomes that catalyze the interconversion of androgens and estrogens. To void the interaction of the cytosolic 17 beta-HSD activity that is specific for the interconversion of estrone and estradiol, we used 4-androstenedione as substrate. Analysis of the inhibitory effect exerted by these analogs on microsomal 17 beta-HSD activity indicates that spiro-gamma-lactones containing the C-18 nucleus are more potent inhibitors than C-19 nucleus analogs. The best inhibition was obtained with the phenolic spiro-gamma-lactone 7 (3-hydroxy-19-nor-17 alpha-pregna-1,3,5(10)-triene 21,17-carbolactone), which has an IC50 value of 0.27 microM, and was much lower than the competitive effect of the unlabeled substrate 4-androstenedione, which has an IC50 value of 1.40 microM. Preincubation with lactone 7 did not inactivate 17 beta-HSD activity. The results thus suggest that lactone 7 is a reversible in inhibitor. Lactone 7 is selective for microsomal 17 beta-HSD activity, as no inhibition was observed for cytosolic 17 beta-HSD activity.",Post-translational modification,steroidal spirogammalactones inhibit betahydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity human placental microsome important enzyme betahydroxysteroid dehydrogenase betahsd known regulate intracellular level biologically active steroid namely androgen estrogen effort develop potent inhibitor betahsd reducing level active steroid found steroidal spirogammalactones inhibit betahsd activity report describe synthesis spirogammalactone analog containing steroidal nucleus compare relative inhibitory effect betahsd activity human placenta microsome catalyze interconversion androgen estrogen void interaction cytosolic betahsd activity specific interconversion estrone estradiol used androstenedione substrate analysis inhibitory effect exerted analog microsomal betahsd activity indicates spirogammalactones containing nucleus potent inhibitor nucleus analog best inhibition obtained phenolic spirogammalactone hydroxynor alphapregnatriene carbolactone ic value microm much lower competitive effect unlabeled substrate androstenedione ic value microm preincubation lactone inactivate betahsd activity result thus suggest lactone reversible inhibitor lactone selective microsomal betahsd activity inhibition observed cytosolic betahsd activity

Effects of vinblastine on cell ultrastructure and synthesis and secretion of proteins were studied in rat mammary epithelial cells. At high concentrations, this alkaloid induced drastic structural alterations in secretory epithelia both in vivo and in vitro including cytoplasmic swelling, depolarization and vesiculation of rough endoplasmic reticulum. At lower concentrations, vinblastine induced structural changes similar to those induced by colchicine using the same system. Secretory vesicles accumulated in the cytoplasm, there was hypertrophy of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and portions of the rough endoplasmic reticulum became vesiculated and engorged with electron-dense material. Microtubules were absent but paracrystalline structures were frequently observed associated with Golgi components. In vitro biochemical studies with dissociated alveoli demonstrated that vinblastine inhibited both the synthesis and secretion of protein.

7484585,"An imaging algorithm for the differential diagnosis of adrenal adenomas and metastases. The purpose of this study was to develop an algorithm using CT and chemical-shift MR imaging for the characterization of adrenal masses in patients with a primary cancer and no other evidence of metastatic disease. Thirty-three patients with 37 adrenal masses (19 metastases, 18 adenomas), all of whom had a known primary cancer, were studied with noncontrast CT and chemical-shift MR imaging (1.5 T). Lesion size and density in Hounsfield units (H) were determined by CT. Adrenal signal intensity normalized to that of spleen was used to calculate adrenal-spleen ratio (ASR), defined as the percentage of signal remaining in the opposed-phase image relative to the in-phase image. Lesions less than or equal to 0 H were classified as benign, lesions greater than 20 H were regarded as malignant, and lesions between 0 and 20 H were regarded as indeterminate. Diagnoses were confirmed by biopsy (for 19 lesions) or by follow-up imaging (for 18 lesions). An imaging algorithm was derived by determining the relative value of CT and MR imaging for diagnosing the lesions. The reimbursement rates for CT-guided biopsy and MR imaging of the abdomen were obtained from Medicare. All 13 lesions of 0 or less H were correctly classified as benign by CT. ASR was less than 70 in 10 of these 13. In another 13 lesions, H was greater than 20; all were malignant and all had an ASR greater than 80. Of 11 CT-indeterminate lesions, four of five adenomas had an ASR less than 70, and four of six metastases had an ASR greater than 80. Two malignant lesions had ASRs between 70 and 80 and were diagnosed by biopsy findings. One CT-indeterminate adenoma had an ASR of 84 and was diagnosed by biopsy findings. The reimbursement rate by Medicare is similar for CT-guided biopsy with pathologic interpretation and for MR imaging of the abdomen. An algorithm was developed for diagnosis of adrenal lesions that uses the density reading on noncontrast CT as the first step, with chemical-shift MR imaging for CT-indeterminate lesions. In this algorithm, lesions of 0 H or less may be regarded as benign and further work-up is not required. Lesions with a density greater than 20 H are likely malignant and should be biopsied when the result will influence management. For CT-indeterminate lesions, we recommend chemical-shift MR imaging. An ASR threshold of 70 indicates a benign lesion, and no further workup is required in these patients. Lesions with an ASR greater than 70 should have a biopsy performed, depending on the clinical situation. The above algorithm is cost-effective and reduces the number of biopsies required without reducing the sensitivity of detecting malignant lesions.",Post-translational modification,imaging algorithm differential diagnosis adrenal adenoma metastasis purpose study develop algorithm using ct chemicalshift mr imaging characterization adrenal mass patient primary cancer evidence metastatic disease thirtythree patient adrenal mass metastasis adenoma known primary cancer studied noncontrast ct chemicalshift mr imaging lesion size density hounsfield unit determined ct adrenal signal intensity normalized spleen used calculate adrenalspleen ratio asr defined percentage signal remaining opposedphase image relative inphase image lesion le equal classified benign lesion greater regarded malignant lesion regarded indeterminate diagnosis confirmed biopsy lesion followup imaging lesion imaging algorithm derived determining relative value ct mr imaging diagnosing lesion reimbursement rate ctguided biopsy mr imaging abdomen obtained medicare lesion le correctly classified benign ct asr le another lesion greater malignant asr greater ctindeterminate lesion four five adenoma asr le four six metastasis asr greater two malignant lesion asrs diagnosed biopsy finding one ctindeterminate adenoma asr diagnosed biopsy finding reimbursement rate medicare similar ctguided biopsy pathologic interpretation mr imaging abdomen algorithm developed diagnosis adrenal lesion us density reading noncontrast ct first step chemicalshift mr imaging ctindeterminate lesion algorithm lesion le may regarded benign workup required lesion density greater likely malignant biopsied result influence management ctindeterminate lesion recommend chemicalshift mr imaging asr threshold indicates benign lesion workup required patient lesion asr greater biopsy performed depending clinical situation algorithm costeffective reduces number biopsy required without reducing sensitivity detecting malignant lesion

7482552,"Cancer and non-cancer risk assessment: not so different if you consider mechanisms. Default risk assessment procedures use threshold models for non-carcinogens and a non-threshold model for carcinogens. This a priori distinction reflects the fact that the default procedures do not consider mechanisms of action of specific chemicals. When mechanisms are considered, the distinction is not necessary. Starting with the premise that the goal of risk assessment is to identify actual risk for specific chemicals, three major, generic components of the overall mechanism translating exposure into a response of regulatory interest are identified. These are the specific mechanisms linking (1) exposure with dose to target tissue, (2) target tissue dose with short-term responses such as cytolethality or mutation, and (3) short-term responses with ensuing long-term responses such as cancer or cirrhosis. (Short-term responses may be regulatory end points of interest, or they may be intermediate steps on the way to longer-term sequelae). On-going research on formaldehyde and chloroform is described to illustrate how these three components of the overall mechanism can be examined experimentally and used in specific models. The impact of mechanism-based risk assessment on uncertainty is also considered. Uncertainty is a function of the extent to which the model used for risk assessment misspecifies the actual mechanism of action for the chemical in question. There is a trade-off between (a) mechanism-based models that may reduce uncertainty but are expensive and time-consuming to develop and (b) default models that are not chemical-specific but can be used with minimal data sets. Experience with mechanism-based risk assessment may allow modification of default procedures to minimize this trade-off. A future default procedure for carcinogen risk assessment might allow specification of mode of action. For example, while DNA reactive-carcinogens would still be assumed to have linear low-dose risk, carcinogens acting through purely cytotoxic mechanisms might be assumed to have sharply non-linear or even threshold dose-response curves.",Post-translational modification,cancer noncancer risk assessment different consider mechanism default risk assessment procedure use threshold model noncarcinogens nonthreshold model carcinogen priori distinction reflects fact default procedure consider mechanism action specific chemical mechanism considered distinction necessary starting premise goal risk assessment identify actual risk specific chemical three major generic component overall mechanism translating exposure response regulatory interest identified specific mechanism linking exposure dose target tissue target tissue dose shortterm response cytolethality mutation shortterm response ensuing longterm response cancer cirrhosis shortterm response may regulatory end point interest may intermediate step way longerterm sequela ongoing research formaldehyde chloroform described illustrate three component overall mechanism examined experimentally used specific model impact mechanismbased risk assessment uncertainty also considered uncertainty function extent model used risk assessment misspecifies actual mechanism action chemical question tradeoff mechanismbased model may reduce uncertainty expensive timeconsuming develop default model chemicalspecific used minimal data set experience mechanismbased risk assessment may allow modification default procedure minimize tradeoff future default procedure carcinogen risk assessment might allow specification mode action example dna reactivecarcinogens still assumed linear lowdose risk carcinogen acting purely cytotoxic mechanism might assumed sharply nonlinear even threshold doseresponse curve

Twenty cases of persistent cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, 2 of transient leaks, and 2 of late meningitis occurring in a series of 156 posterior fossa acoustic neuroma removals were studied. Prophylaxis of leaks was usually attempted by filling opened air cells in the drilled internal auditory canal (IAC) with bone wax.

Most leaks were diagnosed within 1 week of surgery, although 1 occurred 4 years postoperatively. Those seen later were usually recurrences of a previously repaired leak or cases of meningitis. Leaks were more common later in the series when a more lateral unroofing of the IAC was used.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate maternal activin A serum concentration in pregnant women with chronic hypertension (n = 14), pregnancy-induced hypertension (n = 10) or pre-eclampsia (n = 16). In the group of pregnant women with chronic hypertension and of healthy pregnant women (n = 10) activin A was measured in samples collected longitudinally throughout gestation. Using a specific two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, it has been possible to measure maternal serum activin A concentration. In addition, the effect of recombinant human activin A administration on mean arterial pressure and heart rate in female rats have been also investigated. Mean +/- SEM of maternal serum activin A concentration in pre-eclamptic women (57.4 +/- 28.3 ng/ml), was significantly higher than in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension (14.8 +/- 10.5 ng/ml), chronic hypertension (10.3 +/- 5.4 ng/ml) or healthy control women (9.2 +/- 9.4 ng/ml) (P < 0.01). Serum activin A levels evaluated 2 weeks after anti-hypertensive treatment were not significantly different in pre-eclamptic women. Moreover, when exogenous recombinant human activin A was administered in female rats arterial pressure or frequency of heart rate did not change.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)/Chemotherapy mobilized peripheral blood progenitors are an effective source of stem cells which affords rapid and complete hematopoietic engraftment after myeloablative chemotherapy regimens. The dose of G-CSF most commonly used for mobilization is 5 micrograms/kg. We measured G-CSF levels in patients with chemosensitive malignancies undergoing peripheral stem cell harvest to determine whether there was a relationship between serum G-CSF levels and the yield of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) were mobilized by chemotherapy followed by G-CSF (5 micrograms/kg) started 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy. PBSCs were collected by daily leukapheresis during G-CSF stimulation once the WBC had recovered to 1.0 x 10(9)/L, with 10 liters of blood processed using a Fenwall CS 3000. G-CSF levels were monitored daily before and after leukapheresis. CD34+ cells from daily leukapheresis collections were determined in 11 patients.

Right and left ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF; LVEF) were determined in patients with severe chronic pulmonary disease (mean +/- SEM [FEV1 percent predicted 36 +/- 3%; PaO2: 64 +/- 3 mm Hg]), utilizing first pass radionuclide angiocardiography. RVEF and LVEF were measured at rest and again during upright bicycle exercise while patients breathed room air, and again during low flow oxygen (O2) administration. Mean RVEF was abnormal (less than 45%) at rest and did not increase with exercise while subjects breathed room air (44 +/- 2 percent vs 44 +/- 3 percent, P = ns), but improved significantly during exercise while patients breathed O2 (45 +/- 5 percent vs 51 +/- 3 percent, P less than .05).

7479806,"Research in speech communication. Advances in digital speech processing are now supporting application and deployment of a variety of speech technologies for human/machine communication. In fact, new businesses are rapidly forming about these technologies. But these capabilities are of little use unless society can afford them. Happily, explosive advances in microelectronics over the past two decades have assured affordable access to this sophistication as well as to the underlying computing technology. The research challenges in speech processing remain in the traditionally identified areas of recognition, synthesis, and coding. These three areas have typically been addressed individually, often with significant isolation among the efforts. But they are all facets of the same fundamental issue--how to represent and quantify the information in the speech signal. This implies deeper understanding of the physics of speech production, the constraints that the conventions of language impose, and the mechanism for information processing in the auditory system. In ongoing research, therefore, we seek more accurate models of speech generation, better computational formulations of language, and realistic perceptual guides for speech processing--along with ways to coalesce the fundamental issues of recognition, synthesis, and coding. Successful solution will yield the long-sought dictation machine, high-quality synthesis from text, and the ultimate in low bit-rate transmission of speech.

Enterocolitis associated with Hirschsprung's disease (HEC) remains a major source of morbidity and even mortality, both before and after definitive surgical treatment. This study was undertaken to investigate whether histopathologic mucosal changes, in the absence of clinical manifestations of HEC, could predict the subsequent development of this complication. The clinical data and histopathology of 25 patients who eventually developed clinical HEC were compared with a control group of 25 age- and sex-matched patients with Hirschsprung's disease (HD) but with no clinical HEC either preoperatively or postoperatively. The histopathologic findings of tissue obtained by rectal biopsy or during laparotomy were graded from 0 to V according to severity and compared with the eventual clinical course. This study showed that (1) histopathologic findings of HEC appear to predict the clinical development, but not the severity, of future episodes of clinical HEC; (2) a histological grade of > or = II (> or = 2 crypt abscesses per high power field) should raise suspicion for subsequent occurrence of HEC, whereas a grade of > or = III (multiple crypt abscesses) places a child at high risk for development of clinical HEC; and (3) contrary to what is generally thought, histopathologic changes of HEC occur in both ganglionic and aganglionic segments.

The role of pontine reticula units (PRU) responding to afferent impulses from the distal colon and anal mucosa was studied in dogs. The 465 PRU were classified into 4 groups on the basis of the pattern of discharge in response to afferent stimulation (AS) of rectal branches (RB) of the pelvic nerve: Group I (G-I) responded with a short burst (latency, 36 +/- 16 msec); G-II responded with an early short burst (latency, 41 +/- 21 msec), followed by a late long-lasting train of spikes (latency, 187 +/- 110 msec); and G-III responded with a long-lasting train of spikes (latency, 189 +/- 130 msec). G-IV had spontaneous discharges which were temporally inhibited by AS. G-II and G-III PRU showed remarkable facilitation  similar to that of the long latency reflex discharges of RB. G-I PRU showed habituation. Most of G-II and G-III PRU discharged simultaneously with the reflex discharges of RB; these cause the contractions of defecation in the distal colon.

7470905,"Distribution of membrane glycoproteins among the organelles of a single identified neuron of Aplysia. II. Isolation and characterization of a glycoprotein associated with vesicles. Glycoprotein-I (mol.wt. 180,000) is associated with a vesicle fraction from the cytoplasm of R2, the giant cholinergic neuron in the abdominal ganglion. Electron microscopy has shown that R2 contains both lucent and compound vesicles. We have used anisomycin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, to provide evidence that Component-I is a constituent of somatic compound vesicles. In the presence of the drug, [3H]N-acetylgalactosamine injected into R2 is incorporated almost exclusively into Component-I. Quantitative electron microscopic radioautography of treated cells shows a marked increase in the proportion of silver grains over compound vesicles and a decrease in labeling of other organelles compared with untreated cells. Analysis of Component-I, isolated using the chaotropic agent lithium diiodosalicylate, shows it to contain fucose, N-acetylgalactosamine, and N-acetylglucosamine. Proteolytic digestion with pronase yields a complex pattern of glycopeptides. The proportion of [3H]N-acetyl-galactosamine in these glycopeptides is altered in the presence of anisomycin. These results together with radioautographic analyses suggest that large carbohydrate chains are elaborated within the endoplasmic reticulum and that smaller chains are added in the Golgi region or on the membrane of the compound vesicle.",Post-translational modification,distribution membrane glycoprotein among organelle single identified neuron aplysia ii isolation characterization glycoprotein associated vesicle glycoproteini molwt associated vesicle fraction cytoplasm giant cholinergic neuron abdominal ganglion electron microscopy shown contains lucent compound vesicle used anisomycin inhibitor protein synthesis provide evidence componenti constituent somatic compound vesicle presence drug hnacetylgalactosamine injected incorporated almost exclusively componenti quantitative electron microscopic radioautography treated cell show marked increase proportion silver grain compound vesicle decrease labeling organelle compared untreated cell analysis componenti isolated using chaotropic agent lithium diiodosalicylate show contain fucose nacetylgalactosamine nacetylglucosamine proteolytic digestion pronase yield complex pattern glycopeptides proportion hnacetylgalactosamine glycopeptides altered presence anisomycin result together radioautographic analysis suggest large carbohydrate chain elaborated within endoplasmic reticulum smaller chain added golgi region membrane compound vesicle

7476027,"Differential effects of cysteamine on heat shock protein induction and cytoplasmic granulation in astrocytes and glioma cells. The sulfhydryl agent, cysteamine (CSH), promotes the accumulation of autofluorescent, peroxidase-positive cytoplasmic granules in cultured astroglia akin to those which naturally accumulate in astrocytes of the aging periventricular brain. Both in vitro and in situ, CSH rapidly induces various heat shock proteins (HSP) in astrocytes long before granulation occurs. In the present study, we determined that CSH treatment resulted in an increase in HSP 27, HSP 90 and heme oxygenase (HO-1) at both the protein and mRNA level. We also showed that C6 glioma cells, unlike primary astrocytes, constitutively express HSP 27, HSP 90 and HO-1 at low levels. Moreover, CSH is incapable of eliciting further HSP expression or inducing granulation in the glioma cells. Our results support the hypothesis that the biogenesis of redox-active astrocytic inclusions in CSH-treated glial cultures and in the aging periventricular brain is dependent on an antecedent cellular stress response.",Post-translational modification,differential effect cysteamine heat shock protein induction cytoplasmic granulation astrocyte glioma cell sulfhydryl agent cysteamine csh promotes accumulation autofluorescent peroxidasepositive cytoplasmic granule cultured astroglia akin naturally accumulate astrocyte aging periventricular brain vitro situ csh rapidly induces various heat shock protein hsp astrocyte long granulation occurs present study determined csh treatment resulted increase hsp hsp heme oxygenase ho protein mrna level also showed glioma cell unlike primary astrocyte constitutively express hsp hsp ho low level moreover csh incapable eliciting hsp expression inducing granulation glioma cell result support hypothesis biogenesis redoxactive astrocytic inclusion cshtreated glial culture aging periventricular brain dependent antecedent cellular stress response

7472415,"In a rat model of parkinsonism, lesions of the subthalamic nucleus reverse increases of reaction time but induce a dramatic premature responding deficit. Lesions of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) have been found to reduce the severe akinetic motor symptom produced in animal models of Parkinson's disease, such as in monkeys treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or in monoamine-depleted rats. However, little is known about the effect of STN exclusion on subtle motor deficits induced by moderate dopaminergic lesions in complex motor tasks. The present study was thus performed on rats trained in a reaction time (RT) task known to be extremely sensitive to variations of dopamine transmission in the striatum. Animals were trained to release a lever after the onset of a visual stimulus within a time limit to obtain a food reward. Discrete dopamine depletion produced by infusing the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) bilaterally into the dorsal part of the striatum, produced motor initiation deficits which were revealed by an increase in the number of delayed responses (lever release after the time limit) and a lengthening of RTs. In contrast, bilateral excitotoxic lesion of the STN with ibotenic acid induced severe behavioral deficits which were opposite to those produced by the dopaminergic lesion, as shown by an increase in the number of premature responses (lever release before the onset of the visual stimulus) and a decrease of RTs. Surprisingly, the performance of the animals bearing a double lesion (striatal dopaminergic lesion followed 14 d later by STN ibotenic lesion) was still impaired 40 d after the ibotenic lesion. As expected, the 6-OHDA-induced motor initiation deficits were reversed by a subsequent STN lesion. However, the dramatic increase of premature responses contributing to major behavioral deficits induced by the STN lesion remained unchanged. Thus, the bilateral lesion of the STN was found to alleviate the motor deficits in this model of parkinsonism, but essentially produced over time, long lasting deficits that might be related to dyskinesia or cognitive impairment. The present results strongly support the recent concept of a predominant control of the STN on basal ganglia output structures.",Post-translational modification,rat model parkinsonism lesion subthalamic nucleus reverse increase reaction time induce dramatic premature responding deficit lesion subthalamic nucleus stn found reduce severe akinetic motor symptom produced animal model parkinson disease monkey treated methylphenyltetrahydropyridine mptp monoaminedepleted rat however little known effect stn exclusion subtle motor deficit induced moderate dopaminergic lesion complex motor task present study thus performed rat trained reaction time rt task known extremely sensitive variation dopamine transmission striatum animal trained release lever onset visual stimulus within time limit obtain food reward discrete dopamine depletion produced infusing neurotoxin hydroxydopamine ohda bilaterally dorsal part striatum produced motor initiation deficit revealed increase number delayed response lever release time limit lengthening rts contrast bilateral excitotoxic lesion stn ibotenic acid induced severe behavioral deficit opposite produced dopaminergic lesion shown increase number premature response lever release onset visual stimulus decrease rts surprisingly performance animal bearing double lesion striatal dopaminergic lesion followed later stn ibotenic lesion still impaired ibotenic lesion expected ohdainduced motor initiation deficit reversed subsequent stn lesion however dramatic increase premature response contributing major behavioral deficit induced stn lesion remained unchanged thus bilateral lesion stn found alleviate motor deficit model parkinsonism essentially produced time long lasting deficit might related dyskinesia cognitive impairment present result strongly support recent concept predominant control stn basal ganglion output structure
